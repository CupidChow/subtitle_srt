Episode 1

2
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:17,100
From time immemorial, there were two suns in the sky, 

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,030
as well as two moons.

4
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:28,632
Thus, the days were extremely hot, and the nights were very cold.

5
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:35,460
All of creation was in chaos, and mankind was miserable.

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:43,097
Then, a hero appeared and used arrows to shoot down one sun and one moon.

7
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:47,512
Only then was there peace in the world.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,500
It is true...

9
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:06,927
Isn't that right, nephew?

10
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:12,281
Even though he was born out of a different womb
he considers his half-brother as within his own bloodline.

11
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:17,103
Even though he was born out of a different womb
he considers his half-brother as within his own bloodline.

12
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,344
That is why...

13
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:24,143
There are villainous groups forming that treat Prince Ui Seong as the king.

14
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:26,980
So, what can we do?

15
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:32,320
We cannot sit and wait patiently for a hero to appear.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,588
I apologize, but I do not understand the deeper meaning of the words the Queen Dowager is using.

17
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:42,649
Become the savior.

18
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,647
Prove your loyalty.

19
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,456
When His Majesty waivers so that he can't act directly...

20
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:51,979
Become the hero by acting forcefully.

21
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:59,321
There is only one sun in the sky and there is only one throne in the palace.

22
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:04,840
The very existence of Prince Ui Seong is a threat to the king's tenure on the throne.

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,433
He is a "sun" that must be shot down at any cost.

24
00:02:18,152 --> 00:03:24,932

25
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,900
(Prince Ui Seong- King Seong Jo's
 younger half brother) 
 Who gave you an order to kill me?                                                                      Whose orders are you acting under?

26
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,700
What's wrong?

27
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,946
What's going on?

28
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,303
Where do you think you are going at this time of the night?

29
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:03,125
Didn't you sense it too?

30
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:07,492
It was a murderous aura for sure.

31
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,765
Even if you go, there is nothing you can do.

32
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:14,668
Nevertheless, I am compelled to go.

33
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,804
That person...

34
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:20,207
That person is in danger!

35
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,055
A-ri!

36
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:24,545
Ari!

37
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:28,215
Ari!

38
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,385
Ari!

39
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,471
Halt!

40
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:54,935
It has been awhile...

41
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,704
Lord (Prince) Ui Seong.

42
00:05:56,704 --> 00:06:00,241
You, who came and went through my doorway so freely...

43
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:04,745
and you who tried to use me as a means of support to gain power...

44
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:07,172
Did you find a different tactic?

45
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:11,893
Or did you find a different person to support?

46
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,773
I did.

47
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:19,232
I'm thinking about supporting the king now.

48
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:24,388
Didn't you say that even a dog or a cow desires power lately?

49
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:27,868
Isn't it true that politics are for a worthy person...

50
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,871
Not for just anyone?

51
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:35,445
His Majesty is not a person to be swayed
by a false conspiracy!

52
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,544
His Majesty ...

53
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:40,014
Who do you think he will believe?

54
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:47,791
Unfortunately, there will be no chance for you to meet His Majesty.

55
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:53,727
Before you can ever meet him, 
I will guide you to the heavens.

56
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:58,172
Do not fear...

57
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:03,684
Your best friend, Lord Dae Seon...

58
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:06,140
will be waiting ahead for you.

59
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:30,898
Why did he...

60
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,966
WHY HIM?!?!

61
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:38,839
All the so-called criticsm he sends up are all aimed at the king's maternal relatives.

62
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,277
It's no wonder that the Queen Dowager, the King's mother, is unhappy.

63
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,887
It is a beautiful night.

64
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:13,040
If the moonlight accompanies you, 
then going to the grave isn't so bad.

65
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,214
Follow her!

66
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,303
This belongs to a shaman from the Royal Office of Shamans. [Seongsucheong]

67
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:51,438
Search around here carefully!

68
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:55,242
If she's alive, we must kill her. 
If she's dead, we must find her body!

69
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:56,443
Yes sir!

70
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,243
The Chief Shaman is here.

71
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:47,328
Where is Ari?

72
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,982
That is-

73
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:02,098
Ari..

74
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:03,696
Ari, is it?

75
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:12,600
She is said to have divine powers.  She and Nok Young are candidates for the future Chief Shaman position.

76
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,500
She is wounded so she couldn't have gone far.

77
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,700
We're searching the entire forest so, soon...

78
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:23,451
Love between a royal and a shaman?

79
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
It seems as though the heavens are aiding us.

80
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,700
I do not know what you mean.

81
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:32,987
That girl, Ari, was a slave in Prince Ui Seong's home.

82
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:36,571
If there were something between those two, then a lot of people probably know about it.

83
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,700
Then isn't it more dangerous?

84
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,000
Why is that?

85
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,700
For a woman, love includes sacrificing herself for love.

86
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:52,820
It is not impossible that, risking death, that girl, who witnessed everything, is rushing to the palace.

87
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,380
If we can't immediately find the girl .....

88
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:02,623
What if she hopes that the person she loves should sit on the throne,

89
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:08,344
and she has created a talisman to fulfill that hope?

90
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,300
It is in the realm of probability.

91
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,800
However,

92
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,164
we don't have any evidence of that girl using a talisman.

93
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:17,418
The Chief Shaman of the Office of Royal Shamans does my bidding.

94
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:20,107
What is the problem?

95
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,594
Marshall your forces.

96
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,492
On imperial orders arrest the traitor.

97
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:53,556
[King Seong Jo] 
Are all the contents of the letter true?

98
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:56,131
There seemed to be a conflict among the traitors.

99
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:59,380
Minister Hong Man Ho atoned for his sin by dying.

100
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,951
He wrote a letter and committed sucide as a punishment for his crime.

101
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,855
I'm guilty.

102
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:14,180
It is because I didn't do my best. I missed the opportunity to catch all the traitors.

103
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,400
Your Majesty, please mete out my punishment.

104
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Your Majesty.

105
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Show respect for the Chief Shaman from the Hall of Royal Shamans!

106
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,900
Chief Shaman...

107
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:53,534
Tell me everything you know about that talisman.

108
00:13:53,534 --> 00:14:00,775
This talisman will enhance the sun's power.

109
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:03,090
Are you sure?

110
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,446
In front of Your Majesty, how would I dare to utter an untruth.

111
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,143
This talisman will certainly strengthen the sun's power.

112
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:14,702
Tell us also to whom it belongs!

113
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:20,270
It is a talisman made by the shaman Ari from the Royal Office of Shamans.

114
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,565
It is assuredly that child's creation.

115
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Where is this shaman named Ari?

116
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,300
They say she is fleeing.

117
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,042
Make sure you arrest that shaman.

118
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:54,275
What is going on?

119
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,396
Why is it so noisy?

120
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,887
Th-th-there, a person!

121
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:02,203
No...a body. N-no a person!

122
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:04,227
Let me down.

123
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:17,051
The baby will be shocked madam.

124
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:19,143
Please, go back into the palanquin!

125
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:22,022
A person is dying, how can I ignore that?

126
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,966
Are you coming to your senses?

127
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:34,574
I will clear...

128
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:36,066
your name...

129
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:38,456
This won't do! Put her inside now!

130
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,459
Huh?

131
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,111
How could we put a person in the palanquin without knowing her identity...?

132
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:46,916
Look here, I need your assistance!

133
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,494
Halt!

134
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:04,931
What seems to be the problem?

135
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,842
We are looking for a fugitive who is wanted for high treason.

136
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,938
I need you to open the palanquin.                                   A person who committed high treason?

137
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,342
It can't be done.

138
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:19,947
How can you look through a palanquin with a lady in there?

139
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,075
Ah!

140
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:28,504
Is there a problem?

141
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,595
Why have you prevented us from going?

142
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,161
We are looking for a fugitive wanted for high treason.

143
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:36,930
Please come out.

144
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:45,706
I am on my way to offer devotions for my soon to be born infant.

145
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:51,946
It is a bit uncomfortable for me to get out, but if you still harbor any suspicion, you may follow me to my house.

146
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:56,046
What will you do?

147
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,953
Will you go together with me?

148
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:01,922
I am deeply sorry.

149
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,927
Let us go.

150
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:17,037
Stop!

151
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,012
You are going to have to step out...

152
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,549
Oh my!!

153
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,500
Blood! Blood! Blood is visible!

154
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:35,055
The doctor said to be careful too!

155
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,458
Please, allow us to be on our way!

156
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,060
If we don't go, something terrible could happen!

157
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,231
It is the Chief Scholar's child!

158
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:45,966
If something goes amiss, will you accept responsibility?

159
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,600
Clear the way!

160
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:49,370
Clear the way!

161
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,205
Go! Go! We must hurry!

162
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:55,307
Madam! Please wait a bit longer!

163
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:03,785
I don't know how I can repay this kindness.

164
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:09,390
Because of me, this lowly thing, you ruined your beautiful garment and lied about starting labor.

165
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,492
It wasn't a lie.

166
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:15,029
I really felt like I was dying earlier.

167
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:22,500
Not I, but this child saved you.

168
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:28,042
The girl is as radiant as the moon.

169
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:34,048
Then, this baby is female?

170
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
And so it is.

171
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,753
You said you are a shaman, so it must be true.

172
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:42,022
I have been wishing for a daughter.

173
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,225
Is the baby really a girl?

174
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:46,928
Yes, it is.

175
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:50,931
A girl born with an honorable fate....

176
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:19,694
Is something wrong?

177
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,264
No, it's nothing.

178
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:25,333
I just got a little dizzy...

179
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,603
Will you be all right by yourself in this condition?

180
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:32,440
Please do not worry about me.

181
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,476
The kindness you have bestowed upon me

182
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:38,513
will not be forgetten even if I die.

183
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:43,117
I'm no shaman, but I can judge character.

184
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:47,656
You are not a bad person.

185
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,210
Madam!

186
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:13,306
I will protect your child no matter what, even if I die.

187
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Stop.

188
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:38,350
Who commanded you to make this?

189
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:44,238
I have no knowledge of that talisman.

190
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:50,596
It's still not too late.  If you are honest, your body will be intact for burial.

191
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:55,417
I did not write that talisman,

192
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,870
So how could there be 
someone to command me to do it?

193
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,824
There is incontrovertible evidence of your abetting the traitor!

194
00:22:01,824 --> 00:22:05,005
Will you continue to deny it to the end?

195
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:10,378
Did you just say traitor?

196
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:13,358
Evidence you say?

197
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:18,848
If you aren't a traitor by fabricating this false accusation, then who could be the traitor?

198
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,980
How dare you lie!

199
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,317
Will you not believe it until you see it, you low wench?

200
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:27,078
You scoundrel!

201
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:31,214
Do you think I am the only one who witnessed it?

202
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:34,894
Do you think that if you get rid of me, it is the end?

203
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:36,782
Wrong, you prevaricating knave.

204
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:39,528
The moon in the heavens was watching you.

205
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:43,282
That person's blood isn't the only thing which drenched your sword blade that night.

206
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:46,639
There is also the moonlight from that night.

207
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:48,537
Wait and see!

208
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:52,938
Some day the moonlight will reveal all your deeds.

209
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:59,018
One day that moonlight will end your life!

210
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:00,320
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING?

211
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,660
What are doing that you're all distracted?
Resume the torture quickly!

212
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,089
Yes!

213
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,700
Just for a short moment.

214
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:29,305
If anyone discovers this,

215
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:33,937
our heads will roll.

216
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,400
Ari...

217
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,376
Ari...

218
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:00,814
Ari!

219
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:05,664
How can you.

220
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:09,070
How can you be such a fool?

221
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,474
What did I say? I told you there was no hope if you went!

222
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:21,472
I never hoped that he would ascend to the throne.

223
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:26,585
That person thought the same.

224
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:31,044
I know. How can I not know your innocence?

225
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:33,006
Then that's enough.

226
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,588
If you know the truth, that's enough for me.

227
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:38,084
What do you mean that's enough?

228
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:41,497
I know and I couldn't do a thing about it!

229
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:45,091
Neither can I save my friend from being unjustly accused!

230
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:47,214
Do not shed tears for me.

231
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:51,310
All of this...

232
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,529
...is heaven's will.

233
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,336
What's the use of this fatalism?

234
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:59,652
Who cares about the heavens!

235
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:03,643
It would be better to tell everthing to His Majesty.

236
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:06,030
And you and I-

237
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:13,086
There is a child you must protect in my stead.

238
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:19,392
Although getting close to the sun will cause devastation to her family,

239
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:26,000
The child is one whose fate is to protect the sun.

240
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,552
You must protect and keep the child safe.

241
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:35,308
What are you talking about?

242
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:37,668
Look here!

243
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:39,140
Quickly come out.

244
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,705
Who is the child I need to protect?

245
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,769
I am not long for this world.

246
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:50,809
You must survive and protect the Office of the Royal Shamans.

247
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,260
Who exactly is this child?

248
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,645
Look here!

249
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:56,404
Let's go.

250
00:25:56,404 --> 00:26:00,010
Ari!

251
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,592
Quickly go!

252
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,100
Two suns and...

253
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,246
...one moon.

254
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:08,600
I pray you three will survive what is to come.

255
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,750
She really is as beautiful as the moon.

256
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,308
Yeom, isn't your little sister really pretty in your eyes?

257
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:51,940
Yes, she's really pretty.

258
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:59,919
Child, your name is Yeon Woo, Heo Yeon Woo.

259
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,590
Your father gave it to you

260
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,918
before he was sent as an envoy to China.

261
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:09,896
Do you like it?

262
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:35,088
There's a child you have to protect for me.

263
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:56,878

264
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:39,352
You're here.

265
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:44,224
Where did the red parasol and the box that was here go?

266
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:50,330
Madam, the honey fruit that was on the table has disappeared.

267
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,300
Have you seen the garments which were put here?

268
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,300
Crown Prince, Your Highness, it is time.

269
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,400
A lot of time has already passed.

270
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,025
Please quickly don ...

271
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,400
Hidden Moon Building

272
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:39,630
Yeon Woo!
Yeon Woo!

273
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,830
Why are you not coming out?

274
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:45,326
Oh my...

275
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,929
You don't get motion sickness?

276
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,600
Make haste.

277
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:53,949
or you will miss your brother's good show.

278
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,171
Minister of the Interior Yoon Dae Hyeong.

279
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:53,911
Office of Special Advisors, Chief Scholar, Heo Yeong Jae.

Subtitles brought to you by the Eclipse Team @ viki.com

281
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:30,457
Yeon Woo.

282
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:31,907
Look over there.

283
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:34,868
Your older brother is right there.

284
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:42,305
Although he isn't as good as my son,
 Woon also has great looks.

285
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:43,797
By Woon you mean?

286
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:47,374
That's right. You must have never met him.

287
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:51,534
That person over there is called Woon.

288
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:56,846
Along with Putera Yang Myung, he was taught by your father.

289
00:33:56,846 --> 00:34:01,995
They are your brother's closest friends.
 You know that, right?

290
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:08,368
The top students in literature and military strategy, they all studied under your father.

291
00:34:08,368 --> 00:34:11,609
It looks like a great feast must have been prepared this time.

292
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,982
It looks like the valley will be empty again.

293
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:32,601
He was still here an hour ago, he must still be in the palace.

294
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:35,673
If the King finds out about this, both you and I-

295
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,294
will suffer dire consequences.

296
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:38,232
Move quickly!

297
00:34:38,232 --> 00:34:38,966
At once!

298
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:40,310
Yes!

299
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:47,071
His Majesty is here!

300
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:51,119
Start the music!

301
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:22,914
Bow down and pay your respects!

302
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,700
I can't ruin my complexion.

303
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:35,459
Top Literacy Student Heo Yeom

304
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,218
and Top Military Student Kim Jae Woon,

305
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:40,153
come foward.

306
00:36:40,153 --> 00:36:41,959
Second place Kim Sae Min

307
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,724
and third place, Im Byeong Wook,

308
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:46,009
come forward.

309
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:11,086
Just look at your father.

310
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:13,453
He looks so happy.

311
00:37:13,453 --> 00:37:14,500
Look.

312
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,800
Do you see how the ends of his lips are pointing down?

313
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:23,396
That's the expression he has whenever he forces himself not to smile.

314
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:56,500
From what you are wearing, you don't look like a palace maid. Why are you in the palace?

315
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:04,803
As for you, why are you climbing the wall?

316
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,500
I will be asking the questions.

317
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,200
Are you unable to answer?

318
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,000
Don't you know that breaking a palace rule is a major crime?

319
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:24,216
I'm here for my brother's ceremony, he is getting an award for Top Military Scholar.

320
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:27,623
And how am I supposed to believe that?

321
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:30,119
Believing it or not is up to you.

322
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,371
But I can't stand someone stealing things from the palace.

323
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:38,028
I should be calling the guards right now.

324
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:45,888
Palace guards, to say I stole something from the palace?

325
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:53,863
I was simply searching for a way out.

326
00:40:53,863 --> 00:40:58,082
I also came to see my brother get the Top Literacy Award.

327
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,600
No...

328
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,500
I came to see my brother get the Top Military Award.

329
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:16,084
This is... that is.. His Majesty bestowed it upon my brother.

330
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:18,531
Over here! A thief is in the palace!

331
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:20,655
Here in the Hidden Moon Building!

332
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:22,942
Who's there?!

333
00:41:29,347 --> 00:42:09,688
Subtitles brought to you by the Eclipse Team @ viki.com

334
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,047
This is because of you!

335
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:17,512
If it weren't for you, there would be no need to run this far!

336
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:20,888
Did you just tell me to follow you in informal language?

337
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,100
Isn't it obvious, as you must be younger than me.

338
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,500
How are you so sure that I am younger than you?

339
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,800
What is your age then?

340
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,410
Subtract 2 from your age.

341
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
That means you're barely 11 years of age.

342
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,652
So how...

343
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:38,723
So then you're 13 years old!

344
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,790
Look at that.

345
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,920
I'm two years older than you.

346
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,192
Where are you going?

347
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,578
Like I said before, I'm going to the palace guards and...

348
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:50,913
Didn't I already say?

349
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:52,562
I'm not a thief!

350
00:42:52,562 --> 00:42:54,549
I came to see my brother who came in top for the military exam.

351
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:59,039
How is it that whenever you open your mouth you blame others and come up with lies?!

352
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,091
The top military student is my brother's close friend.

353
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:07,043
That person doesn't have any younger siblings.

354
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:13,091
I-Is that so?

355
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,991
That person doesn't have younger siblings?

356
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,977
I understand.

357
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:26,126
I'll tell you everything.

358
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,699
What's the use of hiding things any longer?

359
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:39,328
I wanted to meet my hyung.

360
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:43,299
Do you now have an older brother who passed the military exam?

361
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:44,663
No.

362
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,701
Not at all.

363
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:58,280
My older brother...

364
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:04,686
...was born from a different womb.

365
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,998
More than anyone else I know, he is warm.

366
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:15,322
He is skilled in everything

367
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:18,833
but he is someone that cannot participate in the civil service exam.

368
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:21,478
He is an important member of the country,

369
00:44:21,478 --> 00:44:24,406
but he is someone that cannot advance in position.

370
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:29,592
He respects his father,

371
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:34,950
but he is someone that cannot receive his father's affection.

372
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,556
Though he receives love from many people,

373
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:45,126
he is someone that cannot do things in front of many people.

374
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:56,000
It is my fault that my brother has to live like that.

375
00:44:57,262 --> 00:45:03,011
Maybe he's afraid of his father's harsh glare, but it's been a long time since he's visited me.

376
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:09,054
And that is why I was personally going to go and visit him.

377
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,400
Has my explanation satisfied you?

378
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,376
Why are you blaming yourself?

379
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:17,556
What?

380
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:22,378
You being a legitimate child, and your brother being an illegitimate child...

381
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:25,667
It's not something you have decided by choice.

382
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:28,604
So why are you putting yourself at fault?

383
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:34,680
Before didn't you scold me for blaming others whenever I open my mouth?

384
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,913
A man of virtue, doesn't blame the heavens

385
00:45:37,913 --> 00:45:40,982
and people, is what I've been taught.

386
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,300
You've read Noneul?

387
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:50,968
Plus, a farmer doesn't blame the fields and a musician doesn't blame the instrument.

388
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:55,531
The problem is in the person that became the owner,

389
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:58,867
it is not in the object.

390
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:04,107
If your older brother is warm-hearted as you, Young Master,

391
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:10,712
then...I believe he doesn't blame you.

392
00:46:10,712 --> 00:46:16,752
Therefore, Young Master, don't blame yourself or others.

393
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,300
Truthfully, aren't policies about legitimacy something His Royal Majesty the King is supposed to determine?

394
00:46:28,363 --> 00:46:35,737
If it's something that prevents talented people from succeeding and breaks brothers apart
 then shouldn't it be fixed?

395
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:41,142
There are many parts of Joseon's laws that do not make sense.

396
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,300
Noblemen and slaves are all the same people but it's strange to place ranks.

397
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:53,100
And my father always says it's going against laws for women to read too much.

398
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:03,933
So the King isn't managing politics correctly,

399
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,734
is that what you mean?

400
00:47:07,402 --> 00:47:09,771
That's not it.

401
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:16,745
This time it looks like I should go to the palace guards.

402
00:47:16,745 --> 00:47:20,382
Please don't do that.

403
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:25,554
Then...what should I do?

404
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:32,593
Just..pretend you didn't hear my words earlier.

405
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:38,066
Then do you now understand that I'm not a thief?

406
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,201
No.

407
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:40,302
Why?

408
00:47:40,302 --> 00:47:41,803
What else is the problem?

409
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:45,646
Where did you get the items in your bag earlier?

410
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:46,675
They are mine.

411
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:48,143
Everything is mine.

412
00:47:48,143 --> 00:47:49,077
Are you done now?

413
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:52,014
They were all expensive items.

414
00:47:52,014 --> 00:47:55,784
How could you possibly have those kinds of things?

415
00:47:55,784 --> 00:47:58,120
I tolerated you because I thought you were cute.

416
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,689
But now you're out of line.

417
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,400
Are you showing me disrespect now?

418
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,900
I am this land Joseon's-

419
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,200
I am this land Joseon's-

420
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:23,044
eunuch.

421
00:48:31,987 --> 00:48:34,790
It's been over an hour since she's been missing.

422
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,927
She didn't go to her palanquin so she's definitely still in the palace.

423
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:41,396
Please find her for me.

424
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:42,998
Please find-

425
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,700
Please tell me.

426
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:51,972
How much are eunuchs paid that you're able to acquire such things?

427
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:55,944
Yeon Woo!

428
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:58,913
Mother!

429
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,000
Oh, my child!

430
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:13,695
Stay still. Just stay still.

431
00:49:13,695 --> 00:49:16,466
Where have you been?

432
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,568
Don't say a single thing.

433
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:21,436
Not a word.

434
00:49:21,436 --> 00:49:25,574
If you open your mouth, I'll make you have a hard time.

435
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:28,410
Excuse me!

436
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:33,982
I acknowledged my crimes, and handed myself over to the authorities.

437
00:49:33,982 --> 00:49:36,552
Are you now satisfied?

438
00:49:36,552 --> 00:49:40,122
Ah! The items I've stolen are all at the Hidden Moon Building

439
00:49:40,122 --> 00:49:42,125
so let's go there.

440
00:49:58,105 --> 00:49:59,641
Wait a second miss!

441
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:01,470
Wait a second!

442
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:07,834
I was told to give this to you.

443
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:08,836
By whom?

444
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:12,229
He said you'll know if I say "Hidden Moon Building Young Master."

445
00:50:13,102 --> 00:50:16,202
Ahh, you're talking about that eunuch.

446
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:18,990
But, what is this?

447
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:25,732
There are many things I want to say.

448
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:27,780
But I'm frustrated that I can't.

449
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:33,028
Tell her that the more I think about it, the more angry and wronged I feel.

450
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:38,822
If she's a smart child, then she'll understand what this means.

451
00:50:38,822 --> 00:50:42,486
Were there any other messages?

452
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:46,404
Tell her, to be careful at night from now on.

453
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,500
-was what he said.

454
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,800
He's worried about my safety at night. As expected...

455
00:50:52,804 --> 00:50:57,009
He wasn't a bad person afterall.

456
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:14,393
So what tempted you so to try and leave the palace?!

457
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:17,983
What does the palace lack that you keep attempting to leave the palace?!

458
00:51:17,983 --> 00:51:21,640
I just wanted to meet Yang Myung Hyungnim

459
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,106
and discuss our studies together.

460
00:51:24,106 --> 00:51:27,001
You should be discussing your studies with your teachers!

461
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,061
I'm sorry to say this but I

462
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:33,614
was never inspired by any of my classes and educators.

463
00:51:33,614 --> 00:51:34,788
What?

464
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:39,581
How can I break down walls when there is not even a single debate?

465
00:51:39,581 --> 00:51:44,516
How can I face the world when I'm never questioned?

466
00:51:44,516 --> 00:51:47,353
Those things that are impossible to be done here...

467
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:51,392
are possible when discussing with Hyungnim.

468
00:51:51,392 --> 00:51:55,437
So that is your excuse for climbing over the wall?!

469
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:59,290
Since both the front and back are blocked,

470
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,216
for a moment, I looked to my side.

471
00:52:02,216 --> 00:52:07,033
How did you all serve the Crown Prince to come to this point?!

472
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:15,000
Transfer all the educators, and until new educators are selected ___ should take over.

473
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:20,085
Crown Prince, from now on you will study into the night to compensate for the time you wasted.

474
00:52:20,085 --> 00:52:25,961
Plus you will not take part in trips to the temporary palace.

475
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,600
Queen Dowager, the Minister of the Interior is here.

476
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,933
Enter.

477
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,807
You asked for me?

478
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:51,508
Welcome.

479
00:52:55,014 --> 00:52:58,364
Isn't this a bonsai tree?

480
00:52:58,364 --> 00:53:03,648
These days I'm quite entertained in raising them.

481
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,866
What do you think?

482
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:11,300
The structure of the branches are gaiety and matured.

483
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:17,636
It's glorious, as if it's a pine tree growing in the desert.

484
00:53:17,636 --> 00:53:21,773
Do you know what the purpose of bonsai trees are?

485
00:53:21,773 --> 00:53:28,647
Isn't it about raising a small thing to your liking?

486
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:31,583
You're right.

487
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,426
But the thing about bonsai trees is

488
00:53:34,426 --> 00:53:36,200
that it's more difficult than you think.

489
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:44,062
If you miss the timing, it becomes quite difficult for you to arrange the structure you want.

490
00:53:45,582 --> 00:53:48,170
I heard the Crown Prince's education department faced some chaos.

491
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:52,217
It looks like there will be a large-scale acceptance of new officials.

492
00:53:52,217 --> 00:53:57,145
Our Crown Prince should meet a proper teacher this time though.

493
00:53:57,145 --> 00:53:59,392
I am quite worried.

494
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:02,544
What does a position in the Crown Prince's education department mean?

495
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,400
It's a position to "raise" the future power of this country.

496
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,824
I've already taken action.

497
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:16,361
For the Crown Prince, who will ascend the throne,

498
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:19,898
and for the future of this country,

499
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:23,000
our family's clan has a lot of work to do.

500
00:54:23,044 --> 00:54:28,918
Especially your responsibility is crucial.

501
00:54:33,212 --> 00:54:37,280
Please forgive the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.
[Jung Jeon Han]

502
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:44,078
He has no close friends, and he lives a life bombarded with responsibilities.

503
00:54:44,078 --> 00:54:47,833
Please allow Yang Myung to freely enter the palace.

504
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:51,748
You sent Yang Myung, who isn't even married yet, out of the palace very young

505
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:57,135
and don't even allow him to frequently enter the palace so Crown Prince grows more lonely...

506
00:54:57,135 --> 00:55:00,420
It's not a position that can be protected by childish actions.

507
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,709
All the previous kings went through the same thing and then came to the throne.

508
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:08,280
One who is to supposed to hold onto the people of this entire country, isn't able to 
keep his personal feelings in check

509
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,848
is something you want me to be understanding of?!

510
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,083
However, Your Majesty...

511
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:12,338
I must rest now.

512
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:14,685
Queen, return to your quarters.

513
00:55:14,685 --> 00:55:16,200
Is anyone outside?

514
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,641
Escort the Queen.

515
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:29,801
He commanded that no one be allowed in. 
 [Hee Bim (Royal Concubine) Maiden Name Park}

516
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:31,703
I am gravely sorry.

517
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,973
It is not your fault.

518
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:38,744
Is Yang Myung not even visiting to pay his respects these days?

519
00:55:38,744 --> 00:55:43,081
I heard that he left the city for a trip.

520
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:49,588
His Majesty's cold glare looks deadly, so he must not feel comfortable entering the palace.

521
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:54,126
When he returns tell him to visit my quarters to pay his respects.

522
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:58,964
It'd be even better if he visits the Crown Prince's quarters first.

523
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,800
Give me a good price.

524
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,610
I want to buy some presents for my friends.

525
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,345
I haven't seen you around before.

526
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:14,813
Are you a newcomer?

527
00:56:14,813 --> 00:56:16,750
I'm just passing through but

528
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:20,219
I just caught some game for fun.

529
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:22,321
Let's see here.

530
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,756
They're wild right?

531
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,224
Of course.

532
00:56:25,224 --> 00:56:29,294
It's real wild game that only ate morningdew high up in the mountains.

533
00:56:29,294 --> 00:56:30,929
Morning dew? Hahaha

534
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,897
Tisk!

535
00:56:31,897 --> 00:56:35,967
Pheasants don't live just on morning dew.

536
00:56:44,743 --> 00:56:47,912
What is that line for?

537
00:56:48,514 --> 00:56:54,186
A blind shaman child who can diagnose illnesses perfectly.

538
00:56:54,186 --> 00:57:01,537
On top of that, they sell amulet like rocks.
 Rumor has spread that it heals all illnesses. 
So everyone is lining up to buy one.

539
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:02,828
Heals all illnesses?

540
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:05,930
Yes, heals all illnesses.

541
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:12,571
I was in a dilemma about what to buy as presents...

542
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:14,807
..should I buy some of that?

543
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:21,313
Now, the child shaman whose powers surpasses the Hall of Royal Shamans' Chief Shaman,
 Nok Yeong's powers

544
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:26,318
The mysterious rock that heals all illnesses.

545
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,687
For one rock, only 5 nyangs (coins).

546
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:32,157
Now, there aren't many left so getting a waiting number.

547
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,092
Now! Now!

548
00:57:33,092 --> 00:57:36,228
Take one. Take one!

549
00:57:36,228 --> 00:57:39,063
There really aren't many left.

550
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:48,900
It's over there. They are the ones that are using a child and falsely making claims. [Jang Nok Young]

551
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:54,946
After starving and abusing the child, if it dies then they buy another one and continue business.

552
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Sometimes they even hand them over to brothels.

553
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,953
I need to go and see it for myself.

554
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:12,761
Now, numbers 41 to 45, enter!

555
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,637
Wait a second.

556
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,300
You must pick a number first.

557
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,800
I'm sorry, but I am before you.

558
00:58:45,264 --> 00:58:50,835
In Joseon's sky, two suns.

559
00:58:59,678 --> 00:59:05,617
There are evil auras around your shoulder, so you must feel aches.

560
00:59:05,617 --> 00:59:10,522
Soo goong! Soo goong!

561
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:15,093
Shaman Soo Goong is saying that there is bad energy on you.

562
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,063
It is a very vicious energy.

563
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:21,500
Two suns.

564
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,870
Use the mysterious rock. It's 20 nyangs (coins).

565
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:27,205
Thank you sir!

566
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:30,676
Hey, what are you here for?

567
00:59:31,877 --> 00:59:34,913
As for me,

568
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,100
I twisted my leg while hunting a boar.

569
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,056
Oh dear.

570
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,000
Next customer!

571
01:00:06,873 --> 01:00:11,453
You hurt your leg that's filled with the energy of a wild animal...

572
01:00:11,453 --> 01:00:16,090
Oh? I see a light in you sir!

573
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:20,291
A very beautiful golden color?

574
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:23,691
Or is it a red color?

575
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,185
A light?

576
01:00:25,185 --> 01:00:27,637
What kind of light are you talking about?

577
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:30,582
I'm hungry.

578
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:36,079
Soo Goong! Soo Goong! Soo Goong!

579
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:44,831
Shaman Soo Goong says that for your leg injury a level 4 rock will do.

580
01:00:44,831 --> 01:00:50,996
Though her body is frail, your stomach is bloated and makes a strange sound.

581
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:55,534
This is probably because her stomach is ruined and is the cause of her poor energy.

582
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:57,709
What is this punk saying?

583
01:00:57,709 --> 01:01:02,531
I'm sure it's because of starvation and exhaustion.

584
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:05,411
Do you want to be hit by the mysterious rock?

585
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,858
This bruise near her neck,

586
01:01:10,858 --> 01:01:14,735
These scars! How many injuries are there?

587
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:18,999
This wretch easily bruises.

588
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,000
Open your eyes.

589
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,200
This wretch!

590
01:01:40,254 --> 01:01:43,257
I'm hungry! Hungry!

591
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,000
They're con men!

592
01:02:06,702 --> 01:02:08,963
Please call for some guards.

593
01:02:21,827 --> 01:02:25,304
Ahjussi! You're running too fast, I'm getting dizzy!

594
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:27,587
That's because you've been so starved.

595
01:02:27,587 --> 01:02:28,612
Wait just a little longer

596
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:30,697
because I'll take you to a doctor.

597
01:02:30,697 --> 01:02:34,388
And! I'm not an ajusshi, kid!

598
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,300
Come here!

599
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,700
Ahjusshi!

600
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,211
Ahjusshi!

601
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:49,603
Ahjusshi!

602
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:52,454
I don't like it! I don't want to get hit!

603
01:02:52,454 --> 01:02:53,960
Be quiet!

604
01:02:57,284 --> 01:02:59,844
Let go of that child immediately!

605
01:02:59,844 --> 01:03:02,519
What is this?

606
01:03:03,704 --> 01:03:05,907
Move!

607
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:06,574
Move!

608
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,041
Move!

609
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,975
Catch him!

610
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:15,353
Let the kid go, alright?

611
01:03:15,353 --> 01:03:18,939
I'll send her to some restaurant and ask them to raise her well.

612
01:03:20,059 --> 01:03:24,106
Because of you, we lost our day's wages,

613
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:28,976
and we can no longer stay in this area.

614
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:32,976
Now do you know your wrongs?

615
01:03:38,206 --> 01:03:40,240
Don't get me angry

616
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,063
It will be very dangerous for you if I get angry.

617
01:03:42,063 --> 01:03:45,312
If I get angry, it will be even more dangerous!

618
01:03:47,082 --> 01:03:49,016
I'm warning you again

619
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:52,919
If you get me any angrier, it'll be really dangerous.

620
01:03:55,296 --> 01:04:01,028
Did I tell you that my martial arts teacher came in top place at this year's civil service exam?

621
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:04,498
If your martial arts teacher passed the civil service exam

622
01:04:04,498 --> 01:04:08,100
Then my father is the king, you punk!

623
01:04:32,893 --> 01:04:36,898
I know the king a little...

624
01:04:40,534 --> 01:04:44,478
And he's never mentioned a son like you.

625
01:04:58,885 --> 01:05:41,096
Subtitles brought to you by the Eclipse Team @ viki.com

626
01:05:44,498 --> 01:05:46,400
Your Majesty

627
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,303
I've returned safely from my trip.

628
01:05:50,303 --> 01:05:55,609
Please forgive me for paying my respects outside of the palace.

629
01:05:55,609 --> 01:06:01,046
Have you been well too, Crown Prince?

630
01:06:30,645 --> 01:06:33,214
I'm not going to run away

631
01:06:33,214 --> 01:06:35,483
so let's stop now.

632
01:07:03,944 --> 01:07:09,083
If I told you I was the crown prince, your nagging would probably increase.

633
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:14,989
But I'll probably never have the chance to meet you again anyway.

634
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:34,409
Ha Won Seo Bang

635
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:39,179
Meaning, if you draw it it will be round and if you write it will be straight.

636
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:41,616
I understand this one.

637
01:07:41,616 --> 01:07:43,517
Myo Saeng Yoo Sa?

638
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:47,221
The rabbit lives, and the rooster dies.

639
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:49,357
What could this mean?

640
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,992
Miss! It's Seol!

641
01:07:57,165 --> 01:08:00,300
You're still in the same position?

642
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:05,505
Seol, if the rabbit lives and the rooster dies, what would happen?

643
01:08:05,505 --> 01:08:10,110
If the rooster dies, then who will wake us up in the morning?

644
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:12,345
Just go to sleep now.

645
01:08:12,345 --> 01:08:15,949
Do you want to be scolded by your father again?

646
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:34,295
In the moonlight,

647
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:38,966
I hoped for maybe some hidden words would be revealed.

648
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:45,406
"If the rooster dies, who will wake us up in the morning?"

649
01:09:46,873 --> 01:09:51,878
Morning...
 Myo Shi: 5am to 7am

650
01:09:54,948 --> 01:09:56,984
Myo Saeng Yoo Sa

651
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:00,353
Born at Myo Shi (5am~7am) and die at Yoo Shi (5pm~7pm).

652
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:03,957
Myo Shi - 5am ~ 7am
Yoo Shi - 5pm ~ 7pm

653
01:10:03,957 --> 01:10:09,330
If you draw it is is round and when you write it is it straight.

654
01:10:11,298 --> 01:10:15,269
The thing that rises at Myo Shi and descends at Yoo Shi!

655
01:10:15,269 --> 01:10:18,639
The day, meaning the sun!

656
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:21,209
Are you showing disrespect to me right now?

657
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:23,510
I am this land Joseon's-

658
01:10:25,278 --> 01:10:27,914
Sun.

659
01:10:34,589 --> 01:10:39,559
Could it be? We might see each other again?

660
01:10:39,559 --> 01:10:43,430
Are you the Crown Prince?

661
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:50,604
You don't know how relieved I am that we won't ever see each other again.

662
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:55,342
It was good seeing you again, Heo Yeon Woo.
