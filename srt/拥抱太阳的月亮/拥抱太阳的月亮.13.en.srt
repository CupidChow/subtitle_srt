Episode 13

2
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:13,043
Regardless of whatever you say,

3
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:14,264
I . . .

4
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,493
am your woman.

5
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,371
As a matter of fact...

6
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:33,475
If the Queen cannot have my heart...

7
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:38,480
Then, of course, she would want to be
 the mother of the next king.

8
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:43,875
Fine.. 
 for the queen....

9
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,907
I'll take off my clothes just this one time.

10
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:32,973
You are really cruel.

11
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:36,195
I am a woman too.

12
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,973
Why....

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
can't you just treat me as a woman who longs for her husband.

14
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:11,181
Why are you like this again?

15
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Are you attempting to set us back to where we were the first time?

16
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,112
Your Majesty?

17
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,783
Your Majesty?

18
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
Your Majesty?

19
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:33,055
Your Majesty!

20
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,357
Is anyone out there?!

21
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:36,845
Your Majesty...

22
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,561
Your Majesty!!

23
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:42,264
Please wake up!

24
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,133
Hurry up and bring the Doctor!

25
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,420
Yes.

26
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,936
Your Majesty
Your Majesty!

27
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,406
Your Majesty!
Please wake up!

28
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,712
Thank You.

29
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,300
What do you mean?

30
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,381
Even though I'm a shaman, you treat me like a human,

31
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:07,822
and look at me as a woman.

32
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:10,859
Saying that you'll even give me your precious heart,

33
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,063
I'm very thankful.

34
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:19,668
"I'll help you escape from the shaman life..."

35
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,004
"I'll help you escape from your troubled environment..."

36
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,973
For those words,

37
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,008
I am thankful and,

38
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:28,610
Thankful again.

39
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,047
I didn't open my lips and utter those difficult things to hear you say this.

40
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:35,417
Even though I am thankful,

41
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:40,288
I can't lie and say I have feelings for you.

42
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:45,560
Your compassionate heart for me...

43
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:48,663
Please let me accept it thankfully.

44
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,266
By any chance,

45
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:56,704
Is there someone in your heart already?

46
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,508
A lowly shaman, like me...

47
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,100
couldn't harbor someone in her heart.

48
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,314
Aren't shamans people too?

49
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,515
A shaman...

50
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,385
is just a vessel for the gods.

51
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:12,988
We cannot keep something else in our heart.

52
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:20,528
Then, are you saying that nothing can move your heart?

53
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:23,665
Unni!

54
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,302
There's trouble, Unni!

55
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:29,505
His Majesty has collapsed!

56
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:33,307
They've asked you to quickly go to his room!

57
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,149
Just a vessel for the gods.

58
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,719
You say

59
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,755
 you can't harbor anything or anyone in your heart?

60
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,800
Then,

61
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,961
you shouldn't have been caught having feelings for someone else.

62
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,321
You wench!

63
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:22,458
During the entire consummation process...

64
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,827
I commanded you to protect against sudden mishaps...

65
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:28,463
Where in the world have you been? 
 And why didn't you get here sooner?

66
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,101
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

67
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:23,412
Were you worried?

68
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:32,453
I was worried.

69
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:37,592
What has made you so worried?

70
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:39,894
Everything...

71
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:45,366
Everything made me worry.

72
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,445
Were you worried that I..

73
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:57,011
would put a different woman in my heart?

74
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,814
How can your servant...

75
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,585
Until the morning..

76
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:08,356
can you stay by my side?

77
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:14,895
If you're by my side, protecting me..

78
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:18,566
I believe that I can sleep peacefully.

79
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,369
If it is your wish, then..

80
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:24,973
I will do that.

81
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,500
Hurry up and admit your error!

82
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:01,809
Wasn't there a problem in forcing the Consummation Day earlier?

83
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,044
No!

84
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:06,648
According to our reading, there was no problem!

85
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:11,453
Unless...
...the Royal Doctor missed something.

86
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:13,573
What?!

87
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:15,000
What are you trying to say?

88
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,700
Are you conspiring against me?

89
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,031
I can stake my life and say this. 
 Before the Consummation Ceremony,
 there was nothing wrong with his majesty.

90
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:27,100
If there was nothing wrong with the ordained date,

91
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,771
and if his health was all the more robust,

92
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:31,400
then why did the King

93
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,241
suddenly faint?

94
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:38,079
That is what's frustrating us as well!

95
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,284
But last night 
 there was this weird presence.

96
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:45,353
Weird?

97
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,355
What are you tallking about?

98
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,200
That is..

99
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,631
During the night, I suddenly felt the spirits being disturbed.

100
00:10:56,631 --> 00:11:01,800
Something penetrated into the Palace.

101
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:06,041
The stable environment became disheveled

102
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,300
and his majesty, who was healthy, fainted.

103
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,900
Perhaps...

104
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,500
If you will permit this servant to speak.

105
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,100
This is definitely someone

106
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,523
trying to harm his majesty

107
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:25,326
by sending deadly vibes.

108
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:37,672
Have you arrived, Your Highnesses?

109
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:39,808
Did you just meet the King?

110
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:45,013
Yes.  When I heard that he was getting better,
 I couldn't stay put.

111
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,180
All right.

112
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,000
How is he doing?

113
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,500
According to the doctor, his pulse and blood circulation is normal again. But,

114
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,858
because he is worried that something 
could go wrong, he prescribed further rest.

115
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:59,127
Thankfully it isn't that bad.

116
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:02,463
The heavens have helped us.

117
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:03,800
I'm sorry, but

118
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:09,771
the King has just drunk the tonic that the 
doctor decocted and has fallen asleep.

119
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,041
I was so surprised.  Just imagine

120
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,578
how much more surprised the Queen was.

121
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:18,947
I was also worried about the Queen.

122
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,800
So, I was headed to her palace.

123
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,300
Then, let's go together.

124
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,363
How greatly you must have been suprised.

125
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:38,499
Your face has become so thin overnight.

126
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,993
I . . .

127
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,439
have no right to see the two of you.

128
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,900
Please don't forgive me.

129
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,700
Nonsense.

130
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,511
How is this your fault?

131
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:53,414
No, Mother.

132
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,150
This is all my fault.

133
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,400
If I had told you before...

134
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,700
What do you mean?

135
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:03,992
The truth is..

136
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:10,412
I didn't want to worry you both.  
So, I didn't say anything.  But,

137
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,567
the day before the consummation,

138
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,212
I had an ominous dream.

139
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,757
An ominous dream?

140
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:22,377
A young girl wearing white told me,

141
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,800
"From now on, the one protecting the King
 should be me,

142
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,900
so you will never be able to

143
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,400
produce an heir to the throne."

144
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,892
How can that-

145
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,700
How can you dream of such an ominous dream?

146
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,864
I didn't want to tell you.  But,

147
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:48,369
the talisman has used her power to hypnotize the King

148
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,300
and is receiving all his attentions.

149
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,200
I think this is happening because of this rumor.

150
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:56,578
If it's about that, 
I told you not to worry.

151
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,748
The King does not even know about her existence.

152
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:03,351
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.  But,

153
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,621
the King

154
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:12,793
is already aware of the fact

155
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,897
that she comes every night.

156
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,305
A shaman who absorbs bad energy?

157
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:28,513
Such special shamans exist?

158
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,800
If I had known beforehand, I would've brought one myself...

159
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,100
Would the Madam (his wife) allow that?

160
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:42,390
The moment she finds out, 
your life would be forfeited.

161
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,843
But,

162
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:51,166
how did you know about the shaman sending deadly vibes to the King?

163
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,200
Ahh, it was fabricated?

164
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Then . . .

165
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Who in truth sent the deadly vibes?

166
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,482
Why would the truth be so important?

167
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:12,387
What's important is using this situation to our advantage.

168
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:18,727
It's known that the bad energy absorbing shaman was secretly entering the King's chambers.

169
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:23,696
But if word gets out that he knew about her coming, and kept her by his side . . .

170
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,000
To the Confucian scholars . . .

171
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,100
The scholars wouldn't stand it.

172
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:32,741
The King won't accept this fact easily.

173
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:34,909
What do we have to lose?

174
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:37,011
If the King slowly accepts this fact,

175
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:42,217
we'll be able to pursue our interests as we please.

176
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:45,840
If he doesn't accept the fact,

177
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,124
the truth about the shaman in the King's chambers become known,

178
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,900
it'll leave him scarred.

179
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,800
That's right!
That's right!

180
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,100
First we should splash a lot of muddy water on him.

181
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,700
Or not.

182
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,200
This is what makes politics so interesting.

183
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,546
If we consider the situation differently,
first of all,

184
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:15,700
the King has fallen in love with this shaman.

185
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
Second,

186
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,600
The shaman who has fallen in love with the King 
has cursed the consummation.

187
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,200
Would this story work?

188
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,100
That head of yours.

189
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,832
works pretty fast.

190
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,768
Then . . .

191
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:35,904
What should we prepare?

192
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,100
First of all,

193
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,175
to that shaman girl,

194
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:44,245
we should tell her exactly

195
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:48,182
what she should say in order to survive.

196

197
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,599
Isn't it really strange?

198
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,215
Why do you think something strange always happens when he's with the Queen?

199
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:09,571
Didn't you hear?

200
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:13,000
It's because the King didn't forget his first love.

201
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
That's why he avoids the Queen's chamber, they say.

202
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,100
That's just what they're saying.

203
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,700
How can a man, who lives in a flower bed,
sustain eight years without losing his virginity.

204
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:25,186
Does that make sense?

205
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:27,956
I think the rumors are true.

206
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:29,791
What rumors?

207
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,400
It's not that the King is avoiding consumation, but the spirit of the former Crown Princess interfering.

208
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:46,200
Even to this day, you can hear a girl crying 
at the Hidden Moon Pavillion at night.

209
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Then,

210
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,845
Is that the dead Princess' cry?

211
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:53,700
What would make her cry like that?

212
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,600
How am I suppose to know all of that?

213
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Anyway, since the healthy princess
died suddenly, they were saying 
it was a murder or

214
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,300
something like that for a while.

215
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,900
So there was no evidence of murder.

216
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:16,671
That's right.

217
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:20,208
What about poison?

218
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:24,078
That wasn't it, either.

219
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,313
Then,

220
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,700
What was her condition like?

221
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you remember?

222
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Ahh, that...

223
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:35,290
Her pulse was normal and the same for all her five organs,

224
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,096
I remember clearly because it was
my first time seeing those kind of symptoms,
in 30 years of practicing medicine.

225
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:42,430
Ah but,

226
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,434
Are you really a relative of that person's?

227
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Yes.

228
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,300
Ahh, that's strange.

229
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,700
Her relative are all good looking.

230
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,700
So, do you remember anything else?

231
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,500
Well...

232
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,000
it's just that I felt bad for her parents every time.

233
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,800
I went because I was called and her father was saying she was alive even when she was clearly dead.

234
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:17,098
He was begging to check her pulse again.

235
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,200
That's not all. 
Her father was hugging her tightly even after she died.

236
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,700
It had been a long time since she died,

237
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:30,645
but her corpse was warm,
as if she were still alive.

238
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:35,580
Even talking about it makes me sad.

239
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,100
I'm fine.

240
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Since we are out and about, 
we should get you some medicine.

241
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,900
No.
You should be first.

242
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,083
So that you can have a son 
who looks exactly like his father.

243
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,621
If it's that kind of medicine,
I'll eat it as much as a hundred times.

244
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:18,193
No matter how bitter it tastes, 
I will gladly take it.

245

 Subtitles brought to you by The 'Eclipse' Team @ Viki.com

246
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:31,573
By any chance, do you have it?

247
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:34,375
What are you looking for?

248
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,411
Just listen.

249
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:40,400
I heard about the medicine that helps you make boys.

250
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Ahh, yes.
There is.

251
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,525
I will pay as much as you want. 
So just bring them over to my place when you bring the other medicines.

252
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:51,726
Yes.

253
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,400
Mother, what are you doing?

254
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:02,470
Are you looking at that again?

255
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,341
A few days before she was called in,

256
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:10,545
I came here with Yeon Woo.

257
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:14,082
The place where we measured her height was

258
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:15,868
here.

259
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,920
If she were alive,

260
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,709
how much more would she have grown?

261
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,900
A few minutes ago,
a man came and

262
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,864
asked about her.

263
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,504
He asked about Yeon Woo?

264
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:36,838
Who was he?

265
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:41,375
He said he was a distant relative.

266
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:55,390
Eun Wol Gak. [Hidden Moon Pavillion]

267
00:21:57,893 --> 00:21:59,894
Crown Princess.

268
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:01,708
Crown Princess?

269
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:05,700
Lady Heo.

270
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,073
Yeon Woo.

271
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,109
Heo Yeon Woo?

272
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,154
Heo Yeon Woo?

273
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:18,579
Heo Yeon Woo.
Heo...Yeon Woo?

274
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:22,318
Yeon Woo.

275
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,800
Yeon Woo.
Yeon Woo!

276
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,455
Yeon Woo.

277
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:28,323
Yeon Woo.
Yeon Woo.

278
00:22:28,323 --> 00:22:31,905
Yeon Woo!
Yeon Woo!

279
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:37,397
Shaman Wol, come out and obey your order!

280
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,400
Are you the Shaman Wol?

281
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,808
That's right.  But,

282
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:48,376
who are you?

283
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,000
Me?

284
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,600
I am Inspector Hong. Gyu. Tae.

285
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,800
Arrest her!

286
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,900
Yes.

287
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,900
Why are you like this?

288
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,400
What is the reason you are like this?

289
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,896
[Korean Folk Village Location]

290
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,507
Miss!

291
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,900
What's going on?!

292
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,300
Why are you arresting her when she is innocent?

293
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
Move aside!

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,617
The Shaman Wol,
is known for high treason.

295
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:32,253
Our Miss, for high treason?

296
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:34,489
You must have gotten something wrong...

297
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,800
If she didn't do anything wrong, 
then the police will find that out.

298
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,928
What are you doing?

299
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:42,063
Hurry up and take her.

300
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,342
Jan Shil, I'm going to follow her.  So,

301
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:58,246
you hurry and inform Spirit Mother.  Understand?

302
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,682
What should I do?

303
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:03,564
Spirit Mother went out earlier.

304
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:06,120
What should I do, Spririt Mother?

305
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,056
What should I do?

306
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:10,721
How could you do such a reckless thing?

307
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:14,596
Are you determined to see blood?

308
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,000
Until the rightful owner returns,

309
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,236
we must stop them no matter what.

310
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:23,305
It was a destiny that could be broken.

311
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:25,578
It was a destiny that wasn't supposed to be broken!

312
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,818
If you lose this chance,

313
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:31,413
the possiblity of everything returning to its rightful place

314
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:33,900
will be lost forever.

315
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
It's already a destiny that is lost.

316
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,500
The moment I was no longer a palace servant,

317
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,824
it was already

318
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,800
something that couldn't be put back into place again!

319
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,663
But wasn't that

320
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:52,233
also to save her?

321
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:55,757
If Ari had not asked me to,

322
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:57,872
I would have killed her.

323
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,775
I know that isn't the truth.

324
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,200
That was the choice of saving
her and the Seongsucheong.

325
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,900
How would I not know that?

326
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,654
To protect the Seongsucheong?

327
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:17,191
Although it was a factor,

328
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:18,960
it wasn't the main reason.

329
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,100
Look here, Miss Jang.

330
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,500
Anyway, it was only due to the Great Queen Dowager's mercy

331
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:29,237
that I was barely able to obtain the Seongsucheong.

332
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,906
Forgetting the civilians and the heavens,

333
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,708
the Seongsucheong submitted to the imperial family.

334
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:38,346
From then on, when we degraded from being an authority to a political tool,

335
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:43,550
the fate of the Seongsucheong was already sealed and doomed.

336
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,420
Even if we do disappear . . .

337
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,824
Just so that it doesn't occur 
while I am still in charge,

338
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,094
that is why I went against the Spirit's will.

339
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,797
So shouldn't you put everything in their rightful place?

340
00:25:55,797 --> 00:25:58,832
To put everything back in its place,

341
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:00,802
we've...

342
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:04,705
We've come too far.

343
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,276
Don't you know?

344
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,147
The collapse.

345
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:16,300
It has already started!

346
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:20,788
Denying Gang Sung Gan's rule,

347
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,430
what was the reason for not showing up
 to protect him?

348
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,336
Didn't I already tell you?

349
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,697
It was a command.

350
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:32,867
But,

351
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,100
where were you?

352
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,900
Did I not already tell you that I was at the Seongsucheong?

353
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,108
Do you have a witness to confirm your alibi?

354
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,413
That . . .

355
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:45,485
 It can't be me?

356
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:49,349
Please go back.

357
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:54,930
I was alone.

358
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,000
Then, there is no evidence to prove your innocence!

359
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,934
Why don't you release your hand
and talk.

360
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,369
You rude...!

361
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,700
Stop.

362
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,309
Prime Minister.

363
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,812
I have something to say to her,

364
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,381
so please leave for a moment.

365
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:34,204
Did you just say
high treason?

366
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:35,768
Yes.

367
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:42,302
They said she was responsible for shady activity against the Queen.

368
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,200
The crime for hurting the King's body

369
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,000
is a big crime.

370
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,058
I have never tried to commit such crime.

371
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,361
It seems like you don't understand me.

372
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:13,934
There was an aura that came to hurt his body from somewhere.

373
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:17,505
Someone has to pay for that sin.

374
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:22,944
That is . . . Whoever . . .

375
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,679
that person is.

376
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,885
Once you go out of  this  interrogation room,

377
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:33,821
until you confess your sins,

378
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:37,192
you will have to endure hard torture.

379
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:38,794
Your blood and skin will come off.

380
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,100
Your bones will probably be crushed.

381
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,012
You will probably ask them to just kill you.

382
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:46,534
You'll beg them.

383
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,705
However,

384
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:53,208
depending on your answer,

385
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,677
the outcome may be different.

386
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:58,813
You can avoid all of this.

387
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:03,618
I can help you walk out of here with both your legs.

388
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,688
What kind of...

389
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,857
answer...

390
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:12,193
do you want from me?

391
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:16,864
It looks like you understand me now.

392
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,768
While you were visiting his room at night,

393
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,505
I heard that, secretly,

394
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:25,200
you shared intimate moments with him.

395
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
That is wrong!

396
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
How can I do that with the King?

397
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,200
That isn't the right answer.

398
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,584
In order for you to receive all his attentions,

399
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:37,986
you didn't show up in his room on that night,

400
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:43,124
and prayed to cast a killing aura stopping the consummation.

401
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:47,096
Is that correct?

402
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:50,000
I will never

403
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,200
speak any false accusations.

404
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
That isn't the right answer either.

405
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,939
What are you going to do?

406
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,608
After your cruel interrogations,

407
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:03,245
would you still want to be punished 
from limb to limb?

408
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:09,083
Or, will you truthfully admit your relationship with the King

409
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,319
and walk away with

410
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,321
a smaller punishment?

413
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,618
Ahjumma!

414
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,300
Why are you just coming now?

415
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,698
What happened?

416
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:37,761
She's being interrogated right now, so we can't see her.

417
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:39,609
They'll let us see her after they finish.

418
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
I'll be here, so you can leave.

419
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,595
I don't want to.
I can't leave here unless I see her face.

420
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:47,989
Hurry!
Don't you hear me?

421
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:03,438
She looks familiar.

422
00:31:03,438 --> 00:31:06,561
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere.

423
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:46,690
Spirit Mother.

424
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,951
Your body...

425
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:51,469
Is it okay?

426
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,000
It's still fine.

427
00:31:55,181 --> 00:32:00,329
 Why is it that you must go through so many hard situations?

428
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:04,799
More importantly, how is the King?

429
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,400
Before I left, I saw that his health was back to normal,

430
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,709
but, perhaps, he is not well anymore.

431
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,700
How  can you worry about that when

432
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,200
your life is at stake!

433
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,761
Don't you know the severity of your crime?

434
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:21,187
I know.

435
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,300
I also know that it is not important whether I am innocent or guilty.

436
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,800
This lowly shaman . . .

437
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:33,425
knows that there is no more unfortunate position than being a shaman to be used for political plots.

438
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:36,006
I know very well.

439
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:39,874
Regardless, I won't be able to leave here.

440
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,367
Just.

441
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:42,769
Just?

442
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:44,433
What is it?

443
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:46,894
Because of me,

444
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,500
the King has been put into an unfortunate situation!

445
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm sure they will use my being in the palace as a reason

446
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:56,919
to ruin his position and weaken his authority.

447
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,300
For someone in your position,

448
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
who are you worrying about?

449
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,700
In order to not be a hinderance to the King,

450
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,300
please think of a way with me.

451
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,100
So I don't become a burden to His Majesty,

452
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,000
just say that I'm a spy someone sent to harm him, something like that.

453
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,100
Are you in the right mind?

454
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:15,736
Then . . .

455
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:17,747
Are you going to speak a lie?

456
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:20,107
If there's no way to prove my innocence,

457
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:23,000
isn't it better to be able to help the King?

458
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,500
That doesn't make sense!
Don't say that!

459
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:28,749
Even though you're innocent, if you take the blame
 and are punished,

460
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:32,269
do you think the King will be happy?

461
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,000
That's right.

462
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,400
That'll remain just as big a scar.

463
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,500
He'll be in pain.

464
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:54,375
Since a lowly shaman is still a part 
of the King's nation,

465
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:58,145
he will think he wasn't able to protect me.

466
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:02,891
He'll blame himself.

467
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,700
Then . . .
Then, what should I do?

468
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,818
How can I protect

469
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:13,528
the King and me?

470
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:28,589
This medicine will bring back your health.

471
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,700
Now, you don't have to worry.  But,

472
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:39,587
you still have to be careful.

473
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:53,890
What's wrong?

474
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,681
That is...

475
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,245
That is...

476
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:02,109
Didn't I ask you what's wrong?

477
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,800
The Shaman, Wol . . .

478
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,900
For a crime,

479
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
has been put into prison

480
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,300
and is awaiting the death sentence.

481
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:18,773
Should I bring that one or the other one?

482
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,400
It's troublesome if I carry too many things.

483
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,500
If I go to a banquet in the provincial offices,  
I need more presentable clothing.

484
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
That's right.

485
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,640
Get the banquet clothes made by craftsman Kim Dong Su.

486
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,113
And the matching shoes, bring the silk shoes carefully made by the embroiderer Master Park.

487
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,951
Get that for me as well

488
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:44,485
Did something bad happen?

489
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:46,287
Why do you think like that?

490
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,300
I'm saying that because
you're leaving on a journey so suddenly.

491
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,200
Staying home for too long has caused my body to become restless.

492
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:57,250
For me anyway,

493
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:02,136
the lifestyle of flowing like the wind and water fits me.

494
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,300
I will go to Yeongnam and 
meet up with the Prince Consort.

495
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,500
Please come back as fast as you can.

496
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:11,479
If you go out for too long,
everyone will worry.

497
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,514
Dang this popularity.

498
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:17,111
Right, go get the bamboo pot.

499
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:21,101
Cooking meat in it is the best.

500
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Jan Shil, why are you here?

501
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
Orabeoni,

502
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,746
There's trouble.

503
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,600
Wol Unni.
Wol Unni...

504
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,100
I'm sorry, but,

505
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,953
I'm about to go on a journey.

506
00:36:50,953 --> 00:36:53,826
Because of a crime, she's been taken to jail!

507
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:56,557
Orabeoni, can't you help?

508
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,900
Orabeoni, just once!
Just this time!

509
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,300
That has...

510
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:09,003
Nothing to do with me.

511
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,700
What should I do now?

512
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,600
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before...

513
00:37:57,618 --> 00:37:59,487
For sure...

514
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:02,323
That girl...

515
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Do you know her?

516
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:06,093
Yes.

517
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:08,496
Before . . . on the streets . . .

518
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:12,199
we had a small problem.

519
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,823
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?!

520
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,400
Without any command,

521
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,476
which nation's law is that?

522
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,526
There are many people looking.

523
00:38:58,526 --> 00:39:00,848
I suggest that we move to a more private place

524
00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:03,251
to continue.

525
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,100
You tried to torture and get a confession without my royal decree?

526
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,600
Yes.

527
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,100
That woman not only disturbed Your Majesty's consummation ceremony...

528
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,300
and thereby disturbed our nation's peace
and order, but also

529
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,700
sent deadly spirits to harm Your Majesty's body.

530
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,400
How could we not punish her?

531
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,100
Are you speaking with solid evidence?

532
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,400
Though there is no firm evidence proving her guilt, there is also no evidence proving her innocence.

533
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,900
Thus, in order to find evidence towards either direction, we rushed to hold this trial.

534
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,600
If she has committed such a grave crime,

535
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,500
I will personally interrogate her

536
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,300
That's not proper. How can His Majesty sit face-to-face with a lowly woman.

537
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,700
Then...

538
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,840
do you all insist on disobeying my royal command!?

539
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,044
How could we, as royal officials,
 disobey His Majesty's royal command?

540
00:40:36,044 --> 00:40:37,786
But...

541
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,900
To protest thus is also unlike the King.

542
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,422
Many angry Sungkyunkwan scholars

543
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:49,924
are gathering here

544
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,100
asking for this heresy to be removed.

545
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,700
Are you not the King that must show them the way?

546
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,203
I'm begging you.

547
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:05,573
Do not waste any more time on this issue.

548
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:09,500
If you continue to fight,

549
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,200
those scholars will misinterpret your actions.

550
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,222
Yoon Dae Hyeong!
Yoon Dae Hyeong!

551
00:41:21,222 --> 00:41:23,057
Yoon Dae Hyeong!

552
00:41:23,992 --> 00:41:27,194
YOON DAE HYEONG!!

553
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,531
Where are you going?!

554
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:30,799
I will go to the prison.

555
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:32,433
You must not go!

556
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,200
She's not the type to tell a lie simply to spare her own life! So then how do you think this'll all end!?

557
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Your Majesty, before you are a man, 
 you are the nation's...

558
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,100
owner.

559
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,819
What do you think those officials are after?

560
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:56,400
Do you really think they're doing this because of a lowly shaman girl?

561
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,700
They

562
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:02,864
are trying to get everyone,

563
00:42:02,864 --> 00:42:05,166
Your Majesty,

564
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:08,570
to turn their back on you.

565
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:14,576
Just to save one thing, if you take a move easily,

566
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:18,479
you are going to lose much.

567
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,200
You must...

568
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,120
throw one away.

569
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:31,826
If you really go there and defend the girl,

570
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:34,362
you are going to...

571
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,200
lose them all.

572
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:51,212
Isn't she a wise one?

573
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,200
Then, she will be able to save herself.

574
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Believe in that child and

575
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,156
trust her . . . to take care of herself.

576
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:06,661
Only this path will save that child and

577
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:09,697
save your

578
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:12,567
nation.

579
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:12,493
I'll give you another chance to answer.

580
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:18,165
Why did you cast a spell on His Majesty?

581
00:44:21,302 --> 00:44:24,672
No matter how many times you ask,

582
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,776
my answer will be the same.

583
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:32,653
I...

584
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:35,182
definitely never...

585
00:44:35,182 --> 00:44:39,200
used witchcraft.

586
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:49,597
Even though I gave you the answer that could save your life,

587
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:54,502
you, yourself, have decided your fate.

588
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,800
If that is your choice,

589
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,376
it can't be helped.

590
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:05,346
Until a confession comes out of her lips,

591
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:06,948
keep torturing her!

592
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:08,516
Yes.

593
00:45:10,937 --> 00:45:13,955
Please save that child's life,
Your Highness.

594
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,500
It's impossible for her to curse His Majesty.

595
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,529
That child doesn't have that kind of skills.

596
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:24,665
How can I believe that?

597
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,600
It has already been a while since the King was aware of her presence.

598
00:45:28,615 --> 00:45:30,471
Why is it that I am only hearing

599
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,800
of this fact today?

600
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,100
That is, I didn't want to cause any unnecessary worry.

601
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,400
Although you knew that the King was aware of her presence,

602
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:45,386
why did you allow her to stay by his side?

603
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,200
Was it to seduce the King?

604
00:45:48,256 --> 00:45:49,390
So . . .

605
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,000
through your Spiritual Daughter,

606
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,329
did you want to gain power?

607
00:45:55,363 --> 00:45:59,801
Do you still not believe me?

608
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:02,503
In that dark heart of yours,

609
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,500
how can I know what's in it?

610
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,342
Then,

611
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:09,777
8 years ago,

612
00:46:09,777 --> 00:46:15,149
what did you believe of me
to tell me to make that curse?

613
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:19,587
How did you decide it was going to be me?

614
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:25,575
What did you believe of me to give me such a command?!

615
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:28,296
This woman . . .

616
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,700
Do you dare threaten me?

617
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,433
This servant,

618
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:35,570
for a long time, has stayed faithful to you.

619
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,472
After I received your command,

620
00:46:37,472 --> 00:46:43,111
I brought my spiritual daughter to the palace. Yet, you cannot keep that one life safe?

621
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:44,245
What?

622
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:46,915
Now that her life is in danger,

623
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:51,819
what is there for me to be afraid of?

624
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,000
After confessing all my sins,

625
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:58,293
with my Spiritual Daughter,

626
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:01,229
putting an end to this lowly life would be all.

627
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:04,165
You woman!
However,

628
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:09,604
the outcome for you will be different.

629
00:47:09,604 --> 00:47:13,708
If,

630
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:18,179
the King finds out what happened 8 years ago...

631
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:22,750
Your Highness, 
The King has arrived.

632
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:33,657
I am the Seongsucheong priestess, Shaman Jang.

633
00:47:33,657 --> 00:47:36,097
I now meet you.

634
00:47:36,097 --> 00:47:38,867
Wasn't the Seongsucheong priestess someone else?

635
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:40,134
She was only a temporary.

636
00:47:40,134 --> 00:47:49,143
I was the previous priestess. I left the Seongsucheong for a short period of time and recently returned.

637
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:05,860
I will leave now.

638
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,163
May you please forgive me.

639
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:31,419
Subtitles brought to you by "Eclipse Team" @ viki.com

640
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,922
A request?

641
00:48:34,922 --> 00:48:38,059
You rarely come here.

642
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,400
Now, you want a favor from this grandmother.

643
00:48:41,405 --> 00:48:46,301
During life, many surprising things can happen.

644
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,508
Why are you like this?

645
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:55,634
Grandmother,

646
00:48:55,634 --> 00:48:57,311
I beg you.

647
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:00,700
Please stop the torture,

648
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,577
before the situation becomes more grave.

649
00:49:03,577 --> 00:49:05,487
Please block it.

650
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,956
Why are you like this?

651
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:09,691
Are you...

652
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:13,661
afraid that the child might get hurt?

653
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:15,296
Don't tell me...

654
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:20,735
that you really care about a lowly shaman?

655
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:23,204
Am I not a man?

656
00:49:23,204 --> 00:49:26,107
Am I not a man?

657
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:30,407
Although I was momentarily infatuated,

658
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:33,114
it is not permanent.

659
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,300
How can the nation's leader fall in love with a lowly shaman girl?

660
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,223
I have, at least, that much common sense.

661
00:49:42,223 --> 00:49:44,058
Well,

662
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,800
I know your wise & bright mind won't be wavered that easily.

663
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
It is just that I

664
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,000
do not want this situation to get any bigger.

665
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,241
It's normal for a man to temporarily 
like the fragrance of flowers.

666
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,500
But if this situation gets out of hand . . .

667
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:06,305
And, since she is a shaman . . .

668
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:08,283
As the country's monarch,

669
00:50:08,283 --> 00:50:12,554
what pride would I have left?

670
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:15,229
I beg you, Grandmother.

671
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:18,626
to grant me this favor just this once.

672
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:23,965
But, I'm just an old lady like a toothless lion,

673
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,100
so what power do I have?

674
00:50:27,101 --> 00:50:30,405
How can you say such nonsense.

675
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,500
The only person that can control

676
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,100
both me, the king and the royal officials

677
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,600
is you, Grandmother.

678
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,300
 If I must throw away one,

679
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,393
 I would rather give up myself to

680
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:55,230
save that one thing.

681
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,300
You are more stubborn than I thought you would be.

682
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,300
I will ask for the last time.

683
00:51:15,383 --> 00:51:18,009
At that time,

684
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:19,200
where were you

685
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,900
and with whom?

686
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,700
What were you doing?

687
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,196
This servant . . .

688
00:51:24,196 --> 00:51:26,461
was alone . . .

689
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,800
in Seongsucheong.

690
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,500
Hit her!

691
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:43,240
I will prove that child's innocence.

692
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,193
Prince Yang Myung.

693
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,300
During the time of the crime,

694
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,300
this girl was with me at the Seongsucheong.

695
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:04,573
Why do you say such dangerous words?

696
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:05,734
Dangerous?

697
00:52:05,734 --> 00:52:08,270
For someone involved in politics to be with a shaman...

698
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:12,146
That you were at Seongsucheong are dangerous words

699
00:52:12,146 --> 00:52:14,222
that will cast suspicion upon you.

700
00:52:14,222 --> 00:52:17,360
Why would you have such cold-hearted thoughts?

701
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:21,349
A man and a woman meeting under the moonlight to conspire to rebel,

702
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:25,153
doesn't that disappoint our youth?

703
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,400
Then,

704
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:30,525
why were you in Seongsucheong?

705
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,500
Isn't it obvious?

706
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,700
- I asked her
- I asked him to come!

707
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,600
This person...

708
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,896
someone who helped me when i was in dangerous situation before

709
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:50,300
is my savior.

710
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:59,921
Because the life of a shaman was exhausting and hard, I wanted to run away, but had no way to do so.

711
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:01,523
So,

712
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:04,626
that night he came to the Seongsucheong

713
00:53:04,626 --> 00:53:06,961
and I asked him to

714
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:09,664
run away with me.

715
00:53:10,932 --> 00:53:14,803
I had no idea if he was a Prince.

716
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,600
If I did,

717
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:20,166
I wouldn't have asked him to come.

718
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,000
So this person . . .

719
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:27,115
is innocent.

720
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:33,054
So, here.

721
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,400
Doesn't this prove her innocence?

722
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,027
So,

723
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:42,830
free her, immediately!

724
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,100
Why are you stopping the torture?

725
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,347
According to Shaman Jang,

726
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:04,622
that girl, Wol, doesn't possess the skills for such a curse.

727
00:54:04,622 --> 00:54:10,091
Anyhow, since Prince Yang Myeong 
has already proven her innocence,

728
00:54:10,091 --> 00:54:12,500
why not just remove the charges?

729
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,400
Even if we pardon her of witchcraft, what about the crime of seducing a member of the royal family?

730
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,300
I'll just banish her from the city.

731
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,774
Anyway, I just need her away from His Majesty.

732
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,800
We were able to calm His Majesty.

733
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,500
So, we've accomplished our goal.

734
00:54:33,548 --> 00:54:35,984
We've also gained a trump card for the future,

735
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,720
which we'll be using in the near future.

736
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,857
By trump card, you mean...

737
00:54:42,857 --> 00:54:46,145
Romance between Prince and shaman.

738
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:50,832
Didn't you think of how we had to rid of Prince Ui Seong?

739
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:58,433
Now we'll decide the fate of Prince Yang Myung, 
who threatens the Majesty's position.

740
00:54:58,433 --> 00:55:01,109
It has just appeared in our hands.

741
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,500
Why did you come here?

742
00:55:36,392 --> 00:55:40,148
I came here to tell you a way so that you can live.

743
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,000
Tell them it was I that seduced you, not you that seduced me.

744
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,400
Although you won't be able to escape punishment, your sentence will be much lighter.

745
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,100
After that,
I'll take care of everything else.

746
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,400
I will not do that.

747
00:55:57,032 --> 00:55:59,481
You will not do it?

748
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,169
Why?

749
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:04,773
During interrogation, you were capable of lying.

750
00:56:04,773 --> 00:56:07,142
These words aren't even false.

751
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:09,511
I will find the way

752
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,400
to save my own life.

753
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,800
So do not waste your efforts on me ever again.

754
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,800
No.
I can't do that.

755
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:25,500
I can't be in debt to a shaman.

756
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,800
Since you lied for me . . . this time-

757
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,400
Do you think I lied for you?

758
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,400
You didn't?

759
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,141
I only used you

760
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,500
to save my own life.

761
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:48,016
If you think I did it for you,

762
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,700
you've misunderstood.

763
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,600
Don't worry.

764
00:56:57,392 --> 00:57:00,744
I'm not doing this for you.

765
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:06,734
It was because I couldn't go on a journey
 because of this kind of situation. So . . .

766
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,600
Stay alive in any situation.

767
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,200
If you really don't like this idea,
then, find another idea.

768
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
So my older brother

769
00:57:38,533 --> 00:57:42,137
showed up to save the girl?

770
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:45,841
Then,

771
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:51,046
my older brother must have also known about that girl.

772
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,800
Woon, you too...

773
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,200
It looks like you already knew.

774
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:05,827
Your Majesty, it's me Hyung Sun.

775
00:58:05,827 --> 00:58:07,695
Come in.

776
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,200
Your Majesty,
Prince Yang Myung has arrived.

777
00:58:26,114 --> 00:58:27,890
Have you...

778
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,352
been well?

779
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,200
I'm sorry

780
00:58:41,263 --> 00:58:43,732
that I gave you so much pain.

781
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,600
But if I do not put an end to this myself . . .

782
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,700
The King will also . . .

783
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,700
And, you too . . .

784
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,578
will be in danger.

785
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,500
As someone who had no other choice,

786
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,100
please don't forgive me.

787
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,200
For what reason have you come all the way here?

788
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,664
Doing nothing is usually my daily routine.

789
00:59:15,664 --> 00:59:17,768
But today,

790
00:59:17,768 --> 00:59:22,637
I was quite busy visiting the interrogation room.

791
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,474
Ah,

792
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:27,642
I heard that you substantiated her alibi.

793
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:31,100
For you to interfere,

794
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,100
in behalf of a mere shaman,

795
00:59:34,088 --> 00:59:36,151
it's very unlike you.

796
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:39,754
It seems like you don't know me well.

797
00:59:39,754 --> 00:59:41,497
I...

798
00:59:41,497 --> 00:59:47,933
am different from you. I am willing to throw away everything for one precious thing.

799
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,300
I live thinking like that.

800
00:59:50,365 --> 00:59:52,500
Then,

801
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,200
because of my selfishness to have everything,

802
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,672
I am unable to realize the importance of that one precious thing.

803
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,900
Are you saying that?

804
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,800
As the nation's leader, it is obvious that you would have to think that way.

805
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,700
So, this servant,

806
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:09,150
has come to request..

807
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,120
for something that is insignificant to Your Majesty.

808
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,200
Please allow.

809
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,100
I will not allow it.

810
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,300
Why are you not allowing it?

811
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:29,700
Your reputation is closely related to the reputation of the Royal Family.

812
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,300
I only have the title of Prince.  
Everything else is superficial.

813
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,600
How can someone like me have something like reputation as a member of the Royal Family?

814
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:40,382
With Your Majesty's permission, I can abandon them anytime,

815
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:41,400
in exchange for her.

816
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,600
Do not do it!

817
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:55,463
You told me, while I was a Crown Prince,

818
01:00:55,463 --> 01:00:58,733
that you would have protected her.

819
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,000
Even if you had to give up everything,
 including your life,

820
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,973
you would have been able to protect her.

821
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,944
Do you still think that now?

822
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:12,247
By keeping her close to you,

823
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:14,950
how do you hope to keep her safe?

824
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,900
Think about it again.

825
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,189
What course of action

826
01:01:21,189 --> 01:01:24,326
would really keep her safe?

827
01:01:29,197 --> 01:01:32,167
The things that I did before

828
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:37,639
and the things I hoped to come
 were too easily dismissed by him.

829
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:43,164
If he will not allow me the one thing I truly want...

830
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,449
I. . .

831
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,000
Do you think I was cruel to Hyungnim?

832
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:56,300
Do you think I gave a wound to Hyungnim?

833
01:01:56,324 --> 01:01:58,693
But . . .

834
01:01:58,693 --> 01:02:01,800
Isn't it you who received the wound?

835
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,730
Woon.

836
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,200
I no longer

837
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,100
want to lose precious people.

838
01:02:11,139 --> 01:02:12,440
However,

839
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,878
the life of my older brother is no longer safe.

840
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,900
Just as the royal officials

841
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:22,350
wanted to use the girl to snap my neck,

842
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,900
they will use hyungnim's love for that shaman

843
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,500
to use it against him.

844
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,200
Isn't it sad that

845
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,300
the person who will receive the most wounds will be...

846
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,000
Wol.

847
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,171
It will be that child, Wol.
