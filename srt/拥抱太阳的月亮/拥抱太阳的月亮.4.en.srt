1
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,902
Your name is Yeon U...

2
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:43,005
Does it mean soft rain?

3
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:47,609
Yes, in Chinese characters that is the meaning.

4
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,814
Then, it can also be interpreted as dew rain.

5
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,018
It's a beautiful name.

6
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,822
Please forgive me for being bold.

7
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:08,530
Can I ask the meaning of Your Highness's Hwi?
-=Hwi: the King's name. It's a taboo to directly
address the King by his given name.=-

8
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:13,835
It means "sun".
The king chose it himself.

9
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:17,439
<i>Lee Hwon.</i>

10
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:26,748
Earlier... why did you keep avoiding me?

11
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:36,658
Do you... dislike me?

12
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,661
No, I don't.

13
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:42,564
You don't hate me?

14
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,474
Then, why did you refuse to see me
and make me take a risk to see you?

15
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,480
Still not answering?

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,887
Doesn't Your Highness already
have someone else in your heart?

17
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:07,890
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,792
Not long ago...

19
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:14,696
I heard that Your Highness met the
Minister of Personnel's daughter here.

20
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:16,899
That's all because of you.

21
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:19,001
If you hadn't told a lie,

22
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:22,604
then I wouldn't have mistaken her for
you, causing a misunderstanding.

23
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:25,107
<i>A misunderstanding?</i>

24
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:28,110
Then...

25
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,114
I didn't even blame you,
why are you blaming me...

26
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:38,220
Wait a moment. Don't tell me, you...

27
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,421
What?

28
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:45,127
You were jealous that I met her.

29
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:49,431
What? No... I wasn't.

30
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,836
This... how is this good?

31
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:58,240
A woman with a jealous heart is very scary.

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,843
For a person who's going to become
my "rain" in the future, such jealousy is...

33
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:05,447
I already said I wasn't, so don't keep...

34
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:09,051
What?

35
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,355
The marriage restriction law will
be announced in a few days.

36
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:17,059
Soon the Princess Successor will be selected.

37
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,162
You'll probably be chosen as a candidate.

38
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,965
I'll be waiting.

39
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:27,369
You'll surely become the Princess Successor.

40
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,431
Even though Your Highness said to throw it away,

41
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:32,134
but I knew Your Highness will
definitely look for it again.

42
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:35,837
I was right in not throwing it away.

43
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:36,838
Hyeong Seon...

44
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:38,340
Yes, Your Highness.

45
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,344
Yeon U's reason for giving me this lettuce,

46
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,646
you don't know it, right?

47
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:49,851
It has a deeper meaning, conveying
the expectations of the common people.

48
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:59,161
Everyday Your Highness waits to
see what type of flower will bloom.

49
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:02,264
But no matter how much Your Highness waits,

50
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:06,468
it can't be compared to the farmers's
wait for their crops to mature.

51
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:09,271
Besides, lettuce can be used as medicine.

52
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,774
In the beginning, the wait
might make a person tired,

53
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,877
but, not long after, the lettuce will
make the person full of energy.

54
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:19,081
It can increase one's intelligence
and can also reduce fever.

55
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:24,086
At that time, Your Highness wasn't
satisfied with Literature Teacher Heo.

56
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:26,388
Miss Yeon U's message to Your Highness is

57
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:28,390
to not trouble Literature Teacher Heo again

58
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,394
and concentrate on your studies.

59
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:37,599
How do you know all of this?

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,803
Yeon U only told it to me.

61
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:44,406
Regarding the story of the lettuce,

62
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:47,209
this is already the 14th time that I heard it.

63
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:49,411
My head is not made of stone.

64
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,914
How could I forget it?

65
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,815
I was the one to tell you about it?

66
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:55,017
Yes.

67
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:55,817
When?

68
00:05:55,817 --> 00:06:00,022
Ever since the time you two met and talked about
the meaning of lettuce at the Silver Moon Building.

69
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:05,227
Once you see me or when you have time, you keep...

70
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:10,332
Then, you are also amazed with Yeon U's wisdom, right?

71
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:14,036
I was indeed amazed at the beginning...

72
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:17,940
But listening repeatedly to a good song will...

73
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,349
Wait and see.

74
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,852
That child will definitely become
the Queen of this country.

75
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:33,255
A Queen who is revered by millions.

76
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:44,166
Marriage Restriction Order.

77
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:03,085
<i>Today's lesson will end here.</i>

78
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:12,794
Yeon U, has she placed her name
on the list for the selection?

79
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,700
Not yet.

80
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:25,207
Is something wrong?

81
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,912
Crown Prince, Your Highness,

82
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:34,516
please listen to my earnest request.

83
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,817
What request?

84
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:37,819
As long as a girl is a citizen of Joseon,

85
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,323
she should get listed for the selection.

86
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:45,827
But, can my dongsaeng please...
please not get listed?

87
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,132
I'm kneeling to beg you, Your Highness.

88
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:54,336
For an honest and upright people like you,

89
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:58,040
why do you ask for such a request?

90
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,443
I asked you a question.

91
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,545
Hurry up and answer.

92
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:10,252
It's not possible for Your Highness
to be together with my sister.

93
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,756
Yeon U and I can't be together?

94
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:16,458
That's absurd.

95
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:22,664
I'm... willing to accept any
punishment from Your Highness,

96
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,765
but please...

97
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:25,567
This is a violation to the state's law,

98
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:28,170
are you willing to become a traitor?

99
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,671
Your Highness...

100
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:36,378
I can't do that.

101
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:38,981
I can't fulfill your request.

102
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,383
My first reason is that I don't want to lose you.

103
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,385
The second reason is that I...

104
00:08:53,495 --> 00:09:09,011
I... like you.
<i>(Teacher Heo's sister.)</i>

105
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,932
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

106
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,234
It's not like that.

107
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:36,538
The person His Highness likes is definitely
not Literature Teacher Heo.

108
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:45,447
Please don't misunderstand.

109
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:47,049
It's not you, Literature Teacher Heo.

110
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:49,451
Although I can't say specifically who it is,

111
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:56,158
but it's a "woman" who resembles you very much.

112
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,260
Your Highness. Your Highness.

113
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:10,572
Your Highness.

114
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:12,674
How could you create such an awkward situation?

115
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,577
You should be more specific
when you are confessing!

116
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:17,079
You're too noisy.

117
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,781
I haven't even confessed to Yeon U yet,

118
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:22,084
so how could I bring this up in front of others first?

119
00:10:22,084 --> 00:10:25,587
Your Highness shouldn't have
brought this up in the first place.

120
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:27,389
Disappointed, Disappointed,
Extremely Disappointed...

121
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,390
If it's other people, I can just forget it.

122
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,994
How can Teacher Heo ask for such a favor?

123
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:38,700
Your Highness, do you really not know?

124
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,704
He feels that I don't deserve
to be with his sister, right?

125
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:44,406
Forgive me if I say too much,

126
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:48,010
but that isn't Literature Teacher Heo's intention.

127
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:54,116
What do you mean by that?

128
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:59,821
<i>The person to be selected
has been decided, right?</i>

129
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:03,625
The Minister of Personnel's daughter has already
been decided to become the Crown Princess,

130
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,527
so why should there be a list for selection?

131
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:09,231
Even if you want wealth and glory,
you can't send her there.

132
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,835
Wife, what are you doing?

133
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:20,042
What should we do if our Yeon U
becomes one of the three finalists?

134
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:22,844
Give it back to me.

135
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:26,548
Among the three women, those who aren't selected

136
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:28,750
will still be Crown Prince's women,

137
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,054
and will have to spend their entire life alone.
Didn't you know, My Lord?

138
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:33,455
Madam!

139
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,557
Our Yeon U

140
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:38,360
will have to comb her hair by herself,

141
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,963
and will only wear plain clothes all her life.

142
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,866
She will spend the rest of her life alone. Don't tell me
you have the heart to let her live like that.

143
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:47,669
As an official of the court, how can I
bend the law to my own advantage?

144
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:50,472
My Lord, don't be so stubborn.

145
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:52,374
You could ask His Majesty

146
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:55,777
to let Yeon U be exempt from the selection.

147
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:57,579
Absolutely not.

148
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,083
This would be disloyalty towards His Majesty.
We absolutely cannot do that.

149
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,586
Then, Lord, do you want to just sit and watch?

150
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:09,591
Teacher Heo was just thinking for his sister's sake.

151
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:12,194
That's why he dared to make
such a request to Your Highness.

152
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:19,401
So the women who aren't chosen
cannot enter the palace again?

153
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:24,006
A little later they can also enter the
palace to become an imperial concubine.

154
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:28,911
Don't tell me...
Yang Myeong Hyeongnim's mother was also...

155
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,212
That's right.

156
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:33,315
Concubine Hee Bin wasn't selected as Crown Princess.

157
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:35,517
But after she received His Majesty's favor,

158
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:37,519
she was able to enter the palace.

159
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,024
But most of these women will eventually be forgotten.

160
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:47,529
Your Highness.

161
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,032
Grandmother.

162
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,133
What?

163
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:58,240
The one who is in charge of choosing
the Crown Princess

164
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,742
is the Queen Dowager.

165
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:05,747
How can the Queen Dowager and her family
resist this great opportunity to gain further power?

166
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:07,950
The chosen one is definitely...

167
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,755
<i>I'm the daughter of Minister of Personnel,
Yun Bo Gyeong.</i>

168
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:18,660
Your Highness. Your Highness.

169
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,400
Your Highness, where do you want to go?

170
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:26,500
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince is here to see you.

171
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,870
-= King Seong Jo =-

172
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:41,183
Father, I came here to ask you a favor.

173
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,886
Can you send them away first?

174
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,793
What do you have to say?

175
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,800
Father.

176
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:02,404
Regarding the predetermined
of the Princess Successor,

177
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:06,408
please revoke your command, father.

178
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,427
Is the Crown Prince currently meeting with His Majesty?

179
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:26,929
That's right.

180
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,231
Will it last long?

181
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:33,735
His Majesty commanded us not
to let anyone disturb them.

182
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:40,742
The person who is in charge of this matter

183
00:14:40,742 --> 00:14:42,844
is not me, but the Queen Dowager.

184
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,847
Then please, Father, give an order

185
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:47,950
to select the Crown Princess

186
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,851
based on a strict and a fair criteria.

187
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:52,254
This is something even I, the
King, can't do anything about.

188
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:54,356
You should go to the Queen Dowager's
Palace and discuss this matter with her.

189
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:58,060
Please, Father, convince the Queen Dowager.

190
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,864
Even the King cannot be in charge of everything.

191
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:04,967
Furthermore, it would be disrespectful for me
to go against the Queen Dowager's wishes in this area.

192
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:08,770
I know that there is a precedent of Chingan.
-= Chingan: when the king personally makes a selection =-

193
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,675
I won't make a rash move just
because of your selfishness.

194
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:15,577
It is not my selfishness.

195
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:17,179
If it is not selfishness, then what is it?

196
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,881
It's Crown Princess.

197
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:22,184
This is about choosing the woman
who will be the mother of our country.

198
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:24,486
To choose one woman to sit in that position,

199
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:26,188
shouldn't this matter be carefully thought out?

200
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,491
If you know how serious this matter is,
how can you still act so recklessly?

201
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:32,294
This royal wedding is to cover up
the potential scandal that you caused
by your behavior.

202
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:35,097
All these problems started because of you.

203
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:38,200
You think you can avoid your responsibility?

204
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,906
If I can resolve all these problems successfully,

205
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,115
can you make a fair selection of the Crown Princess?

206
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:15,337
Find someone to investigate immediately,

207
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,839
about the situation of the Jae Hoe at Sungkyunkwan,
-= Jae Hoe: Union of Confucian Scholars at
Sungkyunkwan, a kind of student union =-

208
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,144
and also all details on who holds the
position of Jangui at Sungkyunkwan.
-= Jangui: President of the Sungkyunkwan Student Union =-

209
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:25,347
What? Why should I find the Jangui?

210
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:32,955
This mission is my only chance.
If this leaks out, I'll be dead.

211
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:38,060
This matter will also bring benefits to you too.
Don't you understand?

212
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,364
Yes, I understand.
I'll comply with your order.

213
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,271
Promise?

214
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:53,675
What did I promise you?

215
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,578
You promised that when the Crown
Prince's wife selection is over,

216
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:00,282
I could marry Office of Special
Advisors's Chief Scholar's daughter.

217
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:02,484
I never promised you that.

218
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:04,987
But, you said...

219
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:10,191
I only said that I would consider your request.
I never promised anything.

220
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,896
If there is nothing else to report,
then please leave.

221
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:20,502
Now your talk has changed.

222
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:25,207
Is it because you favor the Crown Prince?

223
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:32,114
Don't tell me that the Crown Prince
made the same request as I did.

224
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:35,017
Just like among men,

225
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:39,721
some will be King, others are subjects.

226
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:42,824
Women are also the same.

227
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:48,230
Some want to be the center of power
in the palace.

228
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,633
It's the daughter of the Chief Scholar
of the Office of Special Advisors.

229
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:54,336
Are you saying that she will become queen?

230
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:58,440
If the child is chosen, then it is possible.

231
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:02,444
If she gets eliminated from the selection,

232
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:06,949
can you give her to me?

233
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:13,855
The final 3 women that are eliminated
are also the Crown Prince's women.

234
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:15,457
Don't tell me you forgot this national law.

235
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:17,259
So, you want...

236
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,761
to let your servant see his beloved woman...

237
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:22,464
become depressed?

238
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:23,665
What?

239
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:25,467
Everyone knows that the
Minister of Personnel's daughter

240
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:28,770
has already been decided to
become the Crown Princess.

241
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,073
How can your servant just sit and watch?

242
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:35,177
Do I really have to punish you
so that you will stop talking?

243
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:38,680
Do not ever mention about this topic again.

244
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,683
If you repeat your request again,
I will see it as...

245
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,687
...a rebellion.

246
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:20,322
<i>Do not laugh!</i>

247
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:25,027
<i>The only thing that your servant wants,</i>

248
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:28,630
<i>the only person that your servant wants,</i>

249
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,234
<i>In your gentle way, you take it all,
Your Highness Crown Prince.</i>

250
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:39,241
<i>Please, stop smiling that way,</i>

251
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:43,845
<i>so that I can freely hate you, Your Highness.</i>

252
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:46,248
<i>Please...</i>

253
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:56,458
<i>If that is impossible,</i>

254
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,162
<i>please remove my hatred of you...</i>

255
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:05,367
<i>...and my strong desire for her.</i>

256
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,677
Your Majesty.

257
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:23,585
Let's go to the King's Palace Hall. I want
to listen to the princess's laughter.

258
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:03,926
I'm sorry. I was thinking of a
problem so I didn't see you.

259
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:09,231
This is your handmade longevity strand.
Please keep it.

260
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:12,534
Thank you very much.

261
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:16,038
But, why would you give this to Your Servant?

262
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,241
Why?

263
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:24,546
Has Yeon U been well? That's the reason.

264
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:28,850
Yes, she has been very well.

265
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:34,856
But... are you married?

266
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,959
I am not married yet.

267
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,962
Then, a fiancé?

268
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:41,864
Do you have a fiancé?

269
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,666
No, I still don't have something like that.

270
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:55,777
Recently, I have been studying
Biographies of Exemplary Women.

271
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:56,778
What?

272
00:21:56,778 --> 00:22:00,382
Last time, His Highness the Crown Prince said that
I didn't learn the Thousand Character Classic.
-= 6th century poem used as a traditional reading primer.=-

273
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:02,284
That is not true.

274
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:08,190
Right, I answered your riddle correctly!

275
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,695
Close your eyes like this,
and the whole world becomes dark.

276
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:16,899
Open your eyes like this...

277
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:19,301
Look at me.

278
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:25,107
Just look.

279
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:30,512
Close your eyes like this,
and the whole world becomes dark.

280
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:38,820
Open your eyes like this, the world...
becomes bright.

281
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:47,229
How pretty...

282
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:15,557
Your Majesty Royal Father.

283
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:18,260
That's my princess.

284
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:28,570
I am not a child anymore.

285
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:30,472
What?

286
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:36,378
I have something to tell to Your Majesty.

287
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:40,382
Please come to my room.

288
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:46,488
What does my princess want to tell me?

289
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:52,794
You want to get betrothed
to Literature Teacher Heo?

290
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,796
Yes.

291
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:05,908
Your Majesty has accepted the Crown
Prince's choice without hesitation.

292
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:09,511
I also...

293
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:11,413
No.

294
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:17,619
What?
Why not?

295
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:21,223
This person will become the pillar of the country,
an incomparable genius seen only once
every hundred years.

296
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:28,530
Is that why he cannot become a princess's husband?

297
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:33,635
You are too young so you wouldn't understand.

298
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:36,738
If he becomes an Uibin, he cannot
take up an official post.
-= Uibin: Princess's husband, King's son-in-law =-

299
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:41,143
Neither can he participate in politics.

300
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:42,544
Therefore,

301
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:48,650
I can't let a talented person
like him become an Uibin.

302
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,854
What? If that's the case,

303
00:24:52,854 --> 00:25:02,764
I can only marry someone ugly and stupid?

304
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:07,769
That is not what I meant. It is only
Literature Teacher Heo you cannot marry.

305
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:10,072
He may still want to assist the future king
with his talent...

306
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:11,874
...in leading this country.

307
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:17,880
I don't want to.
All other people get handsome men.

308
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,683
How come a princess can only marry ugly idiots?

309
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:25,287
Not idiots. I will find you a good match.

310
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:31,393
No! I want to marry that person!

311
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:36,899
I already said you can't.
Min Hwa...

312
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:39,701
He is the type of person who cannot become an Uibin.

313
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:42,504
Using Uibin as an excuse to bury
his talent, and prevent him

314
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:43,705
to develop his ability.

315
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,208
We can't do that to him.

316
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,811
So, you should forget Literature Teacher Heo.

317
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:04,026
I don't want to.

318
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,859
Your swordsmanship is not bad.

319
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:39,661
I am sorry, Young Master.

320
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:41,363
It's all right.

321
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:45,067
But, why did you come?

322
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:49,371
Ah, I actually have something to ask you.

323
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:55,978
First, look at my face.

324
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:58,280
What?
How can a lowly person like me

325
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,182
look at Young Master's face?

326
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:02,885
It's all right. Look at me.

327
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:09,291
If there's a woman who looks like me,

328
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,994
who would it be?

329
00:27:12,794 --> 00:27:15,497
Miss Yeon U.

330
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,305
Just as I thought.
But they never met.

331
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:28,911
How did they meet? When and where?

332
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:31,813
On the day of your announcement ceremony,

333
00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:35,317
we met accidentally at the palace.

334
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:41,323
Do you feel the same as the Crown Prince?

335
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:44,426
Does your heart feel the same?

336
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:53,335
I know what Orabeoni is worried about, but...

337
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:56,638
Did you know for the selection
of the Crown Princess,

338
00:27:56,638 --> 00:27:59,741
they have chosen someone else?

339
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:04,947
I know.

340
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:12,253
Tell them that you have an illness as an excuse.

341
00:28:12,254 --> 00:28:15,657
You should feign illness to avoid the selection.

342
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:21,463
Do you still remember the time when
I taught you how to play Go (weiqi)?

343
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:24,566
Avoid the stronger opponent
and defend yourself first.

344
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:27,069
When your opponent is stronger,

345
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,271
you should ensure your own safety first.

346
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:30,072
Orabeoni...

347
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:33,675
If they know about your relationship
with the Crown Prince,

348
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:35,777
you will be in danger.

349
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:41,083
Yeon U, you might become a scapegoat.

350
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:46,288
I can't do that.

351
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:47,789
Yeon U!

352
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:54,596
I do not retreat. I cannot withdraw
a move in a good game of chess.

353
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:58,000
This is also something you taught me.

354
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,503
It is the same with a person's feelings.

355
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:06,008
Only when you are determined,
you will not easily waver.

356
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:09,010
Regardless of what the final result
of the selection might be, I...

357
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:17,519
I cannot lie to His Highness.

358
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:38,340
But, why are you making me pretend to be an official?

359
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,043
Can you please tell me the reason?

360
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:43,645
How come you're not saying anything?

361
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:53,155
Pay respect to His Highness.

362
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:57,059
Yes.
-= Seonggyungwan Jangui - Hong Gyu Tae =-

363
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:05,567
Are you the president of the Sungkyunkwan
Student Union, Hong Gyu Tae?

364
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:08,170
Yes, I am.

365
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,772
Why did you want to see me, this lowly person?

366
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:13,375
When I was given the title of Crown Prince,

367
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,777
I was also admitted to study at
Sungkyunkwan at the same time.

368
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:19,281
I was never able to study with you,

369
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:22,484
but to be considered a Sungkyunkwan scholar like you,

370
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:23,685
I feel very proud.

371
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:25,687
I don't deserve your praise.

372
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:31,994
However, recently I've felt that studying
at Sungkyunkwan...

373
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:35,497
- ...is disgraceful.
- What?

374
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:40,502
You must use what you've studied and
assist the King in following the right path.

375
00:30:40,502 --> 00:30:42,905
That's your duty as an official.

376
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:49,011
Why is Sungkyunkwan only become observer
of the current situation?

377
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:55,417
I don't know if I can guess correctly.

378
00:30:55,417 --> 00:31:01,123
Do you mean the upcoming selection
of the Princess Successor?

379
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:04,326
Please raise it as an official issue to the court.

380
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:07,329
The selection of the Crown Princess,

381
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:14,136
how can it be used as a mean
to preserve a clan's power?

382
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:41,663
You mean to prepare for the unexpected?

383
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:46,568
Yes, the person His Majesty
and the Crown Prince want...

384
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:49,671
...is Heo Young Jae's daughter.

385
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:51,473
I can't just sit and watch.

386
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:57,079
Rest assured. The power
of selection is in my hands.

387
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:02,784
Of the people surrounding His Highness,
is the Princess Successor the only one?

388
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:07,990
Later, that child could become favored
as an imperial concubine.

389
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,291
No big deal.

390
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:15,998
Not only that, but if that child
were the first to give birth...

391
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:19,301
Would you still say it's no big deal?

392
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:22,404
You are right.

393
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:26,708
It is best to have a plan for the unexpected.

394
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:32,714
But it's hard to make a counter plan.

395
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:37,419
You can even remove the sun.

396
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,522
How can a moon be difficult?

397
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:46,328
Furthermore, the Celestial Hall's shaman
is also one of Your Highness' people.

398
00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:48,830
What are you afraid of?

399
00:32:56,939 --> 00:33:00,242
All of you know from history that a
Queen Dowager's family with political power

400
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:03,946
can bring about certain circumstances.

401
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:06,448
Already, the selling of offices and
positions has become common.

402
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:09,451
Many people have already fallen into
the influence of the Queen's family.

403
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:13,655
It's hard to say that those people who have bought
official positions with money are good officials.

404
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:17,259
We, Sungkyunkwan scholars,
who receive officials' salaries

405
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:20,162
how can we just sit and watch?

406
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:25,767
- Sungkyunkwan scholars present a petition.
- Present a petition!

407
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:31,974
- Sungkyunkwan scholars present a petition.
- Present a petition!

408
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,884
<i>This student demonstration was
organized personally by the Crown Prince.</i>

409
00:33:41,884 --> 00:33:46,688
<i>Joseon's future shall be very interesting.</i>

410
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:49,191
<i>Things should be set right
and put in the right place.</i>

411
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:53,195
<i>I believe this is what real politics are.</i>

412
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:56,398
<i>All living things, especially people,</i>

413
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,902
<i>should be able to find positions that suit them.</i>

414
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:05,706
<i>This is what I plan to do when I am the King.</i>

415
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:07,209
<i>Shouldn't this beginning...</i>

416
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:12,314
<i>...start from the selection of my consort?</i>

417
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:15,416
<i>This is what you think is the right principle?</i>

418
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:17,519
Yes.

419
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,925
<i>Then... show me...</i>

420
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:26,128
<i>...and convince me...</i>

421
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:28,530
<i>...that this is...</i>

422
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,532
<i>...politic.</i>

423
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:39,840
<i>Going through Sunkyunkwan to create
public outcry?</i>

424
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,744
<i>That is not bad, Crown Prince.</i>

425
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:47,249
Please reply to our request, Your Majesty.

426
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:49,751
Please reply to our request.

427
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:56,858
Please eliminate the law that made
another relative can select the Crown Princess.

428
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,173
Hogok Gwondang. We are almost about to make the selection,
-= Hogok Gwondang : demonstration method where you sit
outside the palace, wailing and crying =-

429
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:12,674
what is going on here?

430
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:14,877
It's already fifth day, Your Majesty.

431
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:18,180
You must give them an official response.

432
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,282
That is correct, Your Highness.

433
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:22,084
According to tradition,
Sungkyunkwan scholars' petitions,

434
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,486
regardless of whether they are right or wrong,

435
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:27,489
must receive an official reply from the king.
It is tradition.

436
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:30,692
This is absolutely wrong, Your Majesty.

437
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:34,496
Since ancient times, the selection has been
the responsibility of the Queen Dowager.

438
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:38,300
Don't pay too much attention to their irrational ideas.

439
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,203
My thoughts are the same, Your Majesty.

440
00:35:41,203 --> 00:35:43,105
We are facing a celebratory occasion for the country.

441
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:45,908
Creating an uproar is an outrageous act.

442
00:35:45,908 --> 00:35:50,412
You must punish the leaders of this movement severely.

443
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:53,115
You must punish them severely.

444
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:56,318
They acted out of worry for the
country and without selfishness.

445
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:58,921
How can you say that it's wrong?

446
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,023
If we defeat their will,

447
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:03,225
and block the path of honest and wise advice,

448
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:09,031
who will have the courage in the future to concern
themselves with national affairs and criticize
national policy?

449
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:11,733
No matter what dynasty we are in,
public discussion...

450
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:15,537
...has always be recognized to capture
people's heart.

451
00:36:15,537 --> 00:36:17,539
When there is public discussion
on an issue,

452
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,542
even an outcast cannot be looked down upon.

453
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:23,045
When there are no public discussion
on an issue,

454
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:27,349
even a Minister of the State wouldn't have authority.

455
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:31,453
At the Council of Three,
I have reviewed their petition.

456
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:36,959
Giving an official response after looking for
the answer in public opinion is the right way.

457
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:39,761
But, Your Majesty...

458
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:41,864
Listen to the imperial order.

459
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:43,565
At your service, Your Highness.

460
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:48,871
I will give response to the scholars' petition
that goes as follows.

461
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,474
I believe in your loyalty

462
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:55,177
and plan to take your advice on national policies.

463
00:36:55,177 --> 00:37:00,382
So, this time's selection of the Crown Princess

464
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:04,586
will break the tradition where
Queen Dowager holds the jurisdiction.

465
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:09,491
I will personally make the selection.

466
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,899
Together with me, there will be
a member of the royal family,

467
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:19,201
an official from the Three Offices,
and a Minister of the State.

468
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:24,406
Every family will participate
to make the selection fair

469
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:27,509
and more just,

470
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:30,312
so the selection will not be done
by the Dowager Queen,

471
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:32,114
but by the King himself.

472
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:35,117
Furthermore, to prevent the squandering
of national treasury,

473
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:36,718
and to lessen the people's hardships,

474
00:37:36,718 --> 00:37:38,220
there won't be a stage 3,

475
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,923
instead we will just stop at stage 2.

476
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:45,427
A royal marriage is used to extend
the country's lifeline.

477
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:49,131
For such important matter like the royal consort,

478
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:53,135
how could you listen to ignorant scholars' slander?

479
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:57,940
How could you call the scholars'
honest advice as a slander?

480
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,043
Honest advice, slanderous talk.

481
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:04,446
For the decision to be made in advance
is also a part of the selection process.

482
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,148
Denying this...

483
00:38:06,148 --> 00:38:09,051
...is like denying the legitimacy of the royal family.

484
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:11,053
Mother.

485
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:13,855
The woman who is chosen
after many consideration...

486
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:18,760
...is not chosen because she is
a blood relative, didn't you know?

487
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:23,765
If it's like that, then changing the selection
process shouldn't cause any problems.

488
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:24,867
What are you saying?

489
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:28,170
If she is such a great girl, then even if
it has not been decided beforehand,

490
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,572
she will still be chosen, isn't that right?

491
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:35,677
So, you must oppose me,
is that so?

492
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:39,081
The common people are voicing
their thoughts unanimously.

493
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,384
I cannot stay out of this matter anymore.

494
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:44,987
Even if there is no reason for a ruler to be loyal,

495
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:47,789
there must be a reason for him to be filial.

496
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:50,192
As a country's ruler,

497
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:53,595
how could I only have blood-related parents?

498
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:56,098
The parent of the commoners is the King.

499
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:58,901
So the King's parents are also the commoners.

500
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,202
Your Majesty.

501
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:02,604
Mother.

502
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:08,010
Your Majesty's throne,

503
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,613
who was the one that protected it
from the opposing ministers?

504
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:17,619
I hope you didn't forget that
those were done by my clan and I.

505
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,524
I didn't forget that.

506
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:26,328
How could I forget?

507
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:38,140
For the sake of your clan's wealth and power,

508
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:43,545
Mother and Yun Dae Hyeong did a cruel thing.

509
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:50,452
That is why Prince Ui Seong was innocently killed.

510
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:06,268
If you knew about it,
then you can't treat me like this.

511
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:13,075
Because of me, Your Majesty's hands
have yet to be stained with blood.

512
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:16,678
What is the reason for me to remain silent?

513
00:40:16,678 --> 00:40:18,180
Even though I learned the truth later,

514
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:23,685
why was I unable to give
Prince Ui Seong a redress?

515
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,895
I remained silent for thirteen years to
fulfill filial piety to the greatest extent.

516
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:38,700
So, please don't make another greedy request.

517
00:40:40,302 --> 00:40:45,307
The selection of the Crown Princess
will proceed fairly.

518
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,912
Is there someone out there?

519
00:40:49,912 --> 00:40:52,915
Serve the Queen Dowager well.

520
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:26,949
<i>Your Majesty, you can't treat me like this.</i>

521
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:32,654
<i>Just wait and see. I will not concede.</i>

522
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,864
You can't do it that way.
Don't you think it's too gentle like that?

523
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:47,469
Make larger movements and sit down.

524
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:54,276
Like this?

525
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:58,080
That's right.
That's how you should do it.

526
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,982
When there's noodles on the dining table,

527
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:02,784
you must make some sound when you eat them.

528
00:42:02,784 --> 00:42:07,389
The uglier you look while you eat, the better.

529
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:09,892
And then, say reading is your hobby.

530
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:13,996
As for embroidery, just say that you can't do it.

531
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:19,501
These are the truth so it won't
be too difficult for you to answer.

532
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:22,804
If they ask you about
how much you have learned,

533
00:42:22,804 --> 00:42:29,111
you must say that you are already well versed in
the Four Books and Five Classics at the age of three.

534
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:33,415
Hmm, what else is there?

535
00:42:34,616 --> 00:42:36,118
Mother.

536
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,321
What's wrong?

537
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:44,626
Will I definitely fail to be chosen like this?

538
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:48,931
What do you mean by that?

539
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:53,135
I'm just saying that
for the sake of the selection...

540
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:58,840
You are aware of it too?

541
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,943
Isn't it even stranger if I didn't know?

542
00:43:00,943 --> 00:43:02,945
Don't be like this, Mother.

543
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:04,846
No matter what the outcome may be,

544
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:10,852
at least I want to be a daughter that Father
can be proud of when I'm in front of him.

545
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:16,758
So Mother, just watch me.

546
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:13,916
<i>I will be waiting for you.</i>

547
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:18,720
<i>If it is you, you'll definitely
become the Crown Princess.</i>

548
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:28,730
It's so late and again, why are you...

549
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:38,240
Where are you going?

550
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,443
After being here for few days,
I want to go on a trip again.

551
00:44:41,443 --> 00:44:46,648
I came because I wanted to see you
before I leave.

552
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:04,166
What an ugly face.

553
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:10,472
I've taken a good look.
I'm leaving now.

554
00:45:11,073 --> 00:45:15,577
Will you... come back?

555
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,385
Why?

556
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:25,287
Are you afraid that I won't come back?

557
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:27,990
It's because you often don't let
anyone find you for a period of time.

558
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,492
Everybody will be worried.

559
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:33,195
When you travel, please at
least keep in touch with a few...

560
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:35,998
Do you want to go with me?

561
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:39,001
Even if the power to choose
in advance is taken away,

562
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:42,804
in the end, it'll still be the Minister of Personnel's
daughter who'll become the Crown Princess.

563
00:45:42,804 --> 00:45:45,807
At best, you can only become a Yangje.
-= Yangje: The highest of
the Crown Prince's concubines =-

564
00:45:45,807 --> 00:45:50,112
If not, you will be forbidden
to get married forever...

565
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:53,015
and live alone for the rest of your life.

566
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:57,019
If you want to break free from this situation,

567
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:59,922
just in case you wish to,

568
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:06,528
doesn't matter if it's the position of a prince or the
title of Prince Yang Myeong, I'll abandon them all,

569
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,934
and take you far, far away.

570
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:15,938
This joke is not funny.

571
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:21,243
True.

572
00:46:22,044 --> 00:46:24,846
It's not funny.

573
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:32,554
Don't you regret your own choice? Even a bit?

574
00:46:33,355 --> 00:46:35,357
Yes.

575
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:37,459
Then don't think too much.

576
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,461
You will be able to do very well,

577
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:43,565
and directly eliminate
the Minister of Personnel's daughter and others.

578
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:45,667
Do you understand?

579
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,993
I didn't see you at home,

580
00:47:10,993 --> 00:47:15,097
so I knew I could find you here.

581
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:24,006
I heard that she has entered
the final stage of selection.

582
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:31,813
Why didn't you plead with His Majesty?

583
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:34,516
One day,

584
00:47:34,516 --> 00:47:37,920
there was a man named Jeung Sam
who found Confucius.

585
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,223
Master, please praise me.

586
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:44,526
Today, my father hit me without any reason,

587
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:47,829
and I obediently withstood the beating.

588
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:50,532
Don't you think I'm great?

589
00:47:50,532 --> 00:47:54,136
Do you have any idea what Confucius said then?

590
00:47:54,136 --> 00:47:55,837
Ignorant one.

591
00:47:55,837 --> 00:47:59,942
If you were beaten to death, then your father
would become a sinner for killing his own child.

592
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:02,544
How unfilial would that be?

593
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:05,747
When your father hits you without a reason,

594
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,054
you should escape.

595
00:48:16,258 --> 00:48:20,662
So... do you plan to leave?

596
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:23,465
A tree desires to stand still,
but the wind never ceases.

597
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:27,169
What else can I do?

598
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:30,572
It is best to avoid it
before it's broken or chopped off.

599
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:34,576
No... is it the worst solution?

600
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:45,287
But, maybe it's that moon.

601
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:50,692
No matter where I go, she will
most probably follow after me.

602
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:08,911
From the first round of selection to the final round,

603
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:12,114
you all have suffered.

604
00:49:14,716 --> 00:49:17,719
Looks like all of you are too nervous.

605
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:20,923
Even if it is the palace, it is also a place where
people live. You don't need to be too scared.

606
00:49:20,923 --> 00:49:24,026
The best will be selected personally
by you, Your Majesty.

607
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:28,130
It's only natural that they are scared.

608
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:36,238
Today, I have a question to ask you.

609
00:49:36,238 --> 00:49:39,441
I'm the King of Joseon.

610
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:43,445
If you convert my value to money,

611
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:46,448
how much would I worth?

612
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:56,858
Let's have the daughter of
Choi Sang Jin offers her answer first.

613
00:49:56,858 --> 00:49:58,560
What?

614
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:04,566
A hundred thousand yang. No. Ten million yang.

615
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:06,768
Please give me my punishment.

616
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:09,671
I don't understand money that well.

617
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:14,276
I don't know how much would be
considered as a lot of money.

618
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:19,882
So, Yun Dae Hyeong's daughter,
you shall answer.

619
00:50:19,882 --> 00:50:24,987
Your Majesty's virtue is higher than
Mount Tai and wider than the sea.

620
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:29,491
How can we use money to measure?
We might as well convert to gold and pearls.

621
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:31,393
Please allow me to speak boldly.

622
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:36,298
Let's wait until the tools for measuring the
weight of the sky and the depth of the sea appear.

623
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:40,102
When that time comes, please ask me again.

624
00:50:40,102 --> 00:50:43,805
Next is Heo Yeong Jae's daughter's turn to answer.

625
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:48,710
Since Your Majesty has asked, I shall answer.

626
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,513
It's 1 yang.

627
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:11,233
Out.

628
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:14,536
Out.

629
00:51:14,536 --> 00:51:16,638
Your Highness.

630
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:22,444
Your Highness. Your Highness!

631
00:51:22,444 --> 00:51:24,346
How is it?

632
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:28,750
I ask you how is it?

633
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,752
That...

634
00:51:54,776 --> 00:51:57,880
<i>To the impoverished commoners,</i>

635
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,384
<i>there is nothing more precious than 1 yang.</i>

636
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:06,088
<i>People that have 10 000 yang are wealthy
and don't think that 1 yang is precious.</i>

637
00:52:06,088 --> 00:52:12,394
<i>But it's extremely clear to the people who
have nothing, how precious 1 yang is.</i>

638
00:52:12,394 --> 00:52:14,796
<i>To the impoverished commoners,</i>

639
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:20,202
<i>Your Majesty is as practical and as precious as this 1 yang.</i>

640
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:26,909
<i>I beseech Your Majesty to implement policies
that are kind to the common people.</i>

641
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:32,414
How do you feel about being in the palace hall?

642
00:52:32,414 --> 00:52:35,717
This is a daughter-in-law that is really hard to find.

643
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:39,021
What you say is really true.

644
00:52:41,623 --> 00:52:43,325
It's our nation's good fortune.

645
00:52:43,325 --> 00:52:47,930
I was just feeling delighted about the
talents of your father and brother a while ago,

646
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,935
and to think he even had a beautiful and wise daughter
like you. This is truly the blessing of our country.

647
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:58,941
Mother, please also say some
encouraging words to the Crown Princess.

648
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:05,847
What more can an old lady like me say?

649
00:53:05,847 --> 00:53:12,454
Please serve the Crown Prince with utmost sincerity.

650
00:53:12,454 --> 00:53:16,758
I'll always remember it in my heart.

651
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:27,369
I beg of you, Princess. Please eat a little.

652
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:29,671
If you keep doing this,
it won't be good to your royal health.

653
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,373
I have already said that it's not necessary.

654
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:33,275
Why are you doing this?

655
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:36,578
The Queen is worried about you.

656
00:53:36,578 --> 00:53:40,182
She didn't even participate in the
meeting with the Crown Princess.

657
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,584
Crown Princess?

658
00:53:44,186 --> 00:53:46,588
What has that got to do with me?

659
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:50,492
Didn't you like her, Princess?

660
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:52,494
It's...

661
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:55,197
At that time, I thought she would be
my sister-in-law.

662
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:57,699
What?

663
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,803
If she could...

664
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:05,807
why can't I?

665
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:07,609
Take these away quickly.

666
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:10,312
I am going to go on a hunger strike.

667
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,923
What happened?

668
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:30,132
Come. Don't cry and tell Mother about it.

669
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:37,039
Mother. Please plead Father for me.

670
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,142
If it's not that person, I will die.

671
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:44,446
You dare to be so indecent in front of your mother.

672
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:47,349
I've already told you not to mention him again.

673
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:49,952
But I want to.

674
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:55,057
Royal Father, brother, Yeon U.
I hate all of them.

675
00:54:55,057 --> 00:54:58,060
I also dislike you, Mother.

676
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:04,666
Princess!  Princess!

677
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:15,277
Grandmother,
please help me beg His Majesty.

678
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:21,083
Let Teacher Heo become my husband.

679
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,685
What exactly is the matter?

680
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:25,187
Please help me.

681
00:55:25,187 --> 00:55:26,388
I am very sorry, Mother.

682
00:55:26,388 --> 00:55:27,689
Grandmother.

683
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:32,794
- Don't just stand there. Help the
Princess return to her room quickly.
- I beg you. Please help me.

684
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:37,499
- I beg you. Please help me, Grandmother.
- Princess. Princess. Please stand.

685
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:42,004
Grandmother.
Grandmother, I beg you.

686
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:47,409
Grandmother. I beg you, Grandmother.

687
00:56:14,836 --> 00:56:16,538
Head Shaman.

688
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,441
What is the matter?

689
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:23,545
News has arrive asking you to secretly
go to the Queen Dowager's palace tonight.

690
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:34,256
This place is called Secret Moon Pavilion.

691
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:40,862
Because you are not married yet, you
cannot live in the Crown Princess's palace.

692
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:46,168
The Crown Princess's palace should actually be
situated between the palace and your private home.

693
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:52,074
But His Majesty has chosen this
Secret Moon Pavilion especially for you.

694
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:57,279
This is also one of the most beautiful places in the palace.

695
00:56:57,279 --> 00:56:59,281
Yes.

696
00:56:59,281 --> 00:57:03,986
True to its name, this is an extremely beautiful place.

697
00:57:03,986 --> 00:57:06,688
Please don't use polite language to me.

698
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:08,090
What?

699
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:14,096
I understand.

700
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:23,305
From tomorrow onwards, for the wedding
you'll start the Seupui.
-=Seupui - A practice in advance for the future
national ceremony that'll be held=-

701
00:57:23,305 --> 00:57:28,110
You better go to sleep early today.

702
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,711
And this.

703
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:36,518
This handkerchief is...

704
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:39,521
You will need it.

705
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:45,527
Then I shall take my leave first.
Please rest well.

706
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:19,661
Mother.

707
00:58:33,976 --> 00:58:37,279
That's why you said I will need it.

708
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,006
Are you crying because you left your family?

709
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:07,609
If so, open the window and take a look.

710
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:22,424
Your Highness.

711
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:25,227
Did I scare you?

712
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:27,329
It is forbidden to enter this side of the palace.

713
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:29,131
Why are you here?

714
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:31,733
I bribed someone.

715
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:36,438
Wait.

716
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:38,540
Yeon U, can you wait for a moment?

717
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,242
Please go back.

718
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:45,547
Your Highness will become an example
for the people, the country's foundation...

719
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,567
Your Highness.

720
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,989
Have you finished crying?

721
01:00:26,989 --> 01:00:28,390
Your Highness.

722
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:31,193
I've received special permission from His Majesty.

723
01:00:31,193 --> 01:00:34,096
Don't worry.

724
01:00:44,606 --> 01:00:47,809
I prepared this Kouji just for you.
-= Kouji: a type of play where one person
imitates many kinds of voice to entertain audience =-

725
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:51,713
Since we can't sleep tonight anyway,

726
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:54,216
let us enjoy it together.

727
01:01:40,762 --> 01:01:42,864
This is a hastily prepared performance.

728
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:47,669
Please show compassion even
if the performance is lacking.

729
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,574
Begin.

730
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:22,504
What did you just say?

731
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:27,309
The Princess Successor has changed,
so I am asking you to remove her.

732
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:30,112
The King has already increased the
security at the Crown Princess' palace.

733
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:33,815
It's impossible to assassinate or poison her.

734
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:38,720
Only you can do the job without getting close to her.

735
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,725
My existence is to pray for good
fortune of the royal family.

736
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:46,028
Since she has become the Princess Successor,

737
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:49,331
she is already part of the royal family.

738
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:53,135
The situation looks bad for the
Celestial Hall right now, doesn't it?

739
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:56,138
The scholars are repeatedly asking for
the Celestial Hall to be demolished.

740
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:58,740
In fact, it is barely surviving.

741
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,643
If I no longer to provide a buffer...

742
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:04,947
What do you think will happen in the end?

743
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,448
Are you threatening me now?

744
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:07,249
This is an order.

745
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:08,450
That person is the Princess Successor.

746
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:11,954
She will not be the Princess Successor
anymore after you have killed her.

747
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:19,261
You said repeatedly that the Minister of Personnel's
daughter will become the owner of the Hall of Union.

748
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:25,067
You must be responsible for what you've said.

749
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:29,371
Use your black magic

750
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,775
and kill that child, Heo Yeon U.

751
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,693
<i>So it's actually me, A Ri.</i>

752
01:03:55,597 --> 01:04:00,102
<i>The person who will cause that child to die...</i>

753
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:03,005
<i>...is actually me.</i>

754
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:06,708
<i>Please tell me, A Ri.</i>

755
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:09,912
<i>What should I do?</i>

756
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,218
<i>That child or the Celestial Hall...</i>

757
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:21,323
<i>Of the two, which should I protect?</i>

758
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:14,476
Father,

759
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:17,579
the reason I came to find the Crown Princess today...

760
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:21,884
<i>Although going near the
sun will attract disaster,</i>

761
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:26,388
<i>fate will force her to stand by
the sun's side and protect him.</i>

762
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:39,001
<i>Really...  must I really kill her,</i>

763
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,403
<i>the Crown Princess?</i>

764
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
-=Two, People, Labor=-
