1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,802
Child, it's time... for you to go back.

2
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,412
It was hard for me to accept that I can't
come all the way with you,

3
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:55,115
so please don't stop me coming
on board to see you off.

4
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:08,128
Why are you like this?

5
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:11,131
If there are people looking for you,
while I am not around...

6
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:13,433
You have to hide yourself.

7
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,435
Are there any guests coming to visit today?

8
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:19,840
You must not open your
heart to anyone,

9
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,142
or form any attachment to anyone.

10
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,844
Do you understand me?

11
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:31,651
Oh, the boat has arrived.

12
00:01:57,878 --> 00:01:59,179
Did you sleep well?

13
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:02,883
Although the ride was a bit rough,
you still managed to sleep soundly.

14
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:09,289
But is there a market today?

15
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,691
How come there are so many
people here today?

16
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:16,196
You didn't know?

17
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:19,699
His Majesty is going to visit
this village today.

18
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,303
Therefore, a number of people
have gathered just to see His Majesty.

19
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:26,006
If you didn't know,
then today is your lucky day.

20
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:29,309
You are so lucky. Very lucky!

21
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,711
<i>Yeon U, did you...</i>

22
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:35,015
<i>...want me to meet His Majesty?</i>

23
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:11,551
When you have reached there,
please give my regards to the monk.

24
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:15,555
Seol, escort her back home immediately.

25
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:18,458
Oh please. I'm sick of hearing
the same thing again.

26
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,060
If you don't trust me that much,

27
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,461
why don't you leave her here
and take me instead?

28
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,963
Compared to your obstinacy,

29
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:24,965
her mouth is more dangerous,
so I'm taking her.

30
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:26,967
This is nothing to be envious about.

31
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,975
The person who nags all the time is not here.

32
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:36,977
Let's have something to eat
and then go back.

33
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:41,882
This isn't an ordinary Uimakche.
-= Uimakche: a permit for putting up a tent along
the road in order to watch the royal procession =-

34
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:45,285
The venue you've been waiting for
is now here!

35
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,989
The chance to see his Majesty's
dragon colors up close...

36
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,193
You can't touch this...

37
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:58,798
To be able to watch His Majesty's royal
procession from the most comfortable position,

38
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,600
this is an excellent opportunity.

39
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:02,802
You cannot!

40
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:10,010
- We really cannot.
- Everybody take a look.

41
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,812
No, just pretend it doesn't exist.

42
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:15,415
Seol...

43
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:16,616
Where are you going?

44
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:17,918
No, forget it.

45
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:19,819
Take this one.

46
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,122
I already gave you one.

47
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:25,025
Don't worry.
Just believe me...

48
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:34,534
Reliable news! His Majesty has already
reached the entrance of the village.

49
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:37,637
Give me one, give me one...

50
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,541
I know, I know...

51
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,363
We are already near the village,
so lift the curtain.

52
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:07,667
Your Majesty, the weather is very cold...

53
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,669
I said lift it.

54
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,871
Stop!

55
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:13,874
Set down the palanquin!

56
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,988
Despite the cold, there are many people
who are gathered here in order to catch
a glimpse of me,

57
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,890
how can I let them be disappointed?

58
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,493
Then Your Majesty,
please show a kind expression,

59
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:36,496
or smile a bit.

60
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:41,301
Yue Seo Si overturned her Kingdom with
her frivolous smile and good looks.

61
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:45,705
True beauty cannot be masked by a frown.

62
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:50,310
Do you think it's easy for
a king to look like this?

63
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:56,516
Do you want to stay here?
Pick up the pace!

64
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:59,119
Lift the palanquin!

65
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:18,438
We agreed, only one glance.

66
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,240
Just a moment and then leave.

67
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,442
I know it already. Don't be so worried.

68
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,045
You can go.

69
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,548
We live in a nearby village.

70
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:30,650
My child wants to take
a look at His Majesty.

71
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,953
No. Go back. Next one.

72
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,554
Officer, please, just this once...

73
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,156
This sister...

74
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,458
If you want to take a look at
His Majesty on his long journey,

75
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,561
you must at least wear clothes made of silk.

76
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:42,562
You can't.

77
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,564
Officer, please, just this once...

78
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:46,266
This woman, really...

79
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,278
Isn't that too harsh to a weak woman?

80
00:06:58,278 --> 00:06:59,479
What?

81
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,781
Do poor, low-class people...

82
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:04,384
...not have the right to see
His Majesty in person?

83
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,087
Where is that rule written?

84
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:09,289
This girl...

85
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:10,790
Who are you?

86
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,092
What do you do? You wretch...

87
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:13,894
Shaman!

88
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:17,998
A lowly shaman...

89
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,901
dares to stare at me and talk
impertinently?

90
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,802
I ought to...

91
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:25,805
Before I chop this hand off,
put it down quickly.

92
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:27,607
What is this?

93
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,210
Are you her man?

94
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,114
You sure look like a woman though.

95
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:37,517
Why? Having a shaman by your side,
makes you feel confident?

96
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,319
Are you that  proud?

97
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:46,926
Do you want me to tell you
why your wife ran away from home?

98
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:48,929
What?

99
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:51,531
It's because you beat your
wife with those hands.

100
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:54,234
You drink and return
home to hit your wife.

101
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:57,838
You deserved it when she ran
away with a younger man.

102
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:01,241
Hey, did your wife run away from
home because she found someone better?

103
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,242
Didn't you say that your wife
returned to her parental home?

104
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:03,844
Who said she's found someone better?

105
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:05,245
You still dare to open your mouth?

106
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:08,448
You feel sick whenever you eat
and  even throw up acid, right?

107
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:11,151
Only drinking will make you
forget all the pain,

108
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:13,353
so you're bound to substitute
every meal with wine.

109
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:15,755
The illness in your stomach and intestines
is already serious.

110
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:18,458
If you don't stop drinking immediately,

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,362
I'm afraid that you'll go
to an early grave.

112
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:24,664
At most you won't last more than a year.

113
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:27,167
You! You... this woman!

114
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,368
Let her go.

115
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:30,070
Nothing good will come from
provoking a shaman,

116
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,872
if she uses her magic and destroys
you, what are you going to do?

117
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:37,978
Hey over there,
do you want to die?

118
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:38,979
Stop right there!

119
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,981
Stop!

120
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:46,386
Hurry go inside.

121
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:07,607
Agassi, why did you show
your shaman identity again?
(Agassi - young lady)

122
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:10,911
Didn't Master tell you not to be like that?

123
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,213
I am a shaman, I'm just doing
what a shaman should do.

124
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:14,814
What problem could she have?

125
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:17,117
You don't even have powers,
and you're acting like a shaman already.

126
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:19,319
You deceived him.

127
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,821
But, you don't have any ability.

128
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,324
How did you know that his
wife ran away with another man?

129
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,626
I didn't use magic, that was logic.

130
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,228
Eh?

131
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,831
In the middle of broad daylight, his
mouth has the stench of alcohol.

132
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:33,333
And his nose is red
because he's drunk.

133
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:35,035
Therefore, he must be a fellow
who is addicted to alcohol.

134
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,237
Ah...

135
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:39,840
He responded aggressively
to such a small matter.

136
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,042
And seeing how violent he
is towards women,

137
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,144
you can tell that he's a violent drunkard

138
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:46,646
and I'm sure he's not very different at home.

139
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:50,650
But you can't be sure that
his wife ran away from home.

140
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,953
His body shows that no woman
is taking care of him at home.

141
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:56,056
The holes on his clothes are big
yet they haven't been mended.

142
00:09:56,156 --> 00:10:00,360
And most importantly, when he saw
such a fine and pretty young man,

143
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,462
he seemed especially angry.

144
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:06,666
A man?
Are you talking about me?

145
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:13,273
So I'm sure that his wife
ran away with a young man.

146
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:17,277
Seeing him so angry means
that it must be a recent matter.

147
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:19,679
Then, regarding the stomach and
intestine matters, how could you see it?

148
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,582
It's obvious that he is an alcoholic.

149
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:25,285
His wife had run away from home.
He would be drinking more.

150
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:28,989
His mouth has a very strong peculiar smell,
so there must be something wrong with his stomach.

151
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,894
You should just use your logic
and be a fortune teller.

152
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:37,597
But, the way you warned him that time.
Why were you being so fierce?

153
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:38,999
Agassi, it's not like you.

154
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,501
Whenever there is a problem, he only
knows how to drink and hit people.

155
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,803
He brought it all on himself.

156
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:45,906
I feel bad for his situation,

157
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:48,608
but, unless he receives a severe
warning, he won't sober up.

158
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:52,412
Why else would his wife be unable to
bear it and run away during the night?

159
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,815
Don't run! Stop there!

160
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,919
- Hey You!
- Stop right there!

161
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:03,423
Hold on! Hold on!

162
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:04,724
Let's put this down and just talk.

163
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:06,226
Brat, come here!

164
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:07,527
Wait, wait!

165
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:09,229
Your personalities!

166
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,031
Let's talk instead, talk!

167
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:13,133
His Majesty is here!

168
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,541
I'll be back to straighten you out.

169
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,453
Do not look anymore.
Hurry, pay your respects.

170
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:13,854
~ <i>As the light dims by the clouds, ~

171

00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:44,384
~ <i>Lost in longing that grows stronger
and stronger, ~

176
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:51,091
~ <i>is there no way to turn back time? ~

177
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:54,444
~ <i>Just this one time,</i> ~

178
00:13:54,444 --> 00:13:57,797
~ <i>even if it's the last...</i> ~

179
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,900
~ <i>Everything else won't matter</i> ~

180
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:05,205
Agassi... Agassi!

181
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:13,914
Seize her!

182
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:16,116
Silence!

183
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:19,219
Seize her now!

184
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,821
Move away.

185
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:22,923
Catch her!

186
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:26,126
Catch her.

187
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,231
What happened?

188
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:35,135
Apparently a woman caused a disturbance
when she broke protocol and stood up.

189
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,436
A woman?

190
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:37,237
Yes.

191
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:40,240
To protect Your Majesty from this outlaw,
we have sent guards to chase her.

192
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,343
I'll be putting down the curtain.

193
00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:58,358
Catch them!

194
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,960
Catch them!

195
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,262
Hurry chase them!

196
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:04,464
Hurry, catch her!

197
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:29,789
Catch them!

198
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,491
Catch them!

199
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:32,092
Hurry, catch her!

200
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:36,396
Hurry, catch her!

201
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:43,403
Agassi, are you out of your mind?

202
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:45,405
How could you look directly
at His Majesty's face?

203
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:46,406
Seol.

204
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:47,707
What?

205
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,810
Was there a time when you and I
were chased like this before?

206
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:53,113
Have we ever been chased
by people in the past?

207
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,115
If we had experienced something
like this before...

208
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,417
do you think we'd still be alive?

209
00:15:57,517 --> 00:15:59,920
But this feeling...

210
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:06,626
reminds me of someone...

211
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:30,851
Ah... I'm sorry.

212
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:35,355
I got the wrong person.

213
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:40,660
What am I expecting?

214
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:42,962
She is dead.

215
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:47,868
Buried underground.

216
00:16:56,676 --> 00:17:00,280
Why are you like this, Your Majesty?

217
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,785
Is the water temperature
not comfortable for you?

218
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:10,690
Does the herb's smell not please you?

219
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,092
If not, then...

220
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,593
It's annoying.

221
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:14,594
What?

222
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:17,898
Something is annoying me.

223
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,004
Hyeong Seon, I'm not talking about you.

224
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:29,309
Then, what is making you dissatisfied?

225
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,411
The silk clothes.

226
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:33,713
The satin shoes.

227
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,916
Clean faces.

228
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:37,017
What?

229
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:41,221
Everyone was clean and neatly
dressed with elegant clothes.

230
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:45,325
You couldn't see anyone who looked poor.

231
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:48,929
Even a dog by the roadside
looked plump.

232
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:51,932
Such a peaceful and prosperous country.

233
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:54,134
I must truly be a wise king.

234
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:58,738
That must be because they only
showed you the good things.

235
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,344
Do you think that I come all the way
to Won Yang just to see the wealthy?

236
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:09,049
Your Majesty, you came here to get better.

237
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,451
You should try to forget what you saw...

238
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:12,853
Un.

239
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,054
Please give me your orders.

240
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:18,058
I feel better after having a hot bath.

241
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:21,261
You must be tired after such
a long and difficult journey.

242
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:26,166
Why don't you join me?

243
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,969
Gin... ginseng.

244
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:34,474
Go out bring more ginseng
and herbs for the bath.

245
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:42,182
Your Majesty, there has been many
rumors circulating in the palace.

246
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:45,185
Why are you joking this way?

247
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:48,388
Rumors?
What rumors?

248
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:50,690
Your Majesty has been keeping
your distance from the Queen,

249
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,492
and only keeps Un by your side,

250
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:55,896
so rumor has it that you
are a man who lov...

251
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:57,797
Man!

252
00:18:57,998 --> 00:18:59,399
Love between men.

253
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,101
Regardless of rumors...

254
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:05,805
I beg you, please do not joke with Un
like this anymore.

255
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:09,009
Perhaps...

256
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:13,313
Hyeong Seon, do you want
to join me in the bath?

257
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:23,723
I... I have to go and see
if the medicine is ready.

258
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,136
Ah, Finally...

259
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:42,642
...we are alone again.

260
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:49,649
It can't be true! It can't be true!
It can't be true!

261
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:52,352
All these years serving His Majesty,

262
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,654
has His Majesty changed his 'preference'?

263
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:56,156
God Forbid!

264
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,457
My heart is beating so hard,

265
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,259
and my legs are trembling.

266
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,560
Why am I like this?

267
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,262
What should I do?

268
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:10,170
Do you need to use the restroom?

269
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,373
Why are you acting like a puppy
who doesn't know what to do?

270
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:16,276
Prince Yang Myeong.

271
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:22,682
<i>Your Majesty, Prince Yang Myeong
would like to see you.</i>

272
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:29,389
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

273
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:33,994
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

274
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:40,200
Your Majesty.<i>

275
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,503
Your Majesty!

276
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:47,507
Is there something wrong?

277
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:53,914
It looks like Hyeong Seon's scream
has reached all the way here.

278
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:14,034
From what I saw earlier,

279
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:17,237
it's completely different.

280
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:26,046
Please give me some money.
Please give me some money.

281
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:30,350
My Lord, please give me some money.
Please give me some money.

282
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:34,354
My Lord, My Lord, please.

283
00:21:43,763 --> 00:21:45,065
I am sorry, Sir.

284
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:47,367
I am really sorry.

285
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,675
You seem to be in a rush.
Where are you going?

286
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,777
My sister is at home all by herself.

287
00:21:57,978 --> 00:22:01,982
I want to bring this to her.

288
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:06,887
Don't you have parents?

289
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:10,590
My mother died 2 years ago
of plague,

290
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,095
and a month ago, my father was forced
to build the Boyeong Palace.

291
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,497
After that, we lost contact.

292
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:20,700
Are you sure it's the Boyeong Palace?

293
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:33,013
What is your father's name?

294
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:37,817
You just have to say Pi Han Do
of Yang Ji Won Yang.

295
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:40,720
I will definitely look for your father
and release him so he can return home.

296
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:44,925
You must take good care of your sister.

297
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,528
This kid, you don't believe me.

298
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:51,731
My people are influential and have high status.

299
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:52,933
Thank you very much, Sir.

300
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,235
Thank you very much!

301
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:03,143
Your Majesty.

302
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:04,845
What?

303
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:06,646
There is a Ganja.
-= Ganja : Spy =-

304
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,949
I know!

305
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:12,752
He's probably a gift from the Minister.

306
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:13,854
Un.

307
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:16,056
Yes, Your Majesty.

308
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,860
It's praiseworthy that he was able
to follow us all the way here.

309
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,864
Let's play a game with him.

310
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,382
We have probably lost him by now.

311
00:23:45,986 --> 00:23:49,289
I am curious to know what will happen next.
What do you think?

312
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:52,392
Maybe they are secretly training private soldiers.

313
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:55,495
Are they joining their power
with the senior ministers in secret?

314
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,398
I think Minister will be quite frustrated.

315
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:01,701
Let's end our private visit here.

316
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:04,104
Fine, then.

317
00:24:04,204 --> 00:24:07,707
We should stop now.

318
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:14,014
It's Yeon U.

319
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:19,719
You have come to visit me,
haven't you, Yeon U?

320
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:38,839
Your Majesty!

321
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,941
Your Majesty!

322
00:24:42,142 --> 00:24:47,848
If we are destined to meet, surely we will.

323
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:51,551
Didn't I say before,

324
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:54,154
the magic that was cast,
will be as strong as the memory.

325
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:59,960
So, must you insist on calling me out on
the day His Majesty is setting off?

326
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,064
His Majesty's illness isn't a small matter.

327
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:08,368
The person who should be protecting His Majesty
is living in another life.

328
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:10,971
That's why His Majesty's health
has never improved.

329
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:14,674
Are you thinking of helping both of them
to fulfill their destiny together?

330
00:25:14,674 --> 00:25:19,479
This is not a matter for humans,
it will be decided by God.

331
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,481
The fate of those two will never
be interfered with by humans.

332
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:24,584
You are also aware of it, aren't you?

333
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:28,488
Their fate to be together has already ended.

334
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:32,092
But all of their memories haven't.

335
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:35,795
Agassi has already forgotten all of her past.

336
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:39,799
She is no longer concerned with the past.

337
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,303
She will eventually recover her memory one day.

338
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:45,105
This is bound to lead to bloodshed.

339
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:51,411
This is an inverse act of fate,
the price must be paid.

340
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:56,216
Then, she will fall again into this cruel fate.

341
00:25:57,317 --> 00:26:01,922
This type of pain, how can we let her
experience it again for the second time?

342
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:31,551
Agassi, what are you thinking about?

343
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:34,855
Seol.

344
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:36,857
I figured it out.

345
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,458
What?

346
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,760
What did you figure out?

347
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,763
I know whose memories those are.

348
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:49,970
Those are... his memories.

349
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:52,672
What?

350
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:57,878
I read that person's memory and sadness.

351
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:04,584
Do you understand what I'm saying?

352
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:08,688
Now I can also have visions.

353
00:27:11,091 --> 00:27:16,997
Now I've truly become a real shaman.

354
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:22,002
About that agassi...
saying that is rather...

355
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:27,908
Where are you going?

356
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:31,411
The Head Shaman has not returned yet.

357
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:33,713
I should go out and see.

358
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:35,815
Let's go together, Agassi.

359
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:54,534
The fog is so thick.
Looks like we have lost our way.

360
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:59,039
From the start, we've been
going around in circles.

361
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,342
I'm sorry.

362
00:28:03,143 --> 00:28:06,046
Why are you feeling sorry?

363
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:11,251
It is my fault that we are lost.

364
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:26,967
Is it the moon?

365
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,186
I have been waiting for you.

366
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:49,789
Why did you just come now?

367
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:46,847
Miss, don't you know who they are?

368
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,349
It seems like they are having a private visit.

369
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:51,251
We will just pretend we don't know.

370
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:55,255
Then, why did you bring them here
if you do know who they are?

371
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:58,859
Then is it right for me to see them lose their way,
and do nothing to help them?

372
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:00,460
The Head Shaman warned you
repeatedly in the past

373
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,662
that if you see strangers
you must avoid them.

374
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:06,166
But she has never said that I must
refuse those who needed help.

375
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,205
The warm wine can help both of you
from feeling cold.

376
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:51,111
This table was only set for one person,

377
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,713
so we haven't prepared anything else.

378
00:30:55,215 --> 00:30:57,517
I'm so sorry.

379
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,423
So please do not mind our humble home.

380
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:10,130
Please sit here for a moment.

381
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:15,335
Who is the owner of this table?

382
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:20,240
Were you waiting for someone in the rain?

383
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:32,853
Were you waiting for someone?

384
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,064
I was waiting for my Godmother.

385
00:31:44,264 --> 00:31:48,468
I was waiting for my Godmother to return.

386
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:54,975
If there are no other requests,
I shall take my leave.

387
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,577
Did you say you are a shaman?

388
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:00,080
Yes.

389
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,083
How could this be a female shaman's house?

390
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:08,488
Or do you have unusual interests?

391
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:12,192
Do all of these books belong to you?

392
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:14,394
Yes.

393
00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:17,497
A female shaman who reads the Four Books
and Five Classics.

394
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:20,200
You truly have a noble interest.

395
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,204
But what's the use of a female shaman
reading the Confucian classics?

396
00:32:24,204 --> 00:32:29,809
I read them to understand
the way of the world.

397
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:32,112
That's the reason.

398
00:32:32,112 --> 00:32:36,016
You read them to understand
the way of the world?

399
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:39,619
Even if you understand
the way of the world,

400
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,821
what will you gain?

401
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:45,625
Although I'm just an ordinary
female shaman,

402
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,428
I don't read just for personal gain,

403
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:52,532
but in the hope of helping others.

404
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,937
Besides, after reading the
words of the ancients,

405
00:32:56,937 --> 00:33:01,141
we can feel joy from understanding
the truth within.

406
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:03,844
Therefore, I cannot stop reading.

407
00:33:04,744 --> 00:33:10,050
<i>A gentleman doesn't complain against
heaven and bear grudges against people.</i>

408
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,351
<i>You read the Analects of Confucius?</i>

409
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:18,458
<i>The farmers do not blame the farm.
The musicians never blame their instruments.</i>

410
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,560
<i>This is impossible.</i>

411
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,263
<i>She is already dead.
She can't be alive.</i>

412
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:27,868
<i>This woman only resembles her.</i>

413
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:32,571
What's the matter?

414
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:36,076
<i>This is a dream.
It's an illusion.</i>

415
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:41,181
<i>My dream is being staged in reality,
and it's deceiving me.</i>

416
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:54,794
You drink too.

417
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:59,198
It's all right. Just drink.

418
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,002
Didn't you get caught in the rain too?

419
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:05,906
You are really a disloyal man.

420
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:08,808
You don't know who I am,

421
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:11,711
and you don't know what is in this wine.

422
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:14,915
How can you refuse to smell it?
-=Smell, to taste the meal before
the King to distinguish if the food is poisoned=-

423
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:18,018
Do you only use sword to protect the King?

424
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:25,725
How did you know?

425
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:27,928
What do you mean?

426
00:34:27,928 --> 00:34:35,035
How did you know that I am
the King of Joseon?

427
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:45,145
<i>Your soul remains in this world.</i>

428
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:49,649
<i>Do you want to see His Majesty?</i>

429
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:54,754
<i>Even if you don't come to see me,</i>

430
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:58,358
<i>I am still very  happy.</i>

431
00:35:05,165 --> 00:35:11,171
<i>However, please be sure to
look for me in the next life.</i>

432
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:17,777
You have seen me before, haven't you?

433
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm just a lowly female shaman.

434
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,782
It's impossible for me to have
met you, Your Majesty.

435
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:23,984
Don't lie to me!

436
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:27,487
How could I dare to deceive Your Majesty?

437
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:31,992
Then, are you really a shaman?

438
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:34,594
After receiving heavenly force
in my childhood,

439
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:37,497
I have been living as a shaman.

440
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:41,201
If you don't call a person who has received
heavenly force a shaman,

441
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:44,204
then what would you call her?

442
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:49,009
How did you know that I am
the King of this country?

443
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:50,810
It is because...

444
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,613
Tell me now!

445
00:35:56,216 --> 00:35:58,919
Please forgive me for not telling you.

446
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,623
I happened to see you today while
Your Majesty was on your trip.

447
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:28,548
Please instruct me.

448
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:31,251
The rain has stopped.

449
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:34,955
It is time...

450
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:39,159
We should leave.

451
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:12,893
What is your name?

452
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:16,196
I'm sorry.

453
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:19,699
I don't have a name.

454
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,803
Even if you are a shaman, how is it
possible that you don't have a name?

455
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:26,706
It is said that I must not be bound by fate.

456
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:29,309
So my Godmother didn't give me a name.

457
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:34,814
People usually call me Agi.
(Agi: short form of Agassi - young lady)

458
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:40,420
Because you must not be bound by fate,
you weren't given a name.

459
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:47,327
This brief encounter can be considered as fate.

460
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:55,635
I want to give you a name "Wol".
-=Wol: Moon=-

461
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:05,445
This is to repay you for your warm wine.

462
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:09,549
'Wol'.

463
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:14,654
Are you listening?

464
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:17,557
From now on I...

465
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:21,361
...have a name.

466
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:38,778
Your Majesty.

467
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,380
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

468
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,982
Do you want to see me...

469
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:43,383
I don't want to hear it.

470
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:45,585
Therefore, don't say it again.

471
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:48,488
How exactly did you protect His Majesty?

472
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:49,990
He protected me well.

473
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,093
That's why I came back safely.

474
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:08,708
Your Majesty...

475
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,810
How have you been all these years?

476
00:39:14,014 --> 00:39:16,316
What are you doing here?

477
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:19,819
You appear suddenly after so many years.

478
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,123
Were you reluctant to see me for a while?

479
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,732
You are still as good looking as ever.

480
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:06,466
Un, come over and sit with us.

481
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:08,468
Don't mind your servant...

482
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,071
Just give it up.

483
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:15,675
While on duty, he will not
touch even a drop of alcohol.

484
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:18,478
So, do you want a bet with me?

485
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:19,279
What bet?

486
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:23,283
The person who can make Un drink
will have his wish fulfilled.

487
00:40:24,184 --> 00:40:25,185
Did you hear that?

488
00:40:26,186 --> 00:40:28,188
This isn't the appropriate
time to discuss it,

489
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:31,291
but after I've received gold and
treasure from His Majesty,

490
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:34,294
I will definitely give you half of it.

491
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:37,497
Take a look.

492
00:40:37,898 --> 00:40:40,600
He is not adorable at all.

493
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:42,702
Un.

494
00:40:42,702 --> 00:40:44,304
Please give me your order.

495
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:47,407
Come over here and have a drink.

496
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,010
This is a royal command.

497
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:14,734
Hyeongnim.
(Hyeongnim - respected older brother)

498
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,736
Okay, I lost.

499
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:21,741
In return, you can ask me anything.

500
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:27,347
Even now,

501
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:35,355
do you still think about her?

502
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:40,160
Please answer me.

503
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:43,663
Your Majesty.

504
00:41:43,964 --> 00:41:46,366
You lost to me, didn't you?

505
00:41:46,867 --> 00:41:49,669
Now I would like you to honor that wish.

506
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,274
Even if she were still in my heart,

507
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:58,478
she would still be dead.

508
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:05,585
When I say I'll forget her,
I remember her.

509
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:07,187
And when I want to think about her,

510
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,891
I just as quickly forget her.
That is the human heart.

511
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:16,296
I do not want to forget,
but I am more reluctant to remember.

512
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,903
In the end,
I decided to remember...

513
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:26,806
that she is no longer in this world.

514
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:36,316
Choose to remember
that she is no longer in this world.

515
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,621
So, that's the case.

516
00:43:06,446 --> 00:43:09,950
During the time that I'm not in the palace,
my ministers have been working hard.

517
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,053
The Minister of Taxation has been
especially outstanding.

518
00:43:13,053 --> 00:43:14,154
Although it's insignificant,

519
00:43:14,154 --> 00:43:16,256
it's to reduce the burden on Your Majesty.

520
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:17,757
The Officials are awake at night

521
00:43:17,757 --> 00:43:19,960
just to handle the political issues.

522
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,961
Very well said.

523
00:43:21,761 --> 00:43:25,165
Such things are of little significance.

524
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:28,268
Might as well have a good sleep,
don't you think?

525
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:31,171
Especially this...

526
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:33,673
The renovation work on
the Boyeong Palace

527
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:36,877
has already added an extra
three thousand coal.

528
00:43:36,877 --> 00:43:38,378
This is still not enough,

529
00:43:38,378 --> 00:43:40,881
and there's a request for next year's
payment in advance.

530
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:45,485
Isn't this evidence that you are forcing
the commoners to die?

531
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:47,587
There may be some difficulties now,

532
00:43:47,587 --> 00:43:48,989
but the time limit for the
project is urgent.

533
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,290
What is the rush?

534
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,693
This is the pavilion that is most cherished
by the Great Queen Dowager.

535
00:43:53,693 --> 00:43:56,196
It's best to shorten the construction period,

536
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:58,698
and finish it on time
for the Queen's birthday next year.

537
00:43:58,698 --> 00:44:03,103
Ah... so the birthday present is more pressing
than the life or death of the common people.

538
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:06,106
This matter has already been permitted
by Your Majesty.

539
00:44:06,106 --> 00:44:07,507
I did grant you that permission.

540
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:08,408
But...

541
00:44:08,408 --> 00:44:12,312
I did not ask you to force unpaid labor
on the common people in the harsh winter.

542
00:44:12,312 --> 00:44:14,915
Even fathers need to earn money
for their starving children

543
00:44:14,915 --> 00:44:16,917
but they were forced over here.

544
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:19,019
Did I say to do that?

545
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:20,520
But, Your Majesty...

546
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,522
The size of the project is too large.

547
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:23,123
Manpower...

548
00:44:23,123 --> 00:44:25,725
But what I'm most curious about is,

549
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:30,730
in the end, why was so much charcoal used?

550
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,733
There were a large number people forced
into labor just for this construction.

551
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:37,437
Where have all these people gone to?

552
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:38,939
What have you got to say?

553
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:45,445
Before retreating from this hall,
list all names of the construction workers,

554
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:48,748
the project schedule, and the funding details.

555
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:51,351
And then, give the details to me.

556
00:44:52,152 --> 00:44:57,657
I will personally review the accounts tomorrow.

557
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:18,678
Sir, are you looking for me?

558
00:45:21,882 --> 00:45:25,986
How many years has it been since
you returned to to the Celestial Hall?

559
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:26,786
What?

560
00:45:26,786 --> 00:45:30,490
I am asking you, how many years has it been

561
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,592
since you took over
Head Shaman Jang's position?

562
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:36,296
Next year will be my eighth year.

563
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:45,305
I am thinking of looking for an opportunity
to confer the title of Head Shaman
of Celestial Hall upon you.

564
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:50,210
I will never forget your generous benefaction.

565
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,113
Just order whatever you want,
no matter what it is.

566
00:45:53,813 --> 00:46:01,021
But, you seem to be unconcerned
about His Majesty's health.

567
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:04,925
I heard that His Majesty has been well
without problems...

568
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:06,826
Isn't that right?

569
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:09,629
That is why I am worried.

570
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,033
When he needs to be healthy, he falls ill.

571
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:17,137
When he needs to be ill, he is healthy.

572
00:46:18,638 --> 00:46:24,744
While the King was gone,
I planted a talisman at the Palace Hall.

573
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:29,749
When you order it, we'll be able to
see the effects immediately.

574
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:33,353
Tomorrow...

575
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:40,560
I'm already worried when I think about
having to pay my respects to the unwell King.

576
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:07,587
<i>I am only an ordinary female shaman.</i>

577
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:11,291
<i>How could I dare to implicate His Majesty?</i>

578
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:15,195
<i>Your Majesty, it's Seon Hyeong.</i>

579
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:16,196
Come in.

580
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:27,407
Your Majesty, the Queen asked for an audience.

581
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:31,111
I've ordered you to not let anyone in.
Don't tell me you've already forgotten.

582
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:40,120
Your Majesty, I beg you.

583
00:47:42,022 --> 00:47:43,323
Your Majesty!

584
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:50,230
Let her come in.

585
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:54,634
Hurry, invite her in. Hurry!

586
00:48:06,947 --> 00:48:08,849
Welcome, my Queen.

587
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,752
How is your health, Your Majesty?

588
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:14,855
As you can see, I am very sturdy.

589
00:48:15,155 --> 00:48:18,959
What is so important that the Queen
needs to come here at such a late hour?

590
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,972
What did you just say?

591
00:48:32,372 --> 00:48:34,674
I ask Your Majesty to leave an heir.

592
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:42,582
You are an ambitious monarch.

593
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:48,188
Without the power of a successor,
you are merely a tower in a desert.

594
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:53,493
You must leave behind a royal heir
to consolidate your legacy.

595
00:48:54,294 --> 00:48:55,495
My Queen.

596
00:48:55,795 --> 00:49:01,401
I can't face the Queen Dowager ever again.

597
00:49:02,202 --> 00:49:05,005
It doesn't matter if it's from a concubine.

598
00:49:05,205 --> 00:49:08,808
Please take a concubine to have a royal heir.

599
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,711
Are you being sincere?

600
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:18,218
As the Queen of this country, how can
one be swayed by personal feelings?

601
00:49:18,218 --> 00:49:19,519
True enough...

602
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:29,429
Now I know why you receive so much
love and respect from everyone.

603
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,233
I didn't know that you were so far-sighted.

604
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:35,435
Up to now, you might have been suffering,

605
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:37,938
because of my lack of ambition.

606
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,642
Let's do it according to
your wishes, my Queen.

607
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:49,850
Tomorrow at the side hall, together
with the officials, I will discuss the
matter of getting a concubine.

608
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:52,953
Your Majesty.

609
00:49:54,955 --> 00:49:56,356
My Queen.

610
00:49:57,757 --> 00:49:59,459
Yes, Your Majesty.

611
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:10,871
I hate it the most when you're
hypocritical like this.

612
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:17,177
I also hate it when you use
such deceitful words to gain sympathy.

613
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,284
If you are done saying what you
have to, then go back and rest.

614
00:50:25,385 --> 00:50:27,087
It's already late.

615
00:50:47,107 --> 00:50:50,210
How long do you intend to keep
a dead woman in your heart?

616
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:56,416
This place is where a living person should exist.

617
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:59,419
How can it be occupied by the dead?

618
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,025
In Your Majesty's eyes,
don't tell me you can't see my heart?

619
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:13,033
How long? For how long can I stop
treating a dead person as my rival in love?

620
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:21,641
Your Majesty, how long before
you can turn around and see me?

621
00:51:22,242 --> 00:51:23,443
Your Majesty...

622
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:25,745
Your Majesty.

623
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:30,550
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

624
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:33,253
Is anyone out there?
Come in right now!

625
00:51:33,954 --> 00:51:34,654
Your Majesty.

626
00:51:37,357 --> 00:51:39,359
Go and notify the physicians. Hurry!

627
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,461
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

628
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:43,263
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

629
00:51:53,673 --> 00:51:56,776
Fortunately, nothing happened.

630
00:51:56,776 --> 00:52:00,480
How did such a thing happen when both
of them were in Palace Hall together?

631
00:52:01,982 --> 00:52:04,084
I am sorry.

632
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:08,588
Even the Royal Physician does not know what's wrong.
It's just that His Majesty was too tired.

633
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,392
If it can't be changed by human effort,

634
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:15,695
we can only turn to God.

635
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:18,498
When you speak of God...

636
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:23,103
We have to call Shaman Jang back.

637
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:27,507
Does not the Celestial Hall already have
Shaman Gwon?

638
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:30,010
Isn't she just a temporary Head Shaman?

639
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:34,814
It's because of her lack of abilities that
the King's health has become like this.

640
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:42,022
There is no one that is as powerful as
Shaman Jang in the whole of Joseon.

641
00:52:43,123 --> 00:52:47,627
If it's her, then she will definitely be
able to resolve the scourge of the King.

642
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:53,133
And also disperse the annoyance
between His Majesty and the Queen.

643
00:52:54,134 --> 00:52:56,236
Find her for me.

644
00:52:57,437 --> 00:53:00,540
There is something in her
eyes that makes me worry.

645
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:01,942
Your Majesty.

646
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:10,250
It's obvious that she's
hiding something from me.

647
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,454
Find her and confirm it again.

648
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:18,158
The house is already empty.
Please let it go.

649
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:23,864
You said... you haven't seen her before?

650
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:33,273
<i>They looked alike. If she was alive,
would she look like her?</i>

651
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:23,223
My eyes are so puffy.

652
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:26,326
What should I do now?

653
00:54:26,826 --> 00:54:28,728
What do I do about my eyes?

654
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:31,832
You spend the whole day being angry,

655
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:34,034
it's only natural that they would be puffy.

656
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:36,937
What were you doing while
this happened to my eyes?

657
00:54:36,937 --> 00:54:42,542
I tried to stop you,
but you didn't listen to my advice.

658
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:43,944
You should have stopped me.

659
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:46,546
You should have said it more forcefully.

660
00:54:46,546 --> 00:54:49,349
You should have stopped me every time.

661
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:55,455
I committed a sin that
deserves death, so stop this...

662
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:04,664
It's all over.

663
00:55:05,365 --> 00:55:06,166
What?

664
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:09,269
If my husband were to see me like this,

665
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,372
he would definitely hate me.

666
00:55:12,372 --> 00:55:14,074
He'll be disgusted.

667
00:55:15,175 --> 00:55:16,877
He will leave me!

668
00:55:16,877 --> 00:55:18,678
I will be chased out!

669
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:20,981
I'll end up like a living corpse.

670
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:23,183
Then, I'll fall ill and die.

671
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:28,088
Princess, please stop imagining things.

672
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:32,392
I haven't experienced true love yet.

673
00:55:32,392 --> 00:55:36,196
I won't be able to hold a baby
that resembles my husband.

674
00:55:36,196 --> 00:55:41,301
I'll only be a pitiful concubine
who'll die of loneliness.

675
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:47,007
Please forgive me, husband.

676
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:51,811
Why are you behaving
like this, Princess?

677
00:55:56,016 --> 00:56:00,520
Why do you always forget the
date that has been agreed on?

678
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:05,825
Think about it. A woman to first raise
the consummation of a marriage.

679
00:56:05,825 --> 00:56:08,628
Do you know how embarrassing
it is to mention such matters?

680
00:56:09,229 --> 00:56:11,932
Princess Minhwa only thinks about you.

681
00:56:12,232 --> 00:56:13,834
Don't you pity her at all?

682
00:56:14,234 --> 00:56:19,439
I am sorry. I was reading all
night and had forgotten...

683
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:24,244
How is it that you and your
late father are so alike?

684
00:56:24,644 --> 00:56:27,948
Don't tell me you intentionally
avoided her?

685
00:56:28,048 --> 00:56:29,249
No, I didn't.

686
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:33,553
Then why do you always
make the Princess so desolate?

687
00:56:33,553 --> 00:56:36,756
She is still young.

688
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:41,661
In addition, the 3 years mourning
for her father has just ended.

689
00:56:41,661 --> 00:56:44,865
That's only because the
Princess has a baby face.

690
00:56:44,865 --> 00:56:48,568
She is already at an age to
have a child of her own.

691
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:50,470
But, she is still immature.

692
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,272
She is already a woman.

693
00:56:52,272 --> 00:56:55,275
Do not treat her like a younger sister.

694
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:57,477
You two are already a married couple.

695
00:56:57,477 --> 00:57:00,981
Respect her as your wife.

696
00:57:02,582 --> 00:57:08,788
Min Hwa has done so much for our family.

697
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:13,193
Until the day your father died,

698
00:57:13,193 --> 00:57:17,697
he told us never to forget
Min Hwa's kindness to our family.

699
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:21,801
I will remember your advice.

700
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:23,904
Please don't worry anymore.

701
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:35,315
Shinmu, I haven't seen Seol
since early this morning.

702
00:57:35,315 --> 00:57:38,018
I want to go and look for her.

703
00:57:38,018 --> 00:57:40,720
Don't worry about Seol,
she has somewhere to go.

704
00:57:42,322 --> 00:57:43,723
She will be back soon,

705
00:57:43,723 --> 00:57:47,127
so don't think of going out.
Go back inside.

706
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,531
Jan Sil.

707
00:57:51,531 --> 00:57:52,132
What?

708
00:57:52,132 --> 00:57:54,134
Hurry and take her inside.

709
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:56,036
Shaman Jang.

710
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:05,846
How long are you going
to hang around?

711
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:14,955
Please come to the side room.

712
00:58:15,155 --> 00:58:18,959
Innkeeper, we're borrowing the
side room for a moment.

713
00:58:24,364 --> 00:58:27,868
It fell to me to determine the directions.

714
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:32,572
The Professor of Astronomy divined
the heavenly secrets.

715
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:37,477
And even after the Professor of Life Sciences
had finished fortune telling,

716
00:58:37,477 --> 00:58:41,181
we still had a hard time finding you.

717
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:44,784
Do you know how much effort it took us?

718
00:58:46,486 --> 00:58:50,490
Why did you have to go to such great
lengths to find a commoner like me?

719
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:58,398
We came because of an order from the
Great Queen Dowager for you to
immediately return to the Celestial Hall.

720
00:58:58,398 --> 00:59:02,202
Doesn't the Celestial Hall have
many shamans who can watch over?

721
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:04,804
What rubbish.

722
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:09,109
His Majesty's sickness seems to be
progressively worsening day by day.

723
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:13,013
As a shaman, don't tell me you're
not going to lift a finger to help?

724
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:16,216
My shamanic powers,
I have very little left.

725
00:59:16,216 --> 00:59:19,719
It's you who's avoiding the
calls from God.

726
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:22,622
Recently, the direction of heavenly
secrets has suddenly changed.

727
00:59:22,622 --> 00:59:24,724
The Sirius Star's light has become dim.

728
00:59:24,724 --> 00:59:27,427
The moon glows the the colour of blood.

729
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:29,930
It even turned brown a few days ago.

730
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,532
Your help is urgently needed.

731
00:59:32,532 --> 00:59:38,338
The Great Queen Dowager ordered us
to bring you back no matter what.

732
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:41,641
The situation is urgent.

733
00:59:41,641 --> 00:59:45,846
They actually let astronomy professors like us,
who are forbidden to leave the palace,
to come and look for you personally.

734
00:59:45,846 --> 00:59:49,349
No matter how many times you ask,
my answer will be the same.

735
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:54,454
I'm also tired of facing the Confucian
scholars who are always seeking to
abolish the Celestial Hall.

736
00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:58,158
Right now, I really want to take a good rest.

737
00:59:58,158 --> 01:00:00,460
That girl in the room,

738
01:00:02,162 --> 01:00:09,769
is that your successor, the one that
you registered at the Celestial Hall
under your name several years ago?

739
01:00:19,279 --> 01:00:24,985
I will return immediately to see the
Great Queen Dowager, and ask her
personally  to retract the order.

740
01:00:25,886 --> 01:00:29,089
Please all of you, just leave for today.

741
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:33,293
Did she just eat an ox?

742
01:00:33,293 --> 01:00:35,295
She is as stubborn as one.

743
01:00:35,295 --> 01:00:40,800
I'm really worried about facing the
Great Queen Dowager's anger.

744
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,004
We are already here. We can't just
go back empty handed.

745
01:00:44,004 --> 01:00:45,105
What?

746
01:00:45,105 --> 01:00:46,706
Come here!

747
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:49,009
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

748
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:01,321
If she's not here... then...

749
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:03,623
Where exactly is she?

750
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:21,842
Has my magic now gone?

751
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:29,249
Then, what exactly did
I see the other day?

752
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:38,458
<i>You have seen me before, haven't you?</i>

753
01:01:57,577 --> 01:01:59,880
Who are you all?

754
01:02:02,682 --> 01:02:05,185
Come with us!

755
01:02:33,713 --> 01:02:38,118
<i>
These... exactly whose memories are these?</i>

756
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:46,927
~ <i>Lost in longing that grows
stronger and stronger,</i> ~

757
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:53,433
~ <i>is there no way to turn back time?</i> ~

758
01:02:53,433 --> 01:02:56,736
~ <i> If we can return to the past </i> ~

759
01:02:56,736 --> 01:03:00,040
~ <i> If you hold me in your embrace </i> ~
