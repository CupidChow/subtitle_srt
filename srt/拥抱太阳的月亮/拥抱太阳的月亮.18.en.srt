00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:02,892
Episode 18

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,883
Since we are laying together,

3
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,250
doesn't it feel good?

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,392
Yes.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,278
It does.

6
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:22,017
Eunuch Hyung Sun,

7
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:25,562
Don't you think this is too much?

8
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:27,137
Yes?

9
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:30,074
What do you mean?

10
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:32,081
You don't really think

11
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,564
I would do anything before the ceremony, do you?

12
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:38,829
Is it that you don't trust me?!

13
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,695
I believe in Your Majesty.

14
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:47,439
I just don't think I can trust 
the part of a man's instinct

15
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,517
that has been hidden very deep
within you for a very long time.

16
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:54,147
But,

17
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:57,884
how can I fall asleep in this kind of situation!

18
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:06,015
Then, can you keep a promise?

19
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,492
A promise?
What kind of promise?

20
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:10,433
Never, ever . . .

21
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:14,235
Definitely not . . .
Whatsoever . . .

22
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:18,546
You wouldn't give into your manly desires
 and touch even her finger nail.

23
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,733
You have crossed the line!

24
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:25,959
Master Eunuch,

25
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:31,335
If I think about the eight long years 
that I have not been able to see the King,

26
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:34,736
it wouldn't be enough even if
I see him all day and night.

27
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,755
Please, if only in the darkness,

28
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:41,908
let me take his face in my eyes as my heart desires.

29
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:47,175
I will do as you wish.

30
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:52,151
So, take him in your eyes and 
in your heart as you want..

31
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,125
Hah!  He doesn't obey my words 
whom he has served for over 20 years,

32
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,500
but to you!

33
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:13,445
Hah! For for his darned behavior

34
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:17,143
I won't even touch your finger tip,
 so don't worry.

35
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,395
Is that true?

36
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,027
Of course.

37
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:31,114
A man never goes back on his word.  
Definitely wouldn't!

38
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:42,870
Since I dare touched you,

39
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,686
will you chase me out?

40
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,391
No way...

41
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:56,835
Will you give me a punishment?

42
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,992
Of course not.

43
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:01,639
Your Majesty never even touched

44
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,790
a tip of my finger.

45
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:32,400
That one lady-in-waiting of His Majesty's
 has disappeared.

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,927
I don't know if the King noticed or not about her.

47
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,903
But I heard she was moved to another palace.

48
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:45,353
No matter where I tried to find her, I couldn't.

49
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:51,709
Also, except for the few ladies who have 
served him since he was young,

50
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,674
he has changed the rest of the ladies-in-waiting.

51
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:59,283
All the ladies in waiting?

52
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:00,961
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:03,204
I heard it like that.

54
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,275
He is hiding something

55
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,359
in the main palace . . .

56
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,268
Yes?

57
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,186
The King . . .

58
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,692
What is he hiding in the main palace?

59
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:26,708
Princess, you must not run like that.

60
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,790
I'm sorry, Mother.

61
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,362
I want to hurry this happy news to Mother.

62
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:43,925
I'm happy for the news, but
you must be more careful.

63
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:47,750
Didn't the royal doctors tell you to be careful too?

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,875
Yes, Mother.

65
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:55,124
I will be careful and even more careful
 from now on.

66
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,942
Are you well, Princess?

67
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:12,267
Yes.

68
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:16,450
But, who are you?

69
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,048
I am the palace investigator, Hong Gyu Tae.

70
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:22,475
I see.

71
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,675
Befitting your position, you look brave.

72
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:29,690
You must do all you can do for the King.

73
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,925
Yes.

74
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,987
I will keep that in mind.

75
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,037
So, did you find out all the things I asked you to find out?

76
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:47,175
Yes.

77
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:52,817
As you have asked, I met with the previous eunuch
 who memorized all the documents.

78
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,617
But, there was nothing worth listening to.

79
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay.

80
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,300
It's just that . . .

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,700
What is it?

82
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:08,878
Before the previous King ordered to stop the investigation about the Crown Princess,

83
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:11,942
he visited the Suk Young Jea
(Princess's palace) many times.

84
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,117
Suk Young Jea...

85
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:17,742
When you say Suk Young Jea, 
wasn't that Princess Min Hwa's palace?

86
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:19,550
Yes.

87
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,992
The previous King treasured her greatly.

88
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:26,767
It may not be anything of importance,

89
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,575
but something does bother me.

90
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:33,000
What does?

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,900
After the previous King visited 
Suk Young Jea many times,

92
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,383
he chose the current Queen

93
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:42,550
without another selection process.

94
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,597
That is something...

95
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,633
That's not the only thing.
Just in case you would want to know more,

96
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:54,650
 I asked a lady who worked in Suk Young Jea
 at the time.

97
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,517
At the time, the Queen Dowager also

98
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,242
visited Suk Young Jea pretty often too.

99
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:02,675
Grandmother?

100
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes.

101
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:10,608
Oh, regarding the spell you asked about . . .

102
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,183
You don't have to do that anymore.

103
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
I already found out through 
Seongsucheong's Chief Shaman.

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Oh, well then...

105
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:20,925
No,

106
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,892
report the rest of your findings.

107
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:26,858
It is nothing special.

108
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:30,708
Each spell is different, but . . .

109
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:34,300
sometimes, instead of a  straw effigy of a person, a person can be used to cast a spell.

110
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,983
A person?

111
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,267
You can use a person as a tool to cast a spell...

112
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,692
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,175
Especially using a person with strong hopes and obsessions,

114
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:47,158
the power of the spell can be enormous.

115
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:53,833
What are you trying to hide?

116
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,511
That is, what you are trying...

117
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:59,275
to uncover.

118
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:02,008
It is all for you.

119
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:04,900
To speak more clearly,

120
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,883
It is to protect you and

121
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:11,700
everything you treasure the most.

122
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,533
When the previous King covered up the truth,

123
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:19,425
there must have been a reason.

124
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:25,167
Before the previous King ordered to stop the investigation about the Crown Princess,

125
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,550
he visited Suk Young Jea many times.

126
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,692
When the previous king covered up the truth,

127
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:33,575
there must have been a reason.

128
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:37,708
Your Majesty,

129
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:42,108
the Queen Dowager had also visited 
Suk Young Jea a few times too.

130
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:44,392
Your Majesty.

131
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,383
Enough.

132
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,908
You may leave.

133
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:51,617
Yes.

134
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,800
Why?

135
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,483
Why Princess Min Hwa?

136
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,867
Why?

137
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:11,200
You said pregnant?

138
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,533
Yes, Your Highness. We just visited the royal clinic
 and confirmed the Princess' pregnancy.

139
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,200
I couldn't be any happier.

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,342
Lately the Royal Palace has been filled
with a heavy atmosphere.

141
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:29,050
This is something to celebrate.

142
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,367
I was worried because she only kept to herself in her room.

143
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:37,950
And it turned out that it may be 
because of her pregnancy.

144
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,667
I am proud of you Princess.
I am very proud of you.

145
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,417
But, Mother.

146
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:49,700
Can I go back home first?

147
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,275
Why do you want to?

148
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:55,300
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

149
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,958
It's not that.

150
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,217
I want to tell Husband this happy news,

151
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,700
as fast as I can.

152
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,575
Your mother will be disappointed.

153
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:09,633
It's been awhile since you've come to the Palace.

154
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,633
You should stay a little longer and...

155
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,133
No.

156
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,892
Didn't they say that daughters become strangers.

157
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:19,467
Let the Princess leave

158
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:23,400
and for you Lady Jung, you should stay and talk with me.

159
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,700
Yes, you should, Mother.

160
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,700
Then, I will leave.

161
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,600
No matter how much you are in a hurry,
visit the King.

162
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,617
Yes, I will.

163
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,900
Crown Prince,

164
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,701
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,800
About what?

166
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,527
Your father is powerless and

167
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:04,103
I couldn't protect that child.

168
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,900
You are smart and clever and

169
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,900
someday you'll understand what I'm saying.

170
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:17,021
Please remember what I am saying from now.

171
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,300
Please tell me.

172
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,000
Please forgive the people who I am trying to protect.

173
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,100
Please protect them.

174
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,200
Yes?

175
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,665
Even if you really can't,

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,211
do not forgive me in the first place.

177
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,162
I'm sorry but,

178
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:42,648
but I cannot understand what the King says.

179
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,498
Crown Prince.

180
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,029
The King's position,

181
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,157
is a very lonely place.

182
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200
There can be an enemy in any place of the world.

183
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,100
And anyone can become an enemy.

184
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,800
There are times when you have to fight your enemies even if you don't want to.

185
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:10,559
That enemy,

186
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:15,957
can even be your blood related family.

187
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,000
I ask of you, please,

188
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,200
even your blood related relatives,

189
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:27,890
please forgive them.

190
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:33,361
Who is the person

191
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:36,083
I have to forgive and

192
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,300
protect?

193
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:51,530
Princess Min Hwa?

194
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,000
I hate you, Brother! I hate you!

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Why are you like this?

196
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,100
You joked around!
Especially in front of him.

197
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,261
I hate you! Hate you! Hate you!

198
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:05,473
Everything the Crown Prince told you is wrong.

199
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:09,137
I'm not a whiny baby, I'm a mature woman!

200
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:12,748
I almost finished learning ChunJaMun
(text book for children)

201
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,101
Your Majesty.

202
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,281
Your Majesty.

203
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,200
Did...

204
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,500
you know?

205
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,194
Therefore,

206
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,070
you hid the fact that your memory had returned?

207
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,000
You should stop this instant!

208
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:12,428
Please withdraw the Royal Order 
commanding Heo Yeom as the Princess' husband.

209
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:15,121
Didn't you hear me say to get up right now?

210
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:18,186
Stopping a talent, such as Heo Yeom,
 from entering into politics

211
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:21,059
is the same as killing him.

212
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,688
How can you compare the honor of marrying into the Royal Family 
 to a death sentence?

213
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:28,132
Taking a man's life isn't the only way to kill him.

214
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:30,582
What?

215
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:36,865
Just like you've ordered, 
I will wed the Home Minister's daughter.

216
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
So,

217
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,403
please withdraw the order to make Heo Yeom 
the Princess' husband.

218
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,487
Leave.

219
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:51,523
Until you withdraw the order,

220
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,920
I will not leave.

221
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,357
Do you have to be dragged out of here

222
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:58,790
by the Royal Guards?

223
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,465
Your Majesty!

224
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,600
Follow me!

225
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:23,449
You rascal!
Do you know what you just did out there?

226
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,465
I . . .

227
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,682
am just trying to save Teacher Heo Yeom.

228
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:29,686
Protect?

229
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:33,340
Do you know how many people have been hurt thanks to your behavior?

230
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,041
Because you reveal your heart in front of the council,

231
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,328
not only Heo Yeom, but also his father has become the council's target.

232
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:43,090
Two!

233
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,911
And, for that, you are now doubtful
 as king material,

234
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,351
so, three!

235
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:50,502
As for the eunuchs from the Crown Prince's chamber that will be punished for you . . .

236
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:55,290
And the poor Joseon citizens who will have to live under your rule.

237
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,146
If you put them all together,

238
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:01,390
the number will fill the Joseon's heaven and earth and more.

239
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,215
When you cannot even control your own emotions,

240
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,484
who can you protect?!

241
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:08,090
Then . . .

242
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:11,932
Should I just watch?

243
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:13,957
Not doing anything . . .

244
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,690
Not changing anything . . .

245
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,707
Not protecting anyone . . .

246
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:22,017
And just following previous precedent
like an incompetent person?

247
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:26,443
Are you telling me to live that way?

248
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:28,965
The so-called King

249
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:32,765
is merely that?

250
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,902
The more you try to protect,

251
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,848
the more they will get hurt.

252
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:42,065
The more you try to gain,

253
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:44,273
the more you will lose.

254
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,600
That is politics.

255
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:51,792
And the role you have.

256
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:55,565
If you really want to protect, 
 do not reveal your emtion. 

257
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,965
If you want to gain one,

258
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:01,248
you must throw away one.

259
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:04,240
You must lose in order to gain,

260
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,465
You can take to throw.

261
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,021
That is . . .

262
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,732
politics.

263
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,298
So,

264
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:19,857
what did Your Majesty take?

265
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
What did you gain?

266
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,132
What did you lose?

267
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,082
I lost the loyal subject, 
 I protected him safely.

268
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:35,382
I lost Yang Myung,
 I protected you instead.

269
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,298
I lost your princess,

270
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:43,507
I saved your sister, Min Hwa, instead.

271
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,500
I . . .

272
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,040
will not do that.

273
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,107
If it is right, I would protect it upon my life.

274
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:58,840
if it is wrong, I would throw away all that is gained.

275
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
My Joseon

276
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,600
will be like that.

277
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:32,932
Have you forgotten the decision you  made then?

278
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:36,590
"Right Jeong, Put Chi."

279
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,690
Did you forget that is your politics?

280
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:45,882
Put everything and everyone
in their rightful place.

281
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:50,557
Giving back to the person 
who actually deserves the position 
and taking from the one who does not.

282
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:52,932
That is what you should do.

283
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,800
You must not go off that path!  
Have you forgotten now?

284
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:11,757
Subtitles brought to you by team 'Eclipse'@Viki.com

285
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,500
He didn't tell you where he was going?

286
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,923
I do not know.

287
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:34,607
Orabeoni!

288
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,800
Have you been well?

289
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,500
I heard from the Queen that your health
 has greatly improved.

290
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,700
But why is your face hardened?

291
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,400
Princess Min Hwa...

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Yes, Orabeoni.

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Scholar Heo.

294
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:03,017
Did you covet him that much?

295
00:20:03,017 --> 00:20:05,060
Pardon?

296
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,857
So,

297
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:11,455
that's why you did such a cruel thing?

298
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:14,473
Cruel thing?

299
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,600
What are you talking about?

300
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Teacher Heo Yeom's sister.

301
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
Yes?

302
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:31,563
I. . .

303
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:35,678
I don't know what you're trying to say.

304
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:37,236
Nothing...

305
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,996
Why?

306
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,700
Why did you do it?

307
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,446
Getting yourself involved 
with the Crown Princess' death. . .

308
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,200
WHY?!

309
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,539
Please keep this a secret from Husband.

310
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,500
It's okay if you punish me,

311
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:09,969
but . . .

312
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,430
Just not to my husband...

313
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,149
I beg you.

314
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,717
I beg you.

315
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:19,582
Lift your...

316
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,529
head...

317
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:25,759
I said to lift your head!

318
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,454
You...

319
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:35,372
You...

320
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:38,497
Do you know what disaster you have brought about?

321
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,755
With the same gaze...

322
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:46,563
With the same voice...

323
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,700
With the same words...

324
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:57,896
Father also said them to me.

325
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:02,121
Please save me, Father!

326
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,868
Do you know what disaster you have brought about?

327
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:11,223
I did not know! I really did not know!

328
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:18,893
Grandmother told me just to sit there.

329
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:25,255
And if I did that, I would be able 
to have Scholar Heo.

330
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:33,479
I didn't know Yeon Woo would die!

331
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,800
Listen carefully to what I say, 
as of now.

332
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,700
No one...

333
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,500
must know about this.

334
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:50,511
Until you die,

335
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:52,938
you must keep closed your mouth.

336
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,874
Do you understand what I'm saying?

337
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,800
That's why I did not say anything about it until now.

338
00:23:04,304 --> 00:23:06,396
I really didn't know.

339
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:12,942
I found out the truth after I moved into their home.

340
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:17,563
After I saw my husband crying out for her.

341
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,600
I...

342
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Only then did I know what I had done wrong.

343
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,600
Father sinned more.

344
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:38,670
You committed a sin harsher than death
 to the former Chief Scholar.

345
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,938
To me and Lady Yeon Woo!

346
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:46,618
For that sin,

347
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:49,604
how will you pay retribution?

348
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,663
With what will you repay that sin?!

349
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:57,949
Even if I went back to the past,

350
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:01,271
I . . .

351
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:05,705
would have chosen Husband.

352
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:09,599
Even if I receive thousands of punishments . . .

353
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,174
Even if I am thrown into hell!

354
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:20,229
I don't regret that decision.

355
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,900
I will abandon you.

356
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,896
I will only be able to fix

357
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,000
the sins against my in-laws

358
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,600
by abandoning you.

359
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,604
So, I will...

360
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,688
I will accept the punishment.

361
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,400
However do not punish my husband

362
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,200
and the baby in my belly

363
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:50,454
who is my husband's seed.

364
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,300
Don't abandon them.

365
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:02,608
What...

366
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
did you just say?

367
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,900
I will leave now.

368
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:23,274
Husband must be waiting.

370
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:32,529
Princess.

371
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,745
Husband.

372
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:37,146
Why are you like that?

373
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:43,696
Did you hear bad news from the doctor?

374
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:45,471
Then,

375
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:48,246
how did it go with your doctor?

376
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,481
I . . .

377
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:56,004
have . . .

378
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:59,563
your child inside my belly.

379
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:01,388
Yes?

380
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:13,304
I am sorry. 
I should have noticed it first, but I didn't.

381
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,179
No.

382
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:20,379
I didn't know either.

383
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:22,000
It's just . . .

384
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Just?

385
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,500
What is it?

386
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,100
I have...

387
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,700
something...

388
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,329
to tell you.

389
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,300
Yes.

390
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,000
Please tell me.

391
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:52,554
The truth is . . .

392
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:59,888
The truth is...

393
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,400
Was this something you didn't want?

394
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,900
It's not that.

395
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,900
This is something I wanted very much.

396
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Thank you.

397
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,846
Thank you. Wait, no. The word thank you 
doesn't even describe how I feel.

398
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:38,179
And also, I am sorry for not being able
 to repay this debt to you.

399
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:43,346
But, thanks to you, now I can face my father proudly.

400
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:48,929
You are very admirable. From now on,

401
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:52,013
I will serve and love you more.

402
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:59,554
Please don't cry.
The baby will be surprised.

403
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,800
It will be a son.

404
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,800
He will be smart just like his father.

405
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Since he is very bright and his personality is like a silk,

406
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,800
he will be an important person to this country.

407
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,500
Unnie, what's wrong?

408
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:03,229
Did I say something that upset you?

409
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,600
Didn't I tell you not to go back there?

410
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,954
Why didn't you listen to me?

411
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:14,154
What should I do since Master is so pitiful?

412
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:19,371
He's married to someone who killed his sister...

413
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:21,654
Be quiet!

414
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,800
You shouldn't have told me.

415
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,700
You...

416
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:33,304
told me that if I don't tell you everything, 
 you would run into the palace asking for answers.

417
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
That is why I told you.

418
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,300
You still shouldn't have told me.

419
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,100
My lady and master, what will I do?

420
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,400
What should I do?

421
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:57,894
 Subtitles and timing by 'Eclipse Team' @viki.com

422
00:30:57,894 --> 00:30:59,852
Your Majesty.

423
00:31:02,835 --> 00:31:04,252
Your Majesty.

424
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:07,044
Can I come out?

425
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,700
No

426
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,700
You cannot...

427
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,700
I...

428
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,710
can't face you.

429
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,500
I swore I would catch the person 
who made you like that.

430
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:27,794
And, cruelly kill that person.

431
00:31:28,435 --> 00:31:30,352
However,

432
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,900
the people who did all that to you,

433
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:37,877
were my blood relatives.

434
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:43,127
The person who tried to kill you

435
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,200
and killed you,

436
00:31:46,994 --> 00:31:50,260
and covered up your death,

437
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,300
were all my blood relatives.

438
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,169
What right do I have?

439
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,460
How can I face you?

440
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,500
Didn't you ask why I didn't tell you

441
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,600
that my memory had returned?

442
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,900
This was the thing of which I was afraid.

443
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Your Majesty will be sad

444
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:52,644
and wouldn't see me.

445
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:55,952
The reason you're like this...

446
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,200
is basically because of me.

447
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,169
If you say it that way...

448
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,210
I will start to blame myself for being alive.

449
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,585
I . . .

450
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:16,794
What should I do?

451
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Please...

452
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:22,419
bury it.

453
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,700
Should Orabeoni find out about this,

454
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,700
he wouldn't be able to stand it.

455
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,419
Aren't you bitter...

456
00:33:31,852 --> 00:33:35,569
That you had to hide for so long?

457
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,377
Doesn't the pain you received

458
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,044
bother you?

459
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,160
It was horrible.

460
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,810
That is why I do not

461
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,577
want to share this horrible pain with my brother.

462
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,600
Do you only feel sorry for your brother and . . .

463
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,000
Don't you pity me?

464
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:01,369
If you aren't the Queen,

465
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:04,144
I must embrace another woman.

466
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:09,077
Am I not pitiful to you?

467
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:13,044
How can you not feel bad for me?

468
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:34,852
Did you say the OnYang Palace?

469
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:36,435
Yes.

470
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:38,519
Spring is coming, but

471
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,369
there is still cold air in the morning and at night.

472
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:43,500
That place would be better for you

473
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,300
than in the Palace.

474
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,085
Are you really recommending OnYang Palace
 for my well-being?

475
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:51,935
Or perhaps ...

476
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:53,102
You should

477
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:55,335
retire from politics and

478
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:58,327
rest peacefully.

479
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:00,919
That is impossible, Your Majesty.

480
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,400
No one can take me out of this position.

481
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,752
If not,

482
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
choose.

483
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:12,977
Will you go to OnYang as I said or,

484
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,127
will you come to Court in person and

485
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:18,269
be judged for your crime?

486
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,952
Court?

487
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,535
Judgment?

488
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:27,544
What sin that I, your grandmother, have committed that you speak of?

489
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:29,210
8 years ago.

490
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,000
The sin that you killed the Crown Princess.

491
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,827
Bring the evidence.

492
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:36,385
Also . . .

493
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:39,060
Using your granddaughter as an offering 
for an evil spell,

494
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,977
Bring in the evidence.

495
00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:44,419
Do not confuse my father with me!

496
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Your Majesty.

497
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,500
I . . .

498
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,500
will not let things go unpunished just 
because you are my blood relative.

499
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,800
So why don't you just let everything go here,

500
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,135
and move to OnYang Palace?

501
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:01,927
This is . . .

502
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:06,002
the last thing I can offer you, as your grandson.

503
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:09,769
What do you earn by doing this?

504
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,744
The rightful thing.

505
00:36:11,744 --> 00:36:14,002
That is what I will earn.

506
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Why don't you know that you still need me?

507
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,600
You told me it is harmful to go against the natural law.

508
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,900
So,

509
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,710
follow the natual law is what you told me.

510
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,419
Your natural law

511
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:31,760
is to follow the path as it lays.

512
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,300
My natual law

513
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,710
is to right the wrong forthwith.

514
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,919
Therefore,

515
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,300
for the first time,

516
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,500
I will return everything back to its rightful place.

517
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,994
You cannot do this to me.

518
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:48,627
I . . .

519
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,710
will not see

520
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,752
you depart tomorrow.

521
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:56,094
Please,

522
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,419
stay healthy.

523
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:12,044
King!

524
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:15,835
The throne you are sitting on,

525
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:20,960
Do you really not know who made it possible?

526
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,544
It is I.

527
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:26,035
This Grandmother of yours . . .

528
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,244
For you . . .

529
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:30,877
Just so that you can keep your throne,

530
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:35,900
I have gotten blood on both my hands for you.

531
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,710
But OnYang Palace?

532
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:42,127
To give up my position?!

533
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,935
There is no law like this!

534
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:47,044
You cannot do it!

535
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:50,002
You cannot!

536
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,500
Your Highness!

537
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,210
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

538
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,500
Your Highness!

539
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,100
Bring the royal doctor!
Hurry!

540
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,600
Your Highness.

541
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:10,169
Your Highness.

542
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:14,335
Suddenly, she is to go to OnYang Palace?

543
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:18,335
He says it is just a vacation, but it is the same as kicking her out.

544
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:20,335
That is such a rude thing to do.

545
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:23,277
This is the same as declaring war.

546
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:26,927
That's right.
Despite the fact that King knew the whole truth,

547
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,300
he still decided to strike.

548
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:32,910
There will be chaos here soon.

549
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:36,585
Since the King has unsheathed his sword,

550
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:40,685
none of us will be able to stay alive.

551
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,560
What should we do, Prime Minister?

552
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,460
Then,

553
00:38:46,394 --> 00:38:48,644
we need to strike first.

554
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:50,235
When you say we need to strike first....

555
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:55,327
As the old saying goes "If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."

556
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:57,127
However,

557
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,669
there is no reason

558
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,400
for getting out of the kitchen.

559
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,627
We just need to change "the heat."

560
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,900
Isn't that right?

561
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:24,810
Are you leaving now?

562
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:29,294
My injury has somewhat healed.

563
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,510
And, I am not even a monk.

564
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,352
So what would I do staying here much longer?

565
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:38,977
Will you walk with me for a moment?

566
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Prince Yang Myung...

567
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,000
Yes?

568
00:39:53,544 --> 00:39:55,960
'I won't be shaken.'

569
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,200
'I won't be swayed.'

570
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,002
Prince Yang Myung, 
Do as you wish.

571
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,100
From now on,
do what you want to do.

572
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,502
And do what your heart wants to do.

573
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:17,252
Live like that.

574
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:20,794
Do you mean it?

575
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:24,135
Because I believe in you.

576
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,410
I believe that if it's you,

577
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,085
you'll make the right decision.

578
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,300
Believe.

579
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:37,669
Do you know that word is dangerous?

580
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,544
Prince Yang Myung...

581
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,700
This too will pass.

582
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:48,702
When time passes,
the seasons change,

583
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:50,969
sorrow,

584
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:54,085
will also pass.

585
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,852
And,

586
00:40:55,852 --> 00:41:00,627
a new destiny will come.

587
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,101
No matter what kind of life Prince Yang Myung chooses to live,

588
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:11,344
and what choices you make on that path,

589
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,900
this mother,

590
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,460
will believe in you.

591
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:19,919
No matter what kind of decision I make?

592
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:21,660
Yes.

593
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,619
No matter

594
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:26,294
what kind of decision you make.

595
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:34,047
[Korean Folk Village]

596
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:54,150
Prince Yang Myung!

597
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,313
Why are you here in such cold weather?

598
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Please don't run away.

599
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,200
We're just here to greet you.

600
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,200
A greeting in the middle of the night?

601
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:10,325
First, let's go in.

602
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:20,379
Since His Majesty is not healthy, there is not a single day that passes quietly within the royal court.

603
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:26,510
I am worried that the country will be filled with confusion in the future.

604
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,500
And not to mention the need to produce the heir,
 but the consummation hasn't even taken place.

605
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,700
Isn't that worrisome?

606
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,500
Your concerns are utterly groundless.

607
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,856
His Majesty is still young and 
will soon recover his health.

608
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:44,967
What are you worried about?

609
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:48,429
Of course, he must become healthy.
It's just...

610
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,700
so to speak, be prepared for the worst.

611
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,900
Better safe than sorry.

612
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,882
That is good!
 Don't you think it's unfair?

613
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:06,359
You're as qualified to be a king as His Majesty, 
aren't you, Prince Yang Myung?

614
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,800
Qualify ...

615
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,000
That is more than I deserve and 
and that was an even more dangerous comment.

616
00:43:16,817 --> 00:43:18,390
So,

617
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,216
what are you trying to say?

618
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:26,550
If there is no heir to the throne, 
we will experience  political chaos.

619
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:30,086
Wouldn't it be too late then?

620
00:43:33,158 --> 00:43:35,442
Then,

621
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,800
what should I do?

622
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,700
People raising the issue of the next ruler . . .

623
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,400
Even though His Majesty is still alive . . .

624
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:10,700
Isn't the line of this sword beautiful?

625
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,246
Yes, it is.
But-

626
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:13,950
What a waste!

627
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,800
I get to use this rare sword

628
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,617
on the dirty flies.

629
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:27,617
Whose throat should I slit first?

630
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,100
When I present the heads 
of the traitors to the King,

631
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,050
how much would the reward be?

632
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,675
What traitors? We are not!

633
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:37,800
You're greatly misunderstanding,
 Prince Yang Myung!

634
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,814
As a warning to the disloyal,
 should I cut out your tongue first?

635
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:47,675
You are misunderstanding words
 of loyalty to the country.

636
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:50,095
Let us go now.

637
00:44:51,348 --> 00:44:55,296
If you say another ludicrous word
 out of your mouth,

638
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:01,672
your head and your body

639
00:45:01,672 --> 00:45:04,909
will forever be parted.

640
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,700
Not in a million years . . .

641
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:11,967
He called us into his room for the first time, 
so I thought he had changed his mind. But,

642
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:15,784
I almost lost my neck because of it.

643
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:18,825
True,

644
00:45:18,825 --> 00:45:22,100
if he gives in too quickly, it won't be interesting.

645
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:26,742
So,

646
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,100
is that all?

647
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,800
That is . . .

648
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,600
Who is the person behind this?

649
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,117
Go and tell him,

650
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:43,400
try not to check on me with hired help, but

651
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,092
to come to me himself 
if he has something to say.

652
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:49,631
I understand.
You may leave now.

653
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,100
But,

654
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,100
why is it Prince Yang Myung?

655
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,175
The King has trusted Prince Yang Myung for so long.

656
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:08,325
How can the Minister of War not know the obvious?

657
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:11,817
Then the Minister of Finance knows?

658
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:17,234
For everything in the world, 
 the motive is important.

659
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:24,034
He ran away with the girl. 
But the King snatched her back from him.

660
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:28,317
King or whoever, 
he would like to turn upside down.

661
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,600
Then,

662
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,300
for a mere girl, would he stand against the King?

663
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,742
Wouldn't it be dangerous,

664
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,200
now that he is on the opposite side?

665
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,500
But Prince Yang Myung

666
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,600
cannot betray the King that easily.

667
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:47,659
Betrayals often come from those who are closest to you.

668
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,800
A tiny crack eventually destroys the dam,

669
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,700
And trivial misunderstandings lead to tragedy.

670
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,600
If the King passes away,

671
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,700
To the one who is next in line for the throne, 
 Yang Myung,

672
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,545
won't the throne be transferred to him?

673
00:47:04,545 --> 00:47:05,925
Furthermore,

674
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,100
this is something that will change our nation.

675
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:13,522
How can we further the cause by

676
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:15,600
presenting someone less qualified than the king?

677
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,800
But will Prince Yang Myung accept it so easily?

678
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,400
We'll have to convince him somehow.

679
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,500
Your Majesty,

680
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,800
 Aren't you curious about my last card?

681
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:41,142
Subtitles brought to you by Eclipse Team @ viki.com

682
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,300
Mother,

683
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,400
Why are you visiting the Palace so often?

684
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,800
She is the niece that I told you about.

685
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,200
The Queen seemed depressed so I brought her so that she won't be lonely.

686
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
What's your name?

687
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,350
Kim Soo Young is my name.

688
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,725
Is this your first time coming to the Palace?

689
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:14,517
Yes.

690
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,142
How do you feel coming here?

691
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,200
The chambers layered around are 
 like guards protecting the king and queen.

692
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,800
I realize the meaning of nine layered palace.

693
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,900
So, how good it would feel to live 
 in this beautiful and big palace.

694
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:35,850
That's what I think.

695
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,350
You want to live in the Palace?

696
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,517
Yes.

697
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,175
You are ambitious for a girl.

698
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,278
Then,

699
00:48:50,278 --> 00:48:53,184
do you want a tour of the Palace?

700
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:57,809
Do you want a tour of the Palace?

701
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,800
Yes?

702
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,600
If you want to, I can make it 
so that you can live there.

703
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,300
Your Majesty!

704
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,200
She is still young, but she understands and listens very well. 
She is pretty smart.

705
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:39,950
She will be good encouragement to you.
So please let her stay by your side.

706
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,475
Mother.

707
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:49,707
Father might abandon me.

708
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,000
Abandon you?

709
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:59,017
You shouldn't say such things.

710
00:49:59,017 --> 00:50:00,767
No.

711
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:06,984
Father can do that.

712
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:09,934
If he thinks he doesn't need me,

713
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:12,873
even if I am his daughter,

714
00:50:12,873 --> 00:50:15,784
he can throw me away at anytime.

715
00:50:16,742 --> 00:50:22,617
Then who will take your place?

716
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,500
Lady Jo...

717
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:43,617
Did you call for me?

718
00:50:43,617 --> 00:50:46,700
Take this girl out and give her some tea.

719
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,300
Yes.

720
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,600
Just as you said, even if he adopts her 
and brings her into the palace,

721
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,267
she will still only be a concubine.

722
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,663
And also, the King

723
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:16,125
will not want to be with a girl that young either.

724
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:19,475
If the person sitting on the throne changes,

725
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,500
the situation would become different.

726
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,700
What do you mean by the person sitting on the throne changing?

727
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:34,267
If it is Father,

728
00:51:37,475 --> 00:51:40,500
it is definitely possible.

729
00:51:41,102 --> 00:51:43,903
Master.

730
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,600
What's the matter?

731
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:54,333
A visitor is outside.

732
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:57,752
Didn't I say not to let anyone in?

733
00:51:57,752 --> 00:52:04,918
But . . .  H - He's not a person that can be asked 
to come and go.

734
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,200
Prince Yang Myung,

735
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,978
I came to have a drink with you.

736
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,300
Since the 'rats' that came beforehand 
have already hinted at your purpose,

737
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,591
let's skip the tedious preambles
and proceed to the main issue.

738
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:56,660
Personally,

739
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,671
Don't you want to be the sun? 
(sun means king)

740
00:53:02,365 --> 00:53:05,569
The words you have spoken just now...

741
00:53:05,569 --> 00:53:09,874
Do you truly not understand
what they signify?

742
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,900
How can I say it
without knowing the meaning?

743
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,400
Funny.

744
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:20,855
Why is it me?

745
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:23,541
What about the other 
numerous gentlemen from the royal family?

746
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:28,392
The crucial things are... 
Motives and Aptitude.

747
00:53:28,392 --> 00:53:31,000
The motivation to become the king. And . . .

748
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,704
The aptitude 
 to be accepted as a king.

749
00:53:33,704 --> 00:53:36,241
Oh...

750
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:39,145
There are no such qualifications 
 for a playboy like me.

751
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:41,560
Furthermore, since I have a tendency 
to wander around

752
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,614
And a suffocating throne doesn't suit my taste,

753
00:53:45,614 --> 00:53:48,124
there can be no motive whatsoever.

754
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:53,841
Therefore, don't drag me
 into your absurd conspiracy.

755
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:57,203
All of those are pretenses
to hide that you are the King's brother...

756
00:53:57,203 --> 00:53:59,249
How can I not know?

757
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:03,154
You already knew?

758
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:07,473
Then you would understand my wish
to not be involved in such backlash.

759
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:10,292
If you retreat now,

760
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,900
then I will leave this as a secret
 from the King.

761
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,957
For eternity,

762
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:18,866
do you intend to live under the King's shadow?

763
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:21,334
Even if I have

764
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:25,408
the motives and aptitude
as you mentioned,

765
00:54:25,408 --> 00:54:27,958
there needs to be a justification for a rebellion.

766
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:30,050
Justifcation...

767
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,194
can be easily made.

768
00:54:32,194 --> 00:54:33,991
How?

769
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:38,642
Avoiding the responsibility of producing a successor, 
 he has, thus, troubled the nation...

770
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,208
What an irresponsible king.

771
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:43,418
In the nation based on Confucianism,

772
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:47,499
he lets a shaman girl into his room at night. 
What a dissipated King.

773
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:51,824
And a king who disrespects his elders.

774
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:54,324
If it is this much,

775
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,916
isn't it enough?

776
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,700
But that shaman is not just any shaman.

777
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,700
The Crown Princess who died 8 years ago
 and came back to life ...

778
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,500
is connected to her in that way.

779
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,650
Now personally,

780
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,958
Isn't that being too cheap?

781
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:18,249
You...

782
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,700
already knew?

783
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,478
I knew it before.

784
00:55:24,478 --> 00:55:26,433
I'm pretty smart.

785
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:27,722
Then,

786
00:55:28,486 --> 00:55:30,840
if you knew . . .

787
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,999
Yet, you tried to take the King's woman?

788
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:35,777
While . . .

789
00:55:35,777 --> 00:55:38,666
knowing that doing such a deed is 
an act of treason?

790
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:48,374
You've worked well. Thanks to you, 
I solved a lot of problems.

791
00:55:48,374 --> 00:55:54,185
I know I shouldn't be saying this. 
But I am worried that what I've discovered 
will make you more concerned.

792
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,749
It was something I needed to go through to realize a  few things.

793
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,800
It is only right that I should be rewarding you for all you have done.

794
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,048
But there are more important things 
for you to do at the moment.

795
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:05,374
If you say important things, what...

796
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:16,066
In that secret command

797
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:18,374
are things listed

798
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,849
that you need to do and people to meet.

799
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:22,791
Once you start, do it as ordered.

800
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:25,916
I will heed the command.

801
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,949
Since I have convicted them of a crime,

802
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:40,741
they will soon try to counterattack.

803
00:56:40,741 --> 00:56:44,749
Soon, they will try to spread rumors
 intended to hurt me.

804
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:50,166
My existence has become a burden to you.

805
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,000
Do you really think I would just sit 
and allow them to harm me?

806
00:56:56,004 --> 00:56:57,541
Wait and see.

807
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,600
Throughout the nation,

808
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,166
an interesting story will spread.

809
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,866
For now, will you . . .

810
00:57:09,866 --> 00:57:12,374
walk with me for a moment?

811
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:27,233
Actually,

812
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:29,766
I . . .

813
00:57:29,766 --> 00:57:33,363
hid a present for you here.

814
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:36,333
I already have everything.

815
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:40,991
Why would I want anything else?

816
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,500
It's already prepared,

817
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,666
so try to find it.

818
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:25,616
Aren't you looking too earnestly as someone
 who said she didn't want anything else?

819
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:30,109
What is it?

820
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:33,499
Is it something small that a naked eye cannot see?

821
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:36,416
Small?
It's not small!

822
00:58:56,624 --> 00:59:00,041
It's not possible.

823
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:03,291
Are you giving me this Hidden Moon Building?

824
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,700
You are quite ambitious! 
No, that is not it.

825
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,200
Then, what is it?

826
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,000
What I wanted to give you was

827
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
something you cannot exchange 
with anything else in the world.

828
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,708
Unique, unchallenged . . .

829
00:59:21,654 --> 00:59:24,533
Something that any woman

830
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:26,374
would want.

831
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:30,091
Impossible.

832
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:33,141
You've figured it out.

833
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:37,216
You are right.

834
00:59:37,216 --> 00:59:39,124
It is I.

835
00:59:43,266 --> 00:59:45,331
Why did you just laugh?

836
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,141
Are you saying it's funny?

837
00:59:47,141 --> 00:59:50,432
How can I dare?

838
00:59:52,383 --> 00:59:54,333
I like it.

839
00:59:55,366 --> 00:59:58,258
I really like it, that's why.

840
01:00:07,141 --> 01:00:09,483
You have given me

841
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,500
your heart.

842
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,727
So, I am

843
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:16,991
giving you

844
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,300
my all.

845
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:22,999
Your Majesty...

846
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:26,249
Is it that you have already given up?

847
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:31,149
The King is planning to give the shaman girl the queen's position.

848
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:36,066
And how disparagingly did the late king 
treat you and the king?

849
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,883
How he mistreated you, Prince Yang Myung,

850
01:00:38,883 --> 01:00:40,916
Have you forgotten?

851
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:50,733
Prime Minister,

852
01:00:50,733 --> 01:00:53,849
You picked the wrong person, you really did.

853
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:56,074
Do you think so lowly of me,

854
01:00:56,074 --> 01:01:00,624
as to commit such a crime out of jealousy,

855
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,300
in order to steal the throne?

856
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:10,183
I have no interest in the throne,

857
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:15,996
or to hurt the king or for wealth and fame

858
01:01:15,996 --> 01:01:18,083
and power.

859
01:01:18,714 --> 01:01:21,574
Those things, I do not need.

860
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:24,500
I am disappointed that you do not covet anything.

861
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,800
Alas . . .

862
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,700
If he is a useless card,
then I will just throw him away.

863
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,900
What I want is...

864
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:40,170
The supervisory position of Jongmyo ancestral rites 
(essentially, the King's position or recognized as the first born son) and

865
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,000
Heo Yeon Woo.

866
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,200
Only those two.
