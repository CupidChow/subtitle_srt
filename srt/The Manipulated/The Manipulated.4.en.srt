All right, you're all set.

00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,903
I really appreciate it.

5
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,738
Go get some rest.

Our power just went out.

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,593

I'll check it out.

How much longer should I wait here?

23
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,441
He could have been joking, right?

24
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,736
Well...

25
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,572
whether he comes out or not,
I'm worried sick.

26
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,170
I have to find a way
to sneak in there

27
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,630
and utilize the ventilation ducts.

28
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,383
Huh?

29
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,886
What is this?

30
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,889
Seriously?

31
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,350
Who left this out?

32
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,644
Shit! What the hell's
wrong with these guys?

33
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,357
What's that?

34
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,153

36
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,203
There's something up there?

37
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,429
Dammit, Cheolhwan, I told him to round up
the guys to catch those rats.

38
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,889
They're all over the place.

39
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,481
Oh, shit.

40
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,691
Oh, come on.

41
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,860
Huh?

42
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,503
Mr. Noh?

43
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,619
Good to see you. How you doing?

44
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,995
Oh. Hello, Officer Yang.

45
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,080
Hi.

46
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,417
-I'm just... You know...
-You're here to see someone?

47
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,422
Yeah, I, uh... I missed the window
to schedule a visit.

48
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,506
Oh, really?

49
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,676
Oh, dear.

50
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,939
I'll handle it for you.

51
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,066
-Come on.
-Oh, no, no, don't worry about it.

52
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,569
I'll just...
I'll come back tomorrow and do it.

53
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,237
Oh, just a minute.

54
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,626
Yes, Chief.

55
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,254
Hey, idiot.
Weren't you on duty this morning?

56
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,505
Yes.

57
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,382
The inmates left
the cleaning tools down there.

58
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,842
Rats running around the vents.

59
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,679
Next time, make sure they tidy up
after themselves and turn off the lights.

60
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,183
Ah, you can't trust that asshole
with anything.

61
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,317
It's not easy dealing with these inmates.

62
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,735
Yes, yes, of course.

63
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,696
-Hop in.
-No, it's fine, really.

64
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,907
I'll just come back tomorrow, okay?

65
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,283
-Are you sure?
-Yes, yes.

66
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,203
All right. Well, in that case,
I can give you a lift into town.

67
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,039
No, I drove, so I have my car.

68
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,667
-Ah.
-Well, I'll be going now.

69
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,045
-Have a safe trip back.
-Thank you.

70
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,810
Ah, shit.

Is it your first time visiting?

76
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,802
I have a grandson who's locked up in here.

77
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,346
Gu Jiyong, that brat.
He put us through hell.

78
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,245
Don't forget to take your ID back
when you're ready to leave.

79
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,916
Number 242, please come get your ID card.

80
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,001
Oh, yes.

81
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,299
Oh, no! What am I going to do now?

82
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,259
-We told you before.
-I'm so sorry.

83
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,845
You're not allowed to bring food in here
but you decided to anyways?

84
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,267
All right, keep your lead.
They're on your tail. Nice block.

85
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,768
Watch your side, left side.

86
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,438
-Let me know today's lap time later, okay?
-Yes, sir. I'll do that.

87
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,607
Okay...

88
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,610
Hey, come here.

89
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,114
What if you add
a special item to the race?

90
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,198
Huh?

91
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:07,078
Like, maybe you push a button and then
banana peels fly out onto the track?

92
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,830
Then the drivers will start freaking out.

93
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,207
They'll crash, or maybe
their cars might explode.

94
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,959
Yes, that sounds like fun.

95
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,836
I'm not playing around.

96
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,923
I'm sorry.

97
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,634
-The lap time. We got a new record!
-What is it? Great!

98
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,594
You shaved off a second. You hear that?

99
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,679
A full second!

100
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,931
Let's go! That's what I'm talking about!

101
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,061
Great job! That was amazing!

102
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,605
It's a new record! One less second!

103
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,277
Sir, our new record is 1.3 seconds.

104
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,738
We'll rank at the top this season
for sure.

105
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,366
If we manage our condition and avoid
any major accidents, victory is ours.

106
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,995
Isn't it more fun
when there are some accidents, though?

107
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,498
Uh, if our drivers
were to get hurt on the racetrack,

108
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,083
then we'd be in serious trouble.

109
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,044
I thought you were serious about winning.

110
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,171
We are. We're here to win.

111
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,132
The whole team has been working hard
and giving their best, just for you, sir.

112
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,552
I doubt you're giving it your all
if you're this worried about accidents.

113
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,222
If you want to be victorious,
you have to be willing to risk everything.

114
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,812
But, sir, if there is an accident
out there

115
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,232
and one of our drivers gets killed,
how would we recover from that?

116
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,488
Ah! The problem is clear now.

117
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,783
It's not a problem, sir.

118
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,368
You don't think their lives
are worth sacrificing.

119
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,204
We're done here.

120
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,793
As of today,
we are no longer your main sponsor.

121
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,002
What?

122
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,385
You seem to be enjoying yourself, Master.

123
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,889
Seems I've been focusing
on all the wrong things.

124
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,809
Now I've finally found the real deal.

125
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,519
I'm glad to hear that.

126
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,020
May I ask what it is?

127
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,613
Sounds like fun, right?

128
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,199
That's exactly what I would expect
from you.

129
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,953
Which means I need a list of clients
connected to the Ministry of Justice.

130
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,501
I'll get the list
and bring in a foreign security agency.

131
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,922
Nanny, you're the only one
who understands my vision.

132
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,364
Hey, open the door. Now!

133
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,831
What about the study?

134
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,166
Did they seize everything?

135
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,584
Yes, sir.

136
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,169
Oh, son of a bitch!

137
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,298
Just hole up somewhere.
Keep this to yourself.

138
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,925
-Understood.
-I'm hanging up.

139
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,010
Warden, it's the--

140
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,970
-Ah, just tell me later.
-No, he's already later.

141
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,972
No, I think we'll talk right now.

142
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,267
-Commissioner.
-You look like you're falling apart.

143
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,437
-Is this job too much for you?
-To what do I owe this surprise visit?

144
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,647
All of you...

145
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,856
get out!

146
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,399
-You, have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

147
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
Hey.

148
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,697
Hey. What are you doing?

149
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,493
Wow. Did you get these awards
just for housing all those prisoners?

150
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,121
-Yes, that's right.
-That's admirable.

151
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,165
I thought they were just
a drain on our taxes.

152
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,751
-Who...
-Oh, this is--

153
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,795
Why don't you go and drink some coffee?

154
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,838
Uh, yes. I'll come back later.

155
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,760
Listen to me. Whatever this gentleman
orders you to do, don't argue with it.

156
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,970
Just do it.

157
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,513
-What?
-I'll go now.

KOREA CORRECTIONAL SERVICE
GUAN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

159
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,143
I heard you have the most
violent criminals in the country here.

160
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,062
Yes, but who are you?

161
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,570
Who do you think I am?

162
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,365
I beg your pardon, sir,

163
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,119
but may I ask what your relationship is
with the commissioner?

164
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,954
Oh, none at all.

165
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't really know him.

166
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,707
What do you mean by that?

167
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,417
I don't know the Commissioner General,

168
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,586
but I'm friends with the person
who got him appointed.

169
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,254
I have many friends, you know.

170
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,589
Ah, I see.

171
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,967
So, what brings you here?

172
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,263
Well, is this awkward for you, having to
show respect to someone younger like me?

173
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,223
Remember what the commissioner told you.

174
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,018
To take care of you
during your visit.

175
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,103
That wasn't it.

176
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,734
The commissioner told me
I should agree to anything you ask.

177
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,152
That's not what he said.

178
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,491
He said to do
whatever you ordered me to do.

179
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,418
Take a look at this.

180
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,551
PROPOSAL FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES

181
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,845
Doesn't it sound like a fun idea?

182
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,222
-Sure. However this is--
-Oh, I almost forgot.

183
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,892
-How should I say this?
-Here.

184
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,188
I didn't have time to wrap them.
I was in a hurry today.

185
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,232
And I don't like to waste time.

186
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,943
Each is worth 200 million,
if I had to guess,

187
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,863
I'll give you five more
if all this goes well.

188
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,871
It seems like you've been working
really hard trying to get rich.

189
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,457
But you use public funds
to invest in crypto

190
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,251
and bought coins from a bunch
of scammers by mistake.

191
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,378
Right?

192
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,714
And you left all the money you pocketed
in your study.

193
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,091
So it was easy to take from you.

194
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,385
Who told you about that?

195
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:41,055
Didn't I already mention?
I have a lot of friends around.

196
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,724
As for the stuff they confiscated,

197
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,601
would you like them returned to you?

198
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,311
I can make it happen.

199
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,899
Or maybe, you care about
these inmates after all.

200
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,818
No, I don't get attached to the inmates.

201
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,152
Well, that's good to hear.

202
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,821
Then you've got nothing to lose.

203
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,202
This is an opportunity.

204
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,663
You can either agree to it
and become a very rich man,

205
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,457
or maybe you'll lose everything
and they'll fire you.

206
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,419
If you're out, tell me now.

207
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,629
I'll find someone
to take your place easily.

208
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,214
Oh, no, I can do it, sir.

209
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,343
Tell me what you want done.

210
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,265
Now we're talking.

211
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,227
You can authorize your inmates
for work outside the prison, right?

212
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,311
Yes, that's right.

213
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,815
Inmates should be selected
according to the conditions

214
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,608
listed on the last page of that file.

215
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,490
Violent offenders,
murderers, robbers, etcetera.

216
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,033
And if you're short on people,

217
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,369
anyone who pisses you off
will be just fine.

218
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,537
We'll take them.

219
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,956
The game gets interesting
when there's variety.

220
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,040
You got that?

221
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,543
Understand?

222
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,337
Yes, sir. I'll take care of everything.

223
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,673
I'll leave it to you

224
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,885
Have a safe trip.

225
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,643
And grabs a change of clothes...

226
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,188
at 3:30.

227
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,113
B.

228
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,574
Zone B, huh?

229
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,126
MECHANICAL ROOM

230
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,894
CIVIL AFFAIRS SERVICE

231
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,705
MAIN GATE

232
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,383
Right out through the main gate.

233
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,984
Oh, you're awake.

234
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,031
It's a good thing
that Father found you in time.

235
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,199
If he found you any later, you'd be dead.

236
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,042
Who made you eat it?

237
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,419
Or did you eat it on purpose?

238
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,171
What do you mean?

239
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,465
We found huge amounts of warfarin
in your blood.

240
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,926
You swallowed rat poison.

241
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,636
You know that supplement you took?

242
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,347
All that Vitamin K3 acted as an antidote.

243
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,098
It bought you some extra time.

244
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,517
You should thank whoever got that for you.

245
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,853
They ended up saving your life.

246
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,078
Park Taejoong.

247
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,583
You all right?

248
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,591
I heard a lot of stories...

249
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,137
that you went out the main gate
dressed in plain clothes.

250
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,139
Some are saying it was an escape attempt.

251
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,518
Others say you collapsed
after eating food mixed with rat poison.

252
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,353
Who knows what's true?

253
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,608
I do know that something isn't adding up.

254
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,866
I don't think
you'd poison yourself like that.

255
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,744
Someone else did this.

256
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,914
They must have really wanted
to put you out of commission.

257
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,835
I should have kept
a closer watch on things.

258
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,170
I won't let this happen again,

259
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,922
I promise.

260
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,010
And another thing.

261
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,596
If those rumors are true,

262
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,184
that you changed clothes,
used the blind spots to reach the gate...

263
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:24,523
and even managed to get outside,
escaping does seem possible after all.

264
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,985
Nobody ever thinks of
just walking out the front door,

265
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,113
so I'm sure that's the weakest point here.

266
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,454
I treated you too humanely, 2802.

267
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,749
You think you're too humane?

268
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,962
Is that your idea of a joke?

269
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,757
Wow.

270
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,677
I'm really hurt to hear you say that.

271
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,139
You'd be surprised to hear
what people really think.

272
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,187
As soon as you recover,
the investigation will start.

273
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,939
Ah.

274
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,901
Noh Yongsik requested a visit.

275
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,027
Maybe some other time.

276
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,071
Please give him this message.

277
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,158
Thank you for saving my life again.

278
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,120
Is that some kind of secret code?

279
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,081
It's just a word of thanks.

280
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,208
Anyway...

281
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,962
out of everyone here,
you probably say thank you the most.

282
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,840
I guess that means...

283
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,635
you must have been a good man outside.

284
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,102
You're telling me
Taejoong really said that?

285
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,604
Yes, that was it. Word for word.

286
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,942
He said,
"Thank you for saving my life again."

287
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,529
If that's some kind of secret code,
then I don't get it.

288
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,324
You don't know what it means either, huh?

289
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,867
Maybe it's not a code at all.

290
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,754
It was a jailbreak.

291
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,173
Jailbreak.

292
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,597
That asshole.

293
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,600
So that's why he said he was busy.

294
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,728
Yeah, I heard that the priest
brought him in from outside,

295
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,021
but the guards are keeping it quiet

296
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,898
because they're scared
of getting reprimanded.

297
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,108
He was passed out.

298
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,985
Apparently he ate rat poison.

299
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,236
Is that for real?

300
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,738
That's what they said
over at the infirmary.

301
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,990
So I bet it's true.

302
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,617
That asshole tried to escape
while he was dying?

303
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,913
Tell me, why the hell
would he poison himself?

304
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,833
I mean, that shit'll kill you, right?

305
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,960
My old dog ate it and dropped dead.

306
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,220
This shithead is awfully clever, isn't he?

307
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,849
Right now, I'm sure he's up to something.

308
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,941
A few of our guys decided
to switch to Do Gangjae's side,

309
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,320
and I'll bet you it's because
of that shit-head Park Taejoong.

310
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,869
Quiet in there. No chatting.

311
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,625
Look at you.

312
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,503
If you aren't here to let me out, just go.

313
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,089
I'm in no mood for small talk right now.

314
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,801
I've heard what the other inmates
are saying.

315
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,180
The way you keep messing with inmate 2802,

316
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,435
makes you look like a scared dog
that's been backed into a corner.

317
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,361
PROPOSAL

318
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,821
I'm gonna let you out now.

319
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,573
Just don't cause any trouble.

320
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,658
Got it?

321
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,035
You understand me?

322
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,623
Let him out.

323
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,016
The way you keep messing
with inmate 2802,

324
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,897
makes you look like a scared dog
that's been backed into a corner.

325
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,569
Welcome back, boss.

326
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,334
Where's Park Taejoong?

327
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,669
The infirmary.

328
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,981
-Why, what's going on?
-What's happening?

329
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,263
Doctor.

330
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,474
Is everything okay? I was looking for you.

331
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,018
I don't know anything about it.

332
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,355
What?

333
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,734
Hey, what are you talking about?

334
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,820
I'm not responsible for this.
So don't come at me later.

335
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,113
What?

336
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,012
Do it.

337
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,365
Get the lights.

338
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,702
You fucker!

339
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,209
Boss, what do you want me to do?

340
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,966
You guys, break it up now.

341
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,970
You're already in plain clothes.

342
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,263
Why don't you just go home?

343
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,475
You want me to charge
all of you with obstruction?

344
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,020
Yeah, Go for it.
I'll be out of here soon anyway.

345
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,147
You little...

346
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,660
You seem out of breath.
Must be all that rat poison.

347
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,038
It's a shame you're this tired already.

348
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,583
However, I think you'd have to drop dead

349
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,044
for me to get a good night's sleep again.

350
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,130
Do I make myself clear?

351
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,008
I want you to send the inmates out
for community service.

352
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,385
We'll just have to take care
of the paperwork.

353
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,062
This is yours, if you're in.

354
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,564
There'll be plenty more
when the job's done.

355
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:47,150
Oh, shit.

356
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,736
What are you waiting for? It's ours.

357
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,572
-Holy shit.
-Look at all this.

358
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,745
What's wrong? Didn't you go home?

359
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,164
CRPT Support Team,
I need dispatch right now.

360
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,708
I repeat, dispatch right now.

361
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,170
Hey, what's with the siren?

362
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,215
CRPT?

363
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,680
What now? What have they done this time?

364
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,866
Move it!

365
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,300
Disperse.

366
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,968
Disperse!

367
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,638
GUAN PENITENTIARY ANNEX CLINIC

368
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,434
Open it now!

369
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,655
You were born in
the Year of the Rooster, right?

370
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,618
But roosters aren't known
for having long lives, are they?

371
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,708
I mean, just look at you, pouring blood
all over the floor like that.

372
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,796
Why don't you take a nice,
long drag of this cigarette?

373
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,006
Come on.

374
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,592
You don't smoke?

375
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,221
Where's my lighter?

376
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,305
Here.

377
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,686
There's my lighter.

378
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,648
It's so hot.

379
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,234
Feel that? Doesn't it hurt?

380
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,113
Oh, guess it burnt out. No, no, no.

381
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,607
Come on! Hey, get over here!

382
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,942
Come on!

383
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,989
Push!

384
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,750
Let's stop all this, huh?

385
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,711
It's exhausting.

386
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,380
Then put...

387
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,300
that knife down my throat.

388
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,890
Forward, hurry.

389
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,352
Do it. Come on, cut my throat.

390
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,646
Do it. Do it.

391
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,703
Hey, move! Get out of the way!

392
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,002
What the fuck?

393
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,609
Taejoong.

394
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,683
Taejin.

395
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,519
Listen...

396
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,608
I'm so sorry that I couldn't protect you.

397
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,070
Are you doing all right?

398
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,906
Me?

399
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,912
I'm okay.

400
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,248
And what will you do now?

401
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,252
I gotta get out of here...

402
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:23,922
somehow.

403
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,257
It's dangerous.

404
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,968
You have to be careful.

405
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,971
I'll find them...

406
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,559
and...

407
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,898
I'll make them all pay
for what they did to you.

408
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,568
I promise you, Taejin.

409
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:59,123
Hey, this isn't right!
I told you I'll change the whole setup.

410
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,669
Shit.

411
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,015
Go straight ahead.

412
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,558
Don't let them get away.

413
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,726
All right?

414
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,563
Hey, what the fuck? What the hell is this?

415
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,232
You lucky prick!

416
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,360
Get him inside...

417
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,570
quickly.

418
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,197
Where are we going?

419
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,075
Come on, hurry! There's no time.

420
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,181
Close it.

421
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,398
Let me see. We've got 12 inmates.

422
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,824
Aggravated assault, threats,
severe injury.

423
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,159
That's a lot of convictions.

424
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,910
What a piece of work.

425
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,974
YEO DEOKSU

426
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,394
This mod boss still has
over seven years on his sentence.

427
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,313
RAPE WITHIN FAMILY RELATIONS

428
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,273
He even raped his own sister?

429
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,743
GU JIYONG

430
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,416
DO GANGJAE

431
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,839
PARK TAEJOONG

432
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,941
The Manipulated

433
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,656
playing over speakers]

434
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,161
Did everyone sleep well?

435
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,037
Thank you for coming.

436
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,125
You must be wondering where you are
and why you're here.

437
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,877
Well, your time begins now.

438
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,338
This is the land of opportunity.
