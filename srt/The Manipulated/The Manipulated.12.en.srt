1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,957
The Manipulated

2
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,124
What is this place?

3
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,002
Actually, it used to belong to my mom.

4
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,504
Come in.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,485
Why don't we do this at my shop?

6
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,905
I doubt they'd come looking for us
in a place they already caught us.

7
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,703
Unfortunately, they have bugs
and cameras all over your place.

8
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,290
Wait, you found all these
planted at the store?

9
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,335
I searched everywhere I could,
but there might still be more.

10
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,588
So I think it's better
if we stay here for now.

11
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,465
Sure. I think that's a good idea.

12
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,342
All right.

13
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,135
I'll get some things from the car.

14
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,596
Wait. I have the keys. I'll go with you.

15
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,850
Looks like everything is proceeding
according to plan, Young Master.

16
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:04,935
That's right.

17
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,437
Now that Park Taejoong
has been taken care of,

18
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,605
we can finally relax.

19
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,567
But I have a feeling
that after tomorrow's auction,

20
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,278
things are going to get quite busy
for the artist Arleli.

21
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,488
Is that so?

22
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,077
Yes.

23
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,205
Inmate 2802
hanged himself this morning.

24
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,958
He's dead?

25
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,963
Park Taejoong committed suicide?

26
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,714
Seriously?

27
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,842
Yes. I checked the body myself.

28
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,848
Well, it sounds like you're in
a pretty tough situation, huh, Warden?

29
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,892
-Am I right?
-You're right.

30
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,645
So since he killed himself...

31
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,606
Okay, I get it.

32
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,322
Did you hear that?
I did what you told me to do.

33
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,621
Hey, I have a couple of gold bars.
You want one?

34
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,043
He should at least answer
when someone talks to him.

35
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,338
From now on,
everything you say is being recorded.

36
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,136
We'd better get ready
to welcome our guest.

37
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,388
We're having a guest?

38
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,557
Make sure to sweep and polish everything.

39
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,059
Shall we throw a party?

40
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,535
Baek Dokyung was right.

41
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,622
The murders all took place
within ten days of the auction.

42
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,292
And the police were able to catch
all of the culprits within a week.

43
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,378
That's exactly like
what happened in Taejoong's case.

44
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,882
So then these sculptures were...

45
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,551
That's right.

46
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,929
They were payment
to cover up the murder cases.

47
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,140
That miserable jerk.

48
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,602
And this one here...

49
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,355
is mine.

50
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,690
Those assholes are sick.

51
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,026
That's insane.

52
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,486
How could a person do that?

53
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,154
Shit.

54
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,074
The auction is tomorrow.

55
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,785
Park Taejoong.

56
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,412
You need to make that bastard pay.

57
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,249
Yes, that's right.
You gotta hit him hard this time.

58
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,543
Show no mercy. Just crush him, Taejoong.

59
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,589
ARLELI'S "WAILING SERIES" SETS RECORD

60
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,803
I'm gonna step out for a little while.

61
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,556
Yeah, okay.
Hey, just be careful.

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,660
Hello. We're from the Office
of the Inspector General.

63
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,579
Oh. You're here early.

64
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
You're Officer Yang Cheolhwan?

65
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,748
Yes. Now let's see.

66
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,294
I tried to organize the evidence materials
in my own way.

67
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,796
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

68
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,591
We received reports of bribes
from inmates. Come with us.

69
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,925
What are you talking about?

70
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,343
-Wait a minute!
-Hey!

71
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,846
You should've just
taken me up on my offer.

72
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,181
What? Hang on! Let me go! You...

73
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,516
What the hell did you do?

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,352
-Let go, damn it!
-Close the door behind you.

75
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,356
AUCTION AND EXHIBITION
FOR ARLELI'S 100TH SCULPTURE

76
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,569
TAKES PLACE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 6TH
AT MIRAE ART GALLERY

77
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,790
ARLELI'S "NO. 100" EXPECTED
TO BREAK AUCTION RECORD

78
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,794
The Manipulated

79
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,134
How are you feeling?

80
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,053
Hard to say.

81
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,764
I'll know for sure once this is over.

82
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,809
All you need to focus on right now
is enjoying yourself.

83
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,435
Yeah, of course.

84
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,534
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will now begin our auction

85
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,037
for the 100th piece
by renowned artist Arleli.

86
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,082
Now, given the special significance
of this 100th work,

87
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,835
we will open bidding at 6.1 billion won

88
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,379
with further increments
of 300 million won.

89
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,507
I'm going to outbid everyone
and buy that sculpture.

90
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,050
You have a lot of confidence.

91
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,969
...at 6.1 billion won.

92
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,595
6.1 billion.

93
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,097
We have 6.1 billion.

94
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,390
6.4 billion.

95
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,393
We have 6.4 billion won
from a guest in the private room.

96
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,228
Do I hear 6.7?

97
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,688
We have 6.7 billion.

98
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,440
6.7 billion accepted.

99
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,858
Do I hear seven billion?

100
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,067
We have seven billion.

101
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,862
The guest in the center of the room
bid seven billion.

102
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,656
We're now going to raise
the bid increment to 500 million.

103
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,783
Do I hear 7.5 billion?

104
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,951
7.5 billion.

105
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,078
We have 7.5 billion won.

106
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,288
7.5 billion.

107
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,457
We're now at eight billion.
Eight billion won.

108
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,083
Do we have eight billion?

109
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,501
Eight billion?

110
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,796
Yes. We have a bid for eight billion
from someone in the private room.

111
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,090
Eight billion is now the highest bid.

112
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,219
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now increase
the bidding increment to one billion won.

113
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,679
Do I hear nine billion?

114
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,184
A guest at the back of the room
has just made a bid for nine billion won.

115
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,727
Nine billion is the highest bid.

116
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,854
That means we're now
asking for ten billion.

117
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,938
Ten billion won.

118
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,441
We're checking both online
and in this room.

119
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,236
We're asking for ten billion from
the guest in the private room right now.

120
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,030
Nine billion won is the highest bid.

121
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,907
Going once, going twice...

122
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,451
We now have ten billion.

123
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,412
The guest in the private room
has made a bid for ten billion.

124
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,040
That's ten billion
for the artist Arleli's 100th work.

125
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,419
It seems that someone else
is also after this piece.

126
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,088
I think you're right.

127
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,174
But my friend here can't buy it
when he has no money.

128
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,550
Your friend, huh?

129
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,262
Ten billion going once, going twice...

130
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,473
Sold!

131
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,725
The artist Arleli's 100th work

132
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,686
goes to the guest in the private room
for ten billion won.

133
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,979
Congratulations.

134
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,774
Now I'm sure that many of you
are extremely curious

135
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,901
about the identity of the artist.

136
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,195
And today Arleli will finally be revealed.

137
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,782
We will now hold a special ceremony,
and Arleli will personally present

138
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,867
their 100th work to the winning bidder.

139
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,830
Arleli, please come to the stage
and reveal yourself.

140
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,794
Arleli, are we here?

141
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,504
Please come to the stage.

142
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,419
Long time no see, friend.

143
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,594
Oh, fuck me.

144
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,512
Don't kill me.

145
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,183
-You want to live?
-Yes please. I really do.

146
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,560
There's something I need you to do for me.

147
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,898
You thought I'd just drop dead, huh?
You motherfucker.

148
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,784
Are you An Yohan?

149
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,329
An Yohan, you're under arrest for murder,

150
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,123
aiding and abetting murders,
and destruction of evidence.

151
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,375
-What the hell?
-Back off!

152
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,420
You have the right to an attorney
and to have your defense heard.

153
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,593
That's right,
you son of a bitch.

154
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,094
Now you're totally fucked.

155
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,598
You killed my father too,
didn't you, asshole?

156
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,439
I'll take care of all this, don't worry.

157
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,941
For now, just call our friend.

158
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,651
Yes, Young Master, I will.

159
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,924
Put him in the car. Come on.

160
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,268
Inmate 1055.

161
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,942
AUCTION AND WINNING BID

162
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,371
Taejoong. That bastard got arrested
at the auction.

163
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,082
He'll probably be out soon.

164
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,667
Huh?

165
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,670
All the guys that hired
that piece of shit, they're at the top.

166
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,880
I'm sure they're well connected
to the police.

167
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,675
-You mean the ones buying the sculptures?
-Yeah.

168
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,012
Then we're never gonna be able
to take this guy down.

169
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,224
If we want to catch him, then we have to
secure all of the evidence that he has.

170
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,892
And today is our only chance.

171
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,227
-I gotta head out.
-Okay.

172
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,438
Just be careful.

173
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,244
It's all in here.

174
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,288
Check it out.

175
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,249
You are aware that if you do this,

176
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,293
you'll no longer have
any legal protection.

177
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,296
I know. I don't give a shit
about that anymore.

178
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,090
I want that son of a bitch
to pay for what he did.

179
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,967
Shit! This fucking hurts.

180
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,093
Am I done yet?

181
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,306
I need a rest. Doctor's orders.

182
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,358
Ah, son of a bitch!

183
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,055
When you show up, call this number
and the staff will guide you.

184
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,102
Okay, I'll head over right now.

185
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,731
I'll finish everything up here.

186
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,566
Go protect the Young Master.

187
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,193
Understood.

188
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,644
Sorry about this.

189
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,104
Sorry. Our car's broken down.

190
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,438
We'll try to get it moving.

191
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,149
Are you kidding me?

192
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,234
You can't just stop your car in the road.

193
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,611
We're probably gonna
have to call a tow truck.

194
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,363
We appreciate your patience.

195
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,532
-Thank you.
-We'll get it checked out later.

196
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,701
Should've gotten it checked beforehand.

197
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,755
You all right on your own?

198
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,424
Just hurry back to your dad.

199
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,508
Why?

200
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,595
I know that asshole
is gonna track you down next.

201
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,056
So go quickly
and stay by his side tonight.

202
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,601
Call me if anything happens to you, okay?

203
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,603
All right.

204
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,313
Just be careful.

205
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,510
Hey, man.

206
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,554
Do you think you could lend me some money?

207
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,806
I'm hungry, but the food here is terrible.

208
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,017
I want to order something good.

209
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,268
Come on. What do you say?

210
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,106
I'm afraid I don't have the time.

211
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,151
Whatever.

212
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,609
Tell your men I work for you.

213
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,153
Tell them we're on the same side!

214
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,206
Man, this police station
is a real shithole.

215
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,215
No, no, please!

216
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,432
Is this gonna work?

217
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,350
Oh, don't you worry.

218
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,185
This wasn't about you.

219
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,521
The guys who broke in here
and started shit

220
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,025
were just here to get their buddies
out of jail.

221
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,986
You, my friend, were merely a bystander.

222
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:41,120
And when you saw them storming in,
you got scared and ran, simple as that.

223
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,831
That's a good idea.

224
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,626
Now, what do you want?

225
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,796
The warden told me that if I scratched
your back, you'd scratch mine.

226
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,050
Park Taejoong.

227
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,260
I want to know where he is.

228
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,265
I'll make it work for you.

229
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,742
All right, let's get to work.
Finish it off and take pictures.

230
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,120
All right.

231
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,706
How do you want it done?

232
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,750
The way you always do it.

233
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,076
Careful with that.

234
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,994
Take that to the end of the hall.

235
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,174
Yeah, a little to the left.

236
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,553
A little more... Okay.

237
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,727
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

238
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,449
Huh?

239
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,617
She got here pretty fast.

240
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,661
Eunbi.

241
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,174
You were hiding here?

242
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,622
Hey, Dad?

243
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,541
Are you here?

244
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,127
Hey!

245
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,588
-Papa?
-Smile.

246
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,593
Stop it!

247
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,888
Don't worry.

248
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,515
I'll get your picture too.

249
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,078
Ah, poor guy.

250
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,330
You weren't much of a son, were you?

251
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,459
When you meet your father,
show some respect, would you?

252
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,178
You fucking crazy bitch!

253
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,872
Eunbi, just go.

254
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,999
Eunbi.

255
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,169
Run, now!

256
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,472
Aw.

257
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,933
What a terrible daughter!

258
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,227
She runs off and leaves
her own father behind.

259
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,817
Eunbi.

260
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,338
I'm coming, I'm coming!

261
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,422
Dad!

262
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,302
Papa, are you okay?

263
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,095
Hang on, stay with me!

264
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,514
I called 911. They're on their way.

265
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,017
Papa.

266
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,479
Papa!

267
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,897
Let's wrap it up.

268
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,970
This has been a lot of fun.

269
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,097
I admit, I find you fascinating.

270
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,683
How about we finally end this?

271
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,184
I'll invite you to my house.

272
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,771
That's not necessary.

273
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,942
You're there already?

274
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,736
You're in quite a rush, huh?

275
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,996
Hey, you still having fun?

276
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,833
Come on, say something.

277
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,004
Wait. I'll be right there.

278
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,110
You're finished.

279
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,156
Get out of the fucking way, asshole.

280
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,368
Move it!

281
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,759
Oh, shit!

282
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,918
Good to see you.

283
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,504
I thought you'd try to sneak in
from the outside,

284
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,840
but instead you came out from the inside.

285
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,344
Park Taejoong.

286
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:42,976
From this day forward,
I have decided to believe in God.

287
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,189
You see, I prayed for the day

288
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,526
that I'd be able to see you again.

289
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,278
And here you are.

290
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,829
Hallelujah.

291
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,996
So what do you think?

292
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,791
Did I bring enough men?

293
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,211
Park Taejoong...

294
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,130
Let's end this today.

295
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,132
Kill him now!

296
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,782
Shit.

297
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,374
You know, you could have been pretty rich
if you just took the check.

298
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,254
It's too bad the owner's dead now.

299
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,968
What are you doing
snooping around in my house?

300
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,058
You want a drink?

301
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,936
Oh, that's right.
You're more of a vitamin guy.

302
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,982
By tomorrow morning,
the world will know everything.

303
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,194
And they'll see
just what a monster you are.

304
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,200
So you went into my room
and you stole the evidence, huh?

305
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,121
Wow. I didn't realize
you were such a cunning person.

306
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,915
You always seemed so impulsive to me.

307
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,804
It's right here.

308
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,932
Everything you're after, it's all in here.

309
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:56,146
Now, the hard drive you took
will wipe itself clean if you open it.

310
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,398
I knew you'd be coming,
so I set everything up.

311
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,858
A guest will come. Let him in.

312
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,530
-He showed up, sir.
-You know I hate talking to myself.

313
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,282
Why is it you never answer me?

314
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,992
Are you rude or just stupid?

315
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,038
I guess we're done talking.

316
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,174
Drop the knife.

317
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,933
You're out of options.

318
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,601
You're finished.

319
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,354
Wait.

320
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,272
I have a better idea, actually.

321
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,484
Finish him off.

322
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,987
As long as he's alive,
he'll never stop hunting you.

323
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,948
You know that.

324
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,658
So why not just kill him now?

325
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,451
If you do that, I'll let her live.

326
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,799
You evil fucking bastard.

327
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,564
Just let her go.

328
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,607
She wasn't involved.

329
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,612
Yeah.

330
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,823
You're incapable of being a bad guy.

331
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,659
Always caring for others.

332
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,036
Can't even let a sick plant die.

333
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,514
Look at this.

334
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,474
This is my 100th work.

335
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,310
Does it remind you of anyone?

336
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,983
That's right, Taejoong.

337
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,987
After I kill you,
this girl's gonna take the blame.

338
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,772
Aren't you here to kill me?

339
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,899
What are you waiting for?

340
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,658
Look around you.

341
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,994
This is the place
where I ruined your life.

342
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,048
It's also where I killed your brother.

343
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,467
You stupid bastard.

344
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,511
Do it. Come on!

345
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,596
Just kill me!

346
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,983
You...

347
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,319
You ruined my life.

348
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,780
And you killed Taejin.

349
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,033
You should die.

350
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,038
However...

351
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,417
if I kill you, will that change anything?

352
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,755
Cut the crap and finish it.

353
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,760
No, you don't deserve that.

354
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,436
Wait! No, kill me!

355
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,398
I said kill me, you asshole!

356
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,401
Don't walk away from me!

357
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,653
Kill me!

358
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,115
Do it!

359
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,659
Kill me!

360
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,245
Hurry up and kill me!

361
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,831
Stay alive no matter what...

362
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,501
and pay for everything you did.

363
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,794
Kill me!

364
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,885
AN YOHAN FOUND DEAD
AT SCENE OF FIRE

365
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,929
It has been revealed
that the famous sculptor An Yohan,

366
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,807
who died in a fire last week,
was receiving huge sums of money

367
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:51,227
to fabricate real life murder cases
involving high-ranking public figures.

368
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,313
Payments were made
for the buying and selling

369
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,690
of his own sculptures
at exclusive art auctions.

370
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,276
In exchange, he'd conceal
the identity of the murderer

371
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,570
and frame someone innocent in their place.

372
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,114
This was brought to light
by an anonymous whistleblower

373
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,116
and the confession
of a corrections officer

374
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,785
who were connected to the scheme.

375
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,162
Reporters are questioning
if the whistleblower...

376
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,663
Yeah, Dad?

377
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,290
Did you call me?

378
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,876
...and whether they could have
issues down the line.

379
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,419
What?

380
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,340
Taejoong.

381
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,428
I'll call him.

382
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,055
Hold on a sec.

383
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,099
Retrials will begin
for all of the framed victims

384
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,353
and are currently serving time
in connection with the An case.

385
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,564
Relief measures such as
release and pardon will be arranged...

386
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,733
The court finds that not only is there

387
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,486
insufficient evidence
to prove these charges,

388
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,572
but it is also clear that the defendant,
Park Taejoong,

389
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:48,451
was completely unrelated to this crime
and is himself a victim

390
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,870
of a serious human rights violation.

391
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:55,124
Accordingly, pursuant to Article 325
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

392
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,585
the court hereby renders
the following verdict:

393
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,464
The defendant, Park Taejoong...

394
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:03,925
is not guilty.

395
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,748
LATE SHIN JIYOUNG
LATE PARK TAEJIN

396
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,874
6 MONTHS LATER

397
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,717
Is that heavy? Just be careful.

398
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,636
Okay, okay. I know. I saw it.

399
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,763
All right.

400
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,226
These guys are so much easier to raise
than you might think.

401
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,478
They don't need a lot.

402
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,314
You just pull this guy out like this...

403
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,816
and you put it in here...

404
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,652
like this.

405
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,531
What's wrong?

406
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:52,909
Nothing.

407
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,577
Keep doing what you were doing.

408
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,997
It's nice
to see you like this.

409
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,711
Oh. You said no water.

410
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,880
Hey, Taejoong!

411
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,342
Look who's here.

412
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,764
Oh.

413
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,392
Hey.

414
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,477
What are you doing all the way out here?

415
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,562
I said I'd meet you somewhere better.

416
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,815
You opened your shop.

417
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,941
Congratulations.

418
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,734
Here.

419
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,779
This is the one you looked after.

420
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,030
It's grown quite a bit.

421
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,492
Thank you, Officer Yang.

422
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,370
It's Yang Cheolhwan.

423
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,455
You can say my name.

424
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,967
Here you are. Excuse me.

425
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,593
-Oh, thank you.
-Please enjoy.

426
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,054
Hello. Come right this way.

427
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,723
-Over here. Yes?
-Excuse me.

428
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,933
-Can I get another slice of cake?
-Same one?

429
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,476
-That would be great.
-Will do.

430
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,535
Thanks. Have a good night.

431
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,037
-Come again.
-Of course.

432
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,665
Let's wrap things up and call it a day.

433
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,000
Here.

434
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,461
-Hey, I'll take care of that.
-We have to clean this.

435
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,171
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

436
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,424
-Are there a lot of dishes?
-Don't worry, I got it.

437
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,469
All right. The sooner we finish,
the sooner we can eat.

438
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,554
The Manipulated
