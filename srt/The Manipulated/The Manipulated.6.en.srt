1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,260
Which car did you get?

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,845
I think I got screwed.

3
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,849
I should've kept it fair and given
everyone the same car to race in.

4
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,017
Ah, those fuckers.

5
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,312
You got a good one. Sneaky bastard.

6
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,732
No, I didn't. Fucking idiot.

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,366
Everyone's busy making secret alliances.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,451
I think it's smart.

9
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,205
Anyone who goes up this thing alone
is doomed to fail, don't you think?

10
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,375
Hey, did you ask for a consultation?

11
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,752
I think I will.

12
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,089
When I win this, I wanna cut a deal
and see if they'll throw in the car.

13
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,173
You know what I mean?

14
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,638
Hey.

15
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,267
Are you sure this is safe?

16
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,563
They're watching us.

17
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,193
My mission is to spy on you,
so they expect us to talk.

18
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,237
Hey, listen up.

19
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,948
We should team up together.

20
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,870
If the winner gets five billion,
that's a lot of money

21
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,371
and all I want is an apartment.

22
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,166
You can have the rest of the money,
if we win.

23
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,293
Let's be partners.

24
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,919
I'm not interested.

25
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,423
Give your grandmother the rest of it.

26
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,258
You know my grandma?

27
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,804
This must be destiny.

28
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,476
It's a good thing you have
that auto mechanic license.

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,394
No, I don't.

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,562
I saw it.

31
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,029
Listen up.

32
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,240
No matter who wins, we split it.

33
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,161
I want us working as a team on this.

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,914
Which means you do what I tell you.

35
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,082
Got it?

36
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,125
-Yeah.
-Yes.

37
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,961
Stick with me and we can win everything.

38
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,806
Come and sit down.

39
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,945
Thank you for giving up
some of your valuable time.

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,907
Do Gangjae, you're the first
to request a meeting.

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,991
What's this about?

42
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,420
MID-TO-LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP

43
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,629
What's this?

44
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,256
Just keep me in mind.

45
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,508
There are many ways
that I could be of service.

46
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,180
I don't think you'd want me
as a mid-to-long-term partner.

47
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:44,933
Yeah, I would.

48
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,394
You're being
far too humble, sir.

49
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,566
I noticed you've got cameras all over.

50
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,693
The scale of this operation is no joke.

51
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,987
And you managed to bring us all here.

52
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,532
You've even got the warden
afraid to make a move.

53
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,576
Is that so?

54
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,204
Yeah. It's obvious to me that
you're the one who's running the show.

55
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,498
I see the effort
you're putting into this race,

56
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,251
which means that it must be
a long-term investment.

57
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,170
We should become partners.

58
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,880
I am the best person for you.

59
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,633
It would be really good for you
and great for me.

60
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,220
I'm surprised you don't want money
or an early release.

61
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,266
No, I'm not that short-sighted.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,438
I'm not here for the money.
I'm here to network.

63
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,356
Even if I got out, what are the chances

64
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,734
that I'd meet someone
this powerful on the outside?

65
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,028
I don't think I have that kind of power.

66
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,782
You're so coy. It makes you even scarier.

67
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,912
You've got the kind of money
that allowed you to buy this huge factory

68
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,539
and turn it into your personal playground.

69
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,875
I've never met anyone as powerful as you.

70
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,632
Now, if I may be so bold, sir,

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,843
let me open up my heart
to you for a moment.

72
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,263
You know what, it says here
you have 18 fraud convictions.

73
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,224
So you're in the business of flattery.

74
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,768
Just a minute.

75
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,853
Are you kissing my ass too?

76
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,237
No, I was just kidding. Just kidding.

77
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,950
Get to know me and you'll find
I can be a very useful toy.

78
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,494
Please feel free to play with me.

79
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,419
I got it.

80
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,796
I'll think about it for now.

81
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,676
Oh, by the way,

82
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,556
if you require any kind of little
party favors, just let me know.

83
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,851
I can have grade-A goods delivered
within 30 minutes

84
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,060
and at any time of day.

85
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,941
We'll talk later.

86
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,917
We're both busy men,
so I'll keep this short and to the point.

87
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,794
Please do so.

88
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,716
You know all that money
you said you'd give to the winner?

89
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,804
Well, I would like something else instead.

90
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,932
What else would you like?

91
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,062
Ah, what I really want...

92
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:42,527
is to kill one of these sons of bitches
with my own hands.

93
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,701
What's so funny?

94
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,913
Do you like boxing, by any chance?

95
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,542
If you were to kill someone
outside the ring, it's murder. But...

96
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,630
when you're inside the ring,
it's just a part of the sport.

97
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,714
You understand?

98
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,885
So as long as you're playing the game,
do whatever you want.

99
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,055
Don't give up on the prize money, either.

100
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,350
The warden would never approve of this.

101
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,604
He's too much of a coward,
and he kept telling me not to do it.

102
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,233
Ahh.

103
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,778
You, on the other hand,

104
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,322
are much more fun.

105
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,124
I really want this race
to be a lot of fun.

106
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,222
Damn.

107
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,515
Just look at this thing.

108
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,892
Yeah.

109
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,648
Don't go around telling other people
this is my car.

110
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,274
Well, actually...

111
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,323
-This car is trash.
-What?

112
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,202
Hey.

113
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,579
You jealous?

114
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,833
Let's take a look at the brake pads.

115
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,751
Wait. Are you serious?

116
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,336
What the fuck?

117
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,090
Shit.

118
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,551
-Give me the keys.
-No way.

119
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,017
-Here.
-Okay, okay!

120
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,103
I'll give it you.

121
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,648
Here it is.

122
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,942
What, are you angry?

123
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,737
No, I'm not. I'm not.

124
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,904
We're cool.

125
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,241
-Take off the trunk.
-Okay.

126
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,784
-Put on the rear wing.
-Got it.

127
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,081
What's this?

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,668
-Can they do that?
-Shit.

129
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,503
That asshole's just stealing it.

130
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,633
Wait a minute.

131
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:17,307
When they said there would be no rules,
this is what they were talking about.

132
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,476
Search from the top there.

133
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,519
-I'm on it.
-Come on.

134
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,522
What the fuck is this?

135
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,860
An SUV.

136
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,071
Huh?

137
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,155
What?

138
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,365
What the fuck are you doing here, asshole?

139
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,416
Boss!

140
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,711
Number 10 is a sports car.

141
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,129
-A sports car?
-Yes.

142
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,265
Go see what it is.

143
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,485
What the fuck's going on?

144
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,829
-Got a good one.
-Please don't take it.

145
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,247
Hey, get off me, asshole!

146
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,958
Those fuckers.
I knew they'd pull this shit.

147
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,962
Oh, fuck!

148
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,633
What's wrong?

149
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,635
Those bastards are coming to take my car!

150
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,056
Hurry up!

151
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,936
I can't hold it much longer! Hurry!

152
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,771
Goddamn, open the fucking door.

153
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,025
No, you're not coming in!

154
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,404
You're not taking my car,
you fucking assholes! Get off!

155
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,488
Fuck you!

156
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,656
Hurry!

157
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,824
Get in the car!

158
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,910
Run!

159
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,836
Holy shit, this guy's crazy!

160
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,715
Fuck.

161
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,905
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

162
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,366
Hey, get in!

163
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,721
Hey! Move the car, you fucking bastard!

164
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,474
It just won't start.

165
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,559
I guess there's something wrong with it.

166
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,605
Fucking bastard!

167
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,317
If you won't move it...

168
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,155
Fuck you!

169
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,868
Who do they think they are,
those bastards?

170
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,496
The cars have pulled out.

171
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh, shit.

172
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,626
Bitch.

173
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,797
I talked with my friends in Busan
and I told them about you.

174
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,174
And now they want to meet you.

175
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,345
You shouldn't be talking about me.

176
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,055
Why not? It's good for business.

177
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,392
Sons of bitches.

178
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,685
He's not taking this car.

179
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,103
Not today.

180
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,818
Shit! It's Yeo Deoksu!

181
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,070
He's right on our tail. You have to hurry!

182
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,699
Wait, it started already?

183
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,164
Once we're in the car,
the game has started, right?

184
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,421
They're so fucking fast, those bastards.

185
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,798
Shit! This piece of junk.

186
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,383
Yes, I just saw it.

187
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,551
Leave him alone.

188
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,069
He's after my car, too.

189
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,031
We're supposed to be on the same side.
That son of a bitch!

190
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,090
This whole car's gonna fall apart.

191
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,556
This feels so fucking real.

192
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,393
-Hey! Look out!
-We're not stopping.

193
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,281
Whoa!

194
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,325
Holy fuck! What if
they all get killed? Huh?

195
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,435
Look!

196
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,730
All right. Get ready to die, asshole!

197
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,899
-Hurry!
-Shit.

198
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,659
Fuck!

199
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,297
Yeo Deoksu, you son of a bitch!

200
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,007
Fuck you! He's mine!

201
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,634
Oh, shit!

202
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,890
Son of a bitch.

203
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:50,199
Wow, you've really got
a fun life here, huh?

204
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,076
I hope the main game is even more fun.

205
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,497
I think that's enough.

206
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,251
What? Come on. This is fun. Why?

207
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,086
They can't drive if they get injured.

208
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,088
Fucking killjoy.

209
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,435
Well, well, well. How about that?

210
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,061
Your car's completely fucked.

211
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,563
Oh, yeah? So is your face.

212
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,899
You little shit!

213
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,152
You fucking idiot!

214
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,948
Jesus! What a fucking waste of the car.

215
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,492
Fine. I'm going, I'm going.

216
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,705
Hey, you gotta push harder.

217
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,373
I am!

218
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:40,875
Taejoong...

219
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,669
The car. You can still repair it, right?

220
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,547
How am I supposed to repair this thing?

221
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,342
If you can't,
how will I win the prize money for us?

222
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,844
Hey, push a little harder.
Harder, harder. Harder.

223
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,764
Yeah, push, push, push!

224
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,182
Keep going, keep going.

225
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,688
Yeah!

226
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,447
Whoa!

227
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,959
All right.

228
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,126
Not bad at all.

229
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,920
Nothing you can't fix.

230
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,133
Hey, hey. Run!

231
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,345
Aah!

232
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,606
Dude,

233
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,984
you can still fix that, right?

234
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,529
Son of a bitch.

235
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,539
I'm gonna miss you.

236
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,959
Please take one.

237
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,847
Go. Quickly.

238
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,391
Move it!

239
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,632
I enjoyed your practice game last night.

240
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,093
So...

241
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,470
why did you request this meeting?

242
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,400
I was just curious.

243
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,236
About?

244
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,320
Your plan.

245
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,449
This isn't really about a race, is it?

246
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,828
Why do you say that?

247
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,749
For starters,
we've all been given different cars.

248
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,128
There aren't clear rules,
and you keep provoking fights.

249
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,506
And honestly, a place like this
is not exactly ideal

250
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,675
for holding a competition, is it?

251
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,010
You're quite observant.

252
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,471
It'd be too difficult to do this
with regular people,

253
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,140
so instead you're using prisoners?

254
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,434
You're smart too, I guess.

255
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,313
Tell me why you're doing this.

256
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,321
Because it's fun.

257
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,462
What exactly do you need?

258
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,469
Vitamins.

259
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,970
Vitamins?

260
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,682
I prefer vitamins, but...

261
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,144
all you have here is alcohol.

262
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,315
You heard the guy.

263
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,704
From the looks of it...

264
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,167
your friend over there
needs it more than I do.

265
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,715
Because this

266
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,967
doesn't really suit my taste.

267
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,650
It's wilted. Replace it.

268
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,734
Yes, sir.

269
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,092
Where the hell did that asshole
go after ruining my car?

270
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,543
Number six, what does he do?

271
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,672
That guy's useless. You don't have
to worry about him, trust me.

272
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,508
And number eight?

273
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,468
He was a tow trucker in Jangan-dong.

274
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,138
A tow trucker.

275
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,306
That's surprising.

276
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,399
That asshole's the first one
I'm taking out.

277
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,651
Easy, boss.

278
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,445
Don't worry about Park Taejoong.

279
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,363
This all ends once we come in first.

280
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,285
That guy can drive a total wreck
and still win this race.

281
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,746
What a son of a bitch.

282
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,082
Does it hurt?

283
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,168
Oh, this? No, it's nothing.

284
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,336
And the car?

285
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,672
They swapped my car for a compact.

286
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,050
You think I'm just gonna
sit here and take it?

287
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,511
No fucking way.
So I switched it out with a turbo engine.

288
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,932
You've got some skills,
you son of a bitch.

289
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,477
That's right. All these other assholes
are gonna choke on my exhaust.

290
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,686
Just you wait.

291
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,614
Yeah, what?

292
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,977
Hello?

293
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,072
Mr. Do, I think I'm going to
accept your offer.

294
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,409
You won't regret it, sir.
I promise you that.

295
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,453
I left you a gift
in the back seat of your car.

296
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:00,040
And if the race starts to drag,
use it to keep things interesting.

297
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:04,003
Think of it as an investment
in a long-term partnership.

298
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,632
I'm the one person you can count on
to keep things fun for you.

299
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,136
I'm your loyal servant from now on.

300
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,650
Well, that was a load of horseshit.
Fucking idiot!

301
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,588
I think you should join the race.

302
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,759
Today's the day.

303
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,219
You're here.

304
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,637
And you're here early.

305
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,264
Why did you leave the other day?

306
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,766
We were having a blast.

307
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,310
Nah, fuck that.
The real race starts today.

308
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,811
We already played a round.

309
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,522
Shit. I'll take what I had before.

310
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,277
Hey. Should've given me a heads-up.

311
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,383
That look in his eyes...
It feels so familiar.

312
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,260
I put in a lot of money.

313
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,638
-You did.
-Surprised?

314
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,765
Yes.

315
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,559
That bitch is really fucking cute.

316
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,907
That car is fucking garbage.

317
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,409
Just like its fucking driver.

318
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,002
You really put in some work
after that crap you pulled last night.

319
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,254
You're still going down today.

320
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,473
We're starting.

321
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,561
Whoo!

322
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,772
Listen up.

323
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,192
As I mentioned before,
this game has no rules.

324
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:18,280
All of the prize money will be awarded
to the person who finishes 20 laps first.

325
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,242
Now it's time to show
what you're really made of.

326
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,911
I'll buy a house with that money.

327
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,287
Am I splitting five billion?

328
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,497
I'll think about it when it's over.

329
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,250
No matter your vehicle,
put your skills to the test.

330
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,793
In the end, the car doesn't win.

331
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,128
You do.

332
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,467
Get out, asshole.

333
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,260
You hear me? I said, get out, fucker!

334
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,514
Hey!

335
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,152
When it starts, open up the way.

336
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,904
Take out Park Taejoong first.

337
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,280
You got it, boss. I'm on it.

338
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,246
Hey, which number did you bet on?

339
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,666
Nine.

340
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,379
What a punchable face.

341
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,593
Let's go number 9?

342
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,513
Whoa, number 6, all right!

343
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,227
Shit! All kinds of crap!

344
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,979
Cool it, you motherfucker!

345
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,860
Car number 11 is veering off course.

346
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,280
Follow number 11.

347
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,614
-Following 11.
-Copy that.

348
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,910
Fuck you, bitch!

349
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,373
He's fast!

350
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,959
Ahhh!

351
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,089
I'm in first! Yeah, I'm in first!

352
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,716
Fucking stupid bastard!

353
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,638
Please, no! Please! Oh, shit!

354
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,182
Oh, no!

355
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,353
Oh!

356
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,943
Holy shit!
This race is already intense as hell.

357
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,320
Fucking great!

358
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,783
Where have I seen him?

359
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,649
Hey, they just finished a full lap, right?

360
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,609
It looks like it.

361
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,032
I prefer vitamins, but...

362
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,700
from the looks of it,

363
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,495
your friend over there
needs them more than I do.

364
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,044
Bingo.

365
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,420
Our culprit.

366
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,883
No way.

367
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,063
Do Gangjae. Get Car number 9.

368
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,358
You don't have to tell me that, I know.

369
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,943
That bastard's mine.

370
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,413
Number 9, drive!

371
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,165
Number 6, let's go!

372
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,334
Yeah. Step on the gas.

373
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,761
Who's that fucker, number 5?

374
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,221
Okay.

375
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,265
What the fuck?

376
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,933
I wonder what will happen next.

377
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,351
They're really going at it.

378
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,728
I love being fucking rich.

379
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,106
They think they're gonna die,
so they're all freaking out right now.

380
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,357
Fucking idiots.

381
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,618
Look at this guy. Number 6
just pulled off to the side.

382
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,952
What a move!

383
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,666
Number 9. He's breaking off first.

384
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,716
Number 4's chasing number 9.

385
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,093
Number 6 is charging in
from the other side.

386
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,220
No!

387
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,471
You can do it, number 9!

388
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,473
Come on! Step on it! Go!

389
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,892
Park Taejoong!

390
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,696
Oh, fuck that!

391
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,158
You made a stupid bet.
What are you gonna do?

392
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,744
That son of a bitch!
I bet so much on this shit, man.

393
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:06,795
What's this?

394
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,713
Hey. Is that a knife?

395
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,257
It's a knife.

396
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,723
No! Please don't kill him.

397
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,267
Please kill him.

398
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,851
Just fucking kill him! Do it!

399
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:22,978
Let 9 live!

400
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,106
Boss, wait.

401
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,775
It's me, Gu Jiyong.

402
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,569
Park Taejoong. Park Tae--

403
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,282
Car 11's
veering off course again.

404
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,750
Don't worry, Grandma.

405
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,253
I'm gonna get rich,
get out and buy you a house.

406
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,589
Number 9, take him out!

407
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,475
-There's no one inside.
-Well, find him then.

408
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,699
Was that a motorbike?

409
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,826
Hey, isn't it cheating?

410
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,124
Park Taejoong.

411
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,309
Where is he? Motherfucker!

412
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,954
What the hell?

413
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,706
Look, there he goes.

414
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,940
Whoa!

415
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,736
What is this?

416
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,906
Holy shit! Number 9 looks so cool!

417
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,247
Oh, those little rats!

418
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,207
Let's go!

419
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,509
Follow the bike.

420
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,892
Taejoong, where'd you go, asshole?

421
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,520
Do Gangae, now's the time
to show me what you've got.

422
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,242
Now it's getting fun.

423
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,660
This is real Hollywood shit.

424
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,219
He's getting away.

425
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,972
Number 9, you crazy motherfucker!
I fucking love you.

426
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,265
Let's go!

427
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,901
He's right there. Can you get him?

428
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,072
He's way ahead of me. Fuck!

429
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,784
You better catch him quickly.

430
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,759
Those motherfuckers.

431
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,594
Where did those assholes run off to?

432
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,930
There's that bastard!

433
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,640
I fucking got you now!

434
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,231
You son of a bitch.

435
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,905
Oh, shit!

436
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,117
-Is that a gun?
-Hold up. You let them have guns?

437
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,787
Hell yeah! Get to see some people
shoot each other!

438
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,247
This is bulletproof, right?

439
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,874
What the fuck?

440
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,341
I hate you, motherfucker.

441
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,726
Aah!

442
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,332
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

443
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,418
-Incredible!
-Yeah!

444
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,963
This shit is so fucking fun.
This is gonna be a huge hit.

445
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,515
Oh, fuck.

446
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,518
Unbelievable.

447
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,644
This shit is so cool.

448
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,188
Fucking hell.

449
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,358
Starting now, I'm changing the rules.

450
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,528
The one who catches the motorbike
will be declared the winner.

451
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,281
And if you're the one to catch him
dead or alive,

452
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,909
I will double your prize money
for coming in first.

453
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,412
10 billion?

454
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,081
Where is he? Where's his bike?

455
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,083
I gotta find the motorbike right now.

456
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,169
Park Taejoong is worth 10 billion?

457
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,422
Motorbike! Motorbike!

458
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,758
Fuck. I'm really risking it all
for you bastards!

459
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,191
Park Taejoong.

460
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,319
Are you okay? Oh, you're hurt, aren't you?

461
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,947
Huh? You okay? You okay? Are you?

462
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,153
Aah!

463
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,579
Whoa! What was that? What are you doing?

464
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,707
What is that for?

465
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,042
Why do you have a gun?

466
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,711
-Whoa! What the fuck?
-What are you doing?

467
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:09,796
Are you fucking crazy?

468
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,881
Take the guests to a safe place.

469
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,553
Where are we going?

470
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,476
Sorry. Sorry. Okay, okay, okay, I'll go.

471
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,624
Move it! You're blocking the view.

472
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,220
What? Are you scared now?

473
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,763
Are you freaking out?

474
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,395
You're running away now?

475
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,771
Too bad.

476
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,690
Try and hide. Go on.

477
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,409
Let's go.

478
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,369
Let's go. Where are you?

479
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,594
It's all right. Come on out!

480
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,653
Where are you going?

481
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,080
Where are you?

482
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,503
Oh, there he is!

483
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,859
After him, now!

484
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,765
So...

485
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,726
why did you request this meeting?

486
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,524
I was just curious.

487
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,734
Did you come up here all for this?
