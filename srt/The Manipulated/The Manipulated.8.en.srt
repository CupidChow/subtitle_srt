1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,998
The Manipulated

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,519
All Purpose
General Electric.

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,482
There a problem?

4
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,111
Of course not.

5
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,242
Detective, I'd like to ask you a favor.

6
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,619
-What?
-It's about Noh Yongsik.

7
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,291
He gets startled anytime
he sees me on the street.

8
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,460
So if we barge in there right now,
it'll piss him off.

9
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,963
Go easy on him, would you?

10
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:36,430
You listen to me.
Are we here to see an old friend?

11
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,224
If you don't want to go in,
then stay here.

12
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,934
I can do this without you.

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,320
No. Well, that's not good.

14
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,447
Coming!

15
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,160
Officer.

16
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,954
-How have you been?
-Coming through. Move!

17
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,249
-Hang on!
-What's that smell?

18
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,834
Can I help you with something?

19
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,050
You know Park Taejoong, right?

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
Uh, yes.

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,553
-I heard you were close.
-Yeah, sure.

22
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,889
Have you had any contact
with him recently?

23
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,310
-I wanted to know how he was doing.
-What else?

24
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,022
-I asked him if he was staying healthy--
-All right.

25
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,151
So, uh, are you all right?

26
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,529
-Yes.
-A lot has changed for you.

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,782
Was it overwhelming at first?

28
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,285
Well, yes, it was really difficult.

29
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,622
I mean, I wasn't used to taking the bus.
I'd never used a cell phone.

30
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,749
I figured it out eventually, though.

31
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,709
Of course you did.

32
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,171
Oh! Why don't I bring us
something to drink?

33
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,756
-I'll be right back.
-No need.

34
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,008
Come here.

35
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,470
-Come here.
-Okay.

36
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,849
You don't look surprised
that I'm bringing him up.

37
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,267
Something you want to tell me?

38
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,816
You're right.
It is a little strange, actually.

39
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,526
Whenever I'm talking,

40
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,446
you better look at me.

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,951
It's just Taejoong is in prison.
What do you need from me?

42
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,035
He escaped.

43
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,622
Have you seen him? Was he here?

44
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,250
Uh, no.

45
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,336
You won't mind if I take a look inside?

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,255
No. I live here, so I'd rather--

47
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,090
-It'll only take a second.
-Hey! Please.

48
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,217
-Come on.
-That's private! No, that's private.

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,844
It'll only take a minute.

50
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,178
Hey, get your hands off me!

51
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,139
Oh.

52
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,934
Shit.

53
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,603
Who are you guys?

54
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,731
Huh? Just barging in here like this?

55
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,316
I just need to look in there.

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,111
Yeah, why is that?
Trying to look at my underwear?

57
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,155
Hey. No, these two are...

58
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,490
This man is a prison officer
and he's with the police.

59
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,075
Gentlemen, this is my daughter.

60
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,660
Shut up. Don't tell them that.

61
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,371
Why are a prison guard and a cop
in my house?

62
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,082
It's work related.
We just have some questions.

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,418
Ah. You two have some questions,

64
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,545
and that gives you the right
to search my house?

65
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,380
If you'll let us look inside,
we can leave.

66
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,132
I know my father went to jail.

67
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,676
-That doesn't mean you can harass him.
-No, we're not--

68
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,970
You're treating him like a criminal.
It's not right.

69
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,430
Did you hit me, you little punk?

70
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,849
You don't get to call me that.
You were trespassing!

71
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,268
Get out now! Hear me? Get out!

72
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,481
Get out! I said get out!
Leave now! Get out of here!

73
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,191
Get out of here, you motherfuckers!

74
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,651
-Just go outside!
-Go! And don't come back.

75
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,112
-Sorry for the trouble. We'll leave.
-Get the fuck out!

76
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,864
-Get out!
-Sorry for the trouble.

77
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,205
-You, too.
-Huh?

78
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,998
Go out and make sure they leave.

79
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,000
All right.

80
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,344
You two are driving me insane.

81
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,180
Shit.

82
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,808
I apologize.

83
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,353
I know this was a surprise,
and we made a mess of it.

84
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,729
-I'll come back later.
-No, don't.

85
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,941
I would prefer it if you didn't come back.

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,486
-Sorry?
-Frankly, I...

87
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,156
...am not comfortable speaking with you.

88
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,784
That goes for the detective, too.

89
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,120
All right.

90
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,207
I won't bother you again.
Goodbye now.

91
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,973
I said...

92
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,393
You could have been
a little more considerate.

93
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,062
You can be considerate
for the both of us.

94
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,146
Sound good?

95
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,982
We got to keep searching.

96
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,109
All right?

97
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,114
All right, let's go.

98
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,129
The Manipulated

99
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,346
Yes. I'm getting off the bus now.

100
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,391
Are you here?

101
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,853
Do I walk over?

102
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,856
It's not an issue.
I can go over to you. Stay there.

103
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,691
Okay. Got it.

104
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,027
See you then.

105
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,252
Oh, hi, there.

106
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,712
Oh, is the phone yours?

107
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,006
It is. Thank you for coming.

108
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,760
My daughter has severe asthma,
so I can't leave her alone for long.

109
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,844
I get it.

110
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,681
-Here you go.
-Ah. Yes, thank you.

111
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,600
Stop by and get your hair done sometime.

112
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,768
I will.

113
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,145
You have a great day.

114
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,484
Ah! What the... Hey!
Go after that guy! Hey!

115
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,655
Oh, God!

116
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,617
Hey! There he is!

117
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,537
Someone stop him!

118
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,416
Where do you think you're going?
Get him!

119
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
Yeah.

120
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,193
Hold on.

121
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,530
Someone stole the phone?

122
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,407
Are you serious?

123
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,077
I'll call the auction house.
Just head back for now.

124
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,566
So, this pianist is the victim.

125
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,237
And they were trying to plant this phone
at the hair salon

126
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,864
to frame her just like you.

127
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,365
-Yeah.
-Wow.

128
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,035
I'd go crazy if I knew I was being framed.

129
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,203
No matter how many times
you say you're innocent,

130
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,663
who would believe you?

131
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,957
I mean, these movement patterns
match exactly.

132
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,919
Oh! What about those guys
hanging around the hair salon?

133
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,880
Looks like they vanished.

134
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,923
Then the chain of connection is broken.

135
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,384
Hmm. No, I wouldn't say that.

136
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,388
I have their expensive phone, after all,
and they're gonna want it back.

137
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,518
Also, the police stopped by earlier.

138
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,482
-What?
-No, it's fine. Don't worry.

139
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,859
They came by to do
some routine questioning,

140
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,528
Eunbi went off on them
and kicked them out.

141
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,280
It was... I wish you had seen--

142
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,615
-Yongsik...
-Huh?

143
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,701
I don't think staying with you
is a good idea.

144
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,454
No, no, no.
Don't you worry about that.

145
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,456
It's much better for you to stay here.

146
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,041
And you know what they say.

147
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,376
The safest place
is under your enemy's nose.

148
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,171
So don't worry,
they won't be coming back here.

149
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,801
I'm sorry I have to keep
asking you for favors.

150
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,637
Hey, don't talk like that.

151
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,014
You're not just some random stranger.

152
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,311
Oh, this. Here.

153
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,572
Hello?

154
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,824
Looks like I have your phone, doesn't it?

155
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,829
If I return it to you,
how much are you willing to pay?

156
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,373
What the hell did you just say?

157
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,917
I could always sell it to someone else.

158
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,044
Wait, what? Okay, hold on.

159
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,088
Just tell me how much you want for it.

160
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,508
It'll cost you a lot.
And I know you have it.

161
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,635
Just get it ready.

162
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,348
Just my fucking luck.

163
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,434
What the hell happened?

164
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,728
That guy on the bike
drove off with the phone.

165
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,938
He took it? Are you fucking serious?

166
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,149
He said if we pay him,
then he'll return it to us.

167
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,777
This asshole is trying
to sell our phone back to us?

168
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,945
What do I do?

169
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,491
It's fine, okay?

170
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,120
You give this guy whatever he wants.
Just get that phone back.

171
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,124
Son of a... Hey, you're gonna go too.

172
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,293
Make sure you kill this motherfucker.

173
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,088
This guy thinks he can take my stuff.

174
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,424
You're gonna eat shit and die, asshole.

175
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,728
I'm at the spot we agreed on.
Where are you?

176
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,855
You have the money?

177
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,106
Yeah, I have it.

178
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,610
A delivery man
will stop in front of you.

179
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,741
Are you here for the delivery?

180
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,826
Is he there?

181
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,203
Now give him the money.

182
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,996
What if you take it and run?

183
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,417
Isn't the phone
something you guys need?

184
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,711
If you don't like it, then forget it.

185
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,089
Didn't you call earlier?

186
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,848
I gave him the money. Where's the phone?

187
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,396
On the mailboxes
in the building behind you.

188
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,044
Shit.

189
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,775
Shit. Why isn't he answering the phone?

190
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,817
You don't have to worry.

191
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,570
The scheduling delay
isn't going to be a problem for us.

192
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,740
We still have a window.

193
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,624
BAEK DOKYOUNG

194
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,460
You're not one to make mistakes, Director.

195
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,012
I hope this doesn't happen again.

196
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,723
No, it will never happen again.

197
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,353
Throw this away for me.

198
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,522
Trust me.
We're gonna get the phone back.

199
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,194
The thief said he wanted money
for the phone, so we made a deal.

200
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,821
It'll be back here any minute.

201
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,907
-What are you saying?
-What?

202
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,996
You decided that
without getting my permission?

203
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,543
-No, I just... What I mean is I...
-I made it very clear to you.

204
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,712
You were not to fail me again.

205
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,563
Blood splattered all over.

206
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,986
I want you to take care
of this today, and I want a photo of it.

207
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,613
Okay, I will.

208
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,347
Shit.

209
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,048
What do you mean?

210
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,550
What do they collect?

211
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,176
Everything.

212
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,221
From everyday household trash
to cigarette butts.

213
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,890
They collect anything
that could be linked to the victim.

214
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,685
That's how we were able to frame you.

215
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,086
playing through headphones]

216
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,654
Yongsik.

217
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,366
Hey, Taejoong,
Something's going on at the salon.

218
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,159
Yeah. Go quickly.

219
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,578
Hey, who the hell are you?

220
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,254
What's going on out there?

221
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,219
-Get him!
-Go, get him!

222
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,141
Excuse me, miss. We're closed for the day.

223
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,522
The cash is right over there.
It's inside the drawer.

224
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,065
You can take all of it. I don't care

225
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,109
Can I get my hair done?

226
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
What?

227
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,169
Don't let him get away!

228
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,024
Shit!

229
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,168
It's become coarse already.

230
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,088
I just arrived in Korea
and I'm already so busy.

231
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,509
I'll go grab some cuticle oil
for your nails.

232
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,682
You sure about that?

233
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,853
Your daughter in there
will be put in danger, too.

234
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,317
I wouldn't
put your daughter at risk.

235
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,145
Who are you?

236
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,665
-You all right?
-Yes.

237
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,443
Taejoong. You all right? Huh?
The police are on their way here.

238
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,527
They're right in there.

239
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,820
-In there?
-In that room.

240
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm here to help. It's okay.

241
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,557
Park Taejoong.

242
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,602
What are you up to?

243
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,314
Are you looking for me?

244
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,275
Are you trying to meet with me?

245
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,112
Nanny, come.

246
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,074
Park Taejoong is on his way to meet me.

247
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,742
You have guests waiting.

248
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,496
Guests? That's unexpected.

249
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,545
Good to see you, my friend.

250
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,632
Wow! What a nice house.

251
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,509
So, this is where you live?

252
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,353
-I don't recall inviting you here.
-You're right. You didn't.

253
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,522
You kept your address a secret.

254
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,984
Why don't you sit down and join us?

255
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,489
You can return to your work now.

256
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,992
Yes, master. As you wish.

257
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,219
I hope you'll excuse me
for showing up at your home uninvited.

258
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,596
It's all right. I get the message.

259
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,016
No matter where I go,
you can always track me down.

260
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,059
Very well played.

261
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,562
Oh! He didn't even bat an eye.

262
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,314
You're a real badass,
you know that? Isn't he?

263
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,525
I'll get straight to the point.

264
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,409
Do you know who this is?

265
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,495
Yes, I do.

266
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,250
This guy blew up
the game field and took off.

267
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,005
So what?

268
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,299
Seriously? So what?

269
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,010
Wow, you really are shameless.

270
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,511
That's my avatar.

271
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,139
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

272
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,099
You said they'd all die on their own.

273
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,269
So why the hell
is mine wandering outside?

274
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,397
Why? Goddamn it!
And how the hell are you gonna fix this?

275
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,490
I don't think this is a problem at all.

276
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,492
What you think is irrelevant.

277
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,994
If I say it's a problem, it's a problem.
Understood?

278
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,247
Not really.

279
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,508
If you take a large sum of money,

280
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,303
then you have to bear
all the responsibility that comes with it.

281
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,224
Now, I was willing to pay
what you were asking for

282
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,559
because you said
you'd handle this discreetly.

283
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,646
But if he's still alive
and walking around out there,

284
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,689
that's not what we agreed to.

285
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,650
Listen to me.

286
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,569
This can be solved quite easily.

287
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,781
I want results by the end of this week.

288
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,991
Otherwise, the next time I visit,

289
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,246
it won't be for a friendly chat
like it was today.

290
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,455
Oh.

291
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,749
That's quite foreboding.

292
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,681
Now, listen...

293
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,601
I'm still your friend.

294
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,354
Hmm?

295
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,570
Because I don't want this to be
a master-servant type relationship.

296
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,822
Hmm?

297
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,284
Well, you know, I never
thought of you as a servant.

298
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,337
Actually, I think I'll find him
and kill him myself

299
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,755
and get a refund from you.

300
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,592
That sounds good.

301
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,679
Since there's no ashtray.

302
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,494
Hey, I want you to stay abroad
until we catch this guy. Got it?

303
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,039
Yeah, of course.

304
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,666
-You say jump, I jump.
-You punk!

305
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,209
Careful how you talk to me.

306
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,426
Goodbye.

307
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,934
Fuck.

308
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,771
Shit!

309
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,110
This is upsetting.

310
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:02,199
I gave them the opportunity of a lifetime,
and this is what they chose to do with it.

311
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,660
They're down to making threats.

312
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,287
How would you like this handled?

313
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,583
Let's just end this thing.

314
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,507
Yes?

315
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,636
You're saying he took
the woman and the kid?

316
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:30,811
Looks like Park Taejoong
is closer than I thought.

317
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,408
Hold on. Instead of shutting it all down,
I'll offer it as a gift.

318
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,909
A gift for who?

319
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,037
Park Taejoong and his friend.

320
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,123
They're on the hunt and they want answers.

321
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,709
We should at least give them a hint.

322
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,011
Hey...

323
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,640
Why is it dark? Where are they?

324
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,571
Is this son of a bitch a stalker?
What the hell?

325
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,826
Wow!

326
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,335
-Huh? Hey, what is this?
-Just a minute.

327
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,798
-Wait. Who are they?
-It's all right. It's all right.

328
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,094
-I'm scared.
-We're okay. We're safe now.

329
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,388
Ah, you're here, Eunbi.

330
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,351
This is really crazy.

331
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,188
What?

332
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,819
-Grandfather!
-Hmm?

333
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,946
Can I play with this one, too?

334
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,783
Sure. You can play with that one.

335
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,286
I'm letting you play with it
because you ate all your food.

336
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,831
There's lots of cool stuff here.
Go have fun.

337
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,501
And be careful, all right?

338
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,181
What is all of this?

339
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,310
Uh, it turns out there are
people watching you,

340
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,938
tracking your movements,
going through your things.

341
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,691
And we found this.

342
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,363
It's a file full of information about you.

343
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,998
Uh... I don't think it's a good idea
for you two to stay here.

344
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,336
Can you stay at a friend's house,
or maybe with a relative?

345
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,216
We have nowhere to go.

346
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,385
We should find somewhere new,

347
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,471
a place with no previous connections.

348
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,473
I think that would be the safest option.

349
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,269
Where are we gonna find that?

350
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,570
Huh? What?

351
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,199
Why are you looking at me?

352
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,624
-Come in, you can lay her down.
-Okay.

353
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,641
The sheets are all freshly washed.

354
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,393
Thank you.

355
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,396
I'm gonna be sleeping in my friend's room.

356
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,772
Tell me if you need anything.

357
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,233
All right, I will. Thanks.

358
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,654
Also, I just want to say

359
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,241
this means a lot.
Thanks for doing this.

360
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,204
Hmm.

361
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,290
Isn't it nice having people here
after so long?

362
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,710
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

363
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,795
-Yes. Good night.
-Sleep well.

364
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,437
So, this is where you live.

365
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,068
You're not having any leaks
or anything, are you?

366
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,868
Uh... I'm gonna go to the store
and get some stuff you might need.

367
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,036
I'll be back.

368
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,882
Hey, what the hell?

369
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,218
Look, that little girl in there
has asthma.

370
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,220
The smell of smoke isn't good for her.

371
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,100
You're gonna follow me.

372
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,480
What are you doing? Let's go.

373
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:32,028
This is ridiculous. She's just a kid
and she keeps bossing me around.

374
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,672
So, who are you, really?

375
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,716
Are you serious?

376
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,634
That's why you dragged me out here?

377
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,178
I'm seriously fucking confused.

378
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,930
None of this makes any sense.

379
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,599
I want to know the truth.

380
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,392
Did you actually kill someone or not?

381
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,896
Think whatever you want.

382
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,358
If you walk away right now
without answering,

383
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,321
I'm gonna kick out that woman and her kid.

384
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,031
Don't do that. Come on.

385
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,408
Then why don't you explain it to me, huh?

386
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,410
Help me understand.

387
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,557
Can you stop moving around?
Go to sleep.

388
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,898
-You know, Seona...
-What is it?

389
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,859
What if you were accused of murder?

390
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,654
Suddenly they lock you up.

391
00:35:56,446 --> 00:36:00,450
And worst of all, they say you have to
spend the rest of your life in prison.

392
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,787
How do you think you would feel?

393
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,498
What's with
the stupid questions, huh?

394
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,417
Seriously, stop being annoying
and go to sleep.

395
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,808
That fucking idiot.

396
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,352
He's really pitiful.

397
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,119
Hello?

398
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,458
Yeah. Yeah. What?

399
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,754
Yes.

400
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,674
Yes. Okay.

401
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:10,311
It's Eunbi. She said to call this number
if anything happens.

402
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,401
How come you get so nervous
whenever your daughter calls you?

403
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,696
If she called twice,
you might have a heart attack.

404
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,658
Actually, that was my first
phone call with her.

405
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,661
I didn't even know her phone number.

406
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,838
Hmm?

407
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,300
Hey, I found out
where my daughter lives today.

408
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,385
I even got her phone number.

409
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,015
I think you're my lucky charm,
Taejoong, eh? Yeah.

410
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,685
What kind of daughter doesn't
give her dad her phone number?

411
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,021
And she won't even tell you
where she lives?

412
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,857
I don't know how you put up with her
when she's so rude to you.

413
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,818
Oh, no, she's really sweet
underneath all that.

414
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,531
I... took something
that was very precious to her.

415
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,659
I've committed many sins.

416
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,829
Too many to ever pay her back.

417
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,045
Oh. Here. Hold the wheel for a moment.

418
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,671
-Right now?
-Yeah.

419
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,382
-I want to save her number.
-You can save her number later.

420
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,468
-Wait. Hold on...
-Keep your eyes on the road.

421
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,011
-All right.
-Just wait till we get home.

422
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,596
-It can wait.
-Just hold on.

423
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,972
-Here.
-Oh, Jesus!

424
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,724
Come on! Eyes up front.

425
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,518
-This is dangerous.
-I saved it. We're good.

426
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,644
Geez!

427
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,609
Oh, dear. It looks like So Hyeon
turned this place into a playroom.

428
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,196
Wow, We were so out of it,
we forgot to turn off the TV.

429
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,949
-Ah, well, let's see...
-No, give it to me.

430
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,242
Oh! Okay.

431
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,953
Why don't we go ahead and eat?
I'll clean all this up later.

432
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,162
No, I can clean this up.

433
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,164
Now an important news update.

434
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,333
Previously, we reported
on the horrific story...

435
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,836
Hey, I'll do that later.
Let's eat while the food's hot.

436
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,255
-Right, okay, I'm coming.
-Huh?

437
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,217
The case has drawn public outrage
due to the gruesome nature of the murder.

438
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,302
The police have suspected
that the perpetrator

439
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,847
was someone
that the victim had known closely,

440
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,515
and yesterday at 4:00 p.m.,

441
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,726
they announced they had already secured
substantial evidence and were narrowing

442
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,062
-their investigative network...
-What is it?

443
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,815
The police were able to
make an arrest.

444
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:22,110
The suspect, who is now in custody,
was revealed to be...

445
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,070
Doesn't the phone belong to that pianist?

446
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,447
...the victim
had frequently visited.

447
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,993
The police believe the suspect committed
suicide immediately after the crime,

448
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,452
and we have reports that they are now

449
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,329
-speeding up their investigation.
-Shit.

450
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:37,834
Hold on. Does this mean there was
another target besides So Hyeonjung?

451
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,003
What on earth is this?

452
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,629
Now, on to our next story...

453
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,012
I told you, didn't I?

454
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,306
Everything falls into place eventually.

455
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,268
For now, I'd recommend you send
your kid away on a trip or something.

456
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,314
I look forward to your support.
Thank you, Minister.

457
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,858
Shit.

458
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,626
I know
there was some trial and error.

459
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,795
Fortunately, everything worked out.

460
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,255
And it was all thanks to you, sir.

461
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,550
Did it seem like trial and error to you?

462
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,970
Was it not?

463
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,057
I told my clients these guys
would all drop dead on their own.

464
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:20,937
They would simply kill themselves
once they got desperate enough.

465
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,231
That's what I was betting on.

466
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,900
-And it seemed foolproof.
-Hmm.

467
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,361
But not with Taejoong.

468
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,323
Don't you think this will end up
becoming an issue?

469
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,283
It's an opportunity to grow.

470
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,911
From now on,
there will be no more exceptions.

471
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,676
Perhaps I should be thanking him
for helping us.

472
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,492
TO PARK TAEJOONG

473
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,928
Son of a bitch!

474
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,607
GIFT HAS ARRIVED

475
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,702
BAEK DOKYOUNG IS THE REAL CULPRIT

476
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:51,087
NOW FIND BAEK DOKYUNG

477
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,508
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT @d_ _kyung

478
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,730
Now it's time to follow the right path,
Park Taejoong.

479
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,571
The Manipulated
