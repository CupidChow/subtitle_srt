1
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,391
Even if it kills me,

2
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,143
I'll drag you down to hell

3
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,812
to make sure no one
has to hear your bullshit again.

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,480
Just you wait.

5
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,816
There's no escaping me.

6
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:53,071
The Manipulated

7
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,840
DO NOT USE ELEVATORS FOR DELIVERIES

8
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,924
Shit.

9
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
Ugh.

10
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,645
Delivery.

11
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,104
-Oh, hi.
-That was fast.

12
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,314
Sorry for the wait.

13
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,107
-That's all right.
-If you want,

14
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,859
I'll take these down for you, sir.

15
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,611
-Oh, sure, if you don't mind.
-Enjoy your food.

16
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,820
Thanks.

17
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,037
Hello.

18
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,917
Yep. Have a good one.

19
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,380
All right.

20
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,677
Taejin, have you eaten yet?

21
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,596
Come on, man. You gotta eat something.

22
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,515
How's the studying?

23
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,392
Am I gonna be impressed this time?

24
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,769
Okay, keep it up.

25
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,068
-Ah! Seriously?
-Sorry.

26
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,778
What the hell is his problem?

27
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,987
Are you okay?

28
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,031
No, I'm probably gonna bruise now.

29
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,661
Oh, hey, I wouldn't go that way right now.

30
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,121
The traffic's been pretty bad.

31
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,330
Thanks for the heads up.

32
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,416
Hey, when did this place
get self-service machines?

33
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,918
Oh, I actually saw them
getting installed yesterday.

34
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,551
Oh, hang on. Is this one--

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,927
Hey!

36
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,646
Are you kidding me?

37
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,673
Let's go!

38
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,390
The fuck does he want?

39
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,827
Are you crazy?

40
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,912
Get out of the way!

41
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,915
Forget something?

42
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,459
You have to pay for your order.

43
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,545
Here.

44
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,216
This asshole.

45
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,885
Just pay for the food.

46
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,220
I can't believe this.

47
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,144
Appreciate the tip.

48
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,942
Hey, man.

49
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,945
I caught up to that douchebag
in the sports car,

50
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,071
and I got him to pay us back.

51
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,906
So, I'll send you the money in a bit.

52
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,783
Sounds good.

53
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,619
Oh, I got to go. Yeah.

54
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,330
Taejin, hey!

55
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,667
Oh, Hyung.

56
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,210
Sorry. I'll catch you later.

57
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,461
Later.

58
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,505
This looks great.

59
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,008
Come on, hurry up and eat
before it gets cold.

60
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,718
Hmm.

61
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,720
Why are you here?

62
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,971
Are you still working right now?

63
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,641
I had some things to take care of.

64
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,560
Hmm.

65
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,978
Well, at least...

66
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,313
I'm easy to take care of.

67
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,397
No complaints, right?

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,608
I have so many, I can't even list them.

69
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,651
We'd be here all night long if I tried.

70
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,737
Whatever.

71
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,656
Oh, right.

72
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,074
So how's the shop turning out?

73
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,535
Dude, let me show you. Look at this.

74
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,247
We're almost ready for a grand opening.

75
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,915
Pretty nice, right?

76
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,792
I guess.

77
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,253
But why does it look
like Mom decorated it?

78
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,589
Is that where you got your taste from?

79
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,550
You really think
good taste is passed down?

80
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,386
Because I watched Mom a lot
when I helped her out.

81
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,514
I picked up a lot of things
while you were outside messing around.

82
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,643
Okay, fine. In that case,

83
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,353
I'll stop messing around
and just head home.

84
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,188
Wait. At least make sure
you finish your food.

85
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,481
I'll eat while watching my shows.

86
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,983
Come on, man.
Stop wasting your time, okay?

87
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,401
-Oh, there you go.
-You're gonna fail.

88
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,028
And will you ever stop nagging?

89
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,822
-I'll limit it to five hours.
-Do you realize how late it is?

90
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,991
In five hours, the sun will be
creeping through the window.

91
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,827
Whatever, dude.

92
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,704
It's not like it affects me if you fail.

93
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,122
It's your life.

94
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,043
I'll get an A. Stop worrying.

95
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,836
-Have some faith in me.
-Have some faith?

96
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,046
You'll be lucky if you pass.

97
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,423
Maybe try opening up a textbook
instead of the internet.

98
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,591
Right. I got it.

99
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,259
Hey, you should get
some reflective lights.

100
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,969
-It's dangerous at night.
-What?

101
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,054
Okay, I will.

102
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,767
Oh, by the way...

103
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,436
I'll be paying respects
to Mom alone tomorrow.

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,021
What? Why can't I come?

105
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,231
Don't even think about it.

106
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,941
Your exam's coming up soon.

107
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,442
Go on. You better study.

108
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,111
See you Saturday.

109
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,321
See you later.

110
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,716
500,000 WON DEPOSITED
PARK TAEJOONG

111
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,975
STUDY WITH ME
GOAL FIVE HOURS

112
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,018
All right. Let's do this.

113
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,322
Here we go.

114
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,243
I'm too old for this shit.

115
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,624
These look good together.

116
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,168
Jeez.

117
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,295
-Wait hold on.
-What?

118
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,088
You know you can't plant
those in the same pot?

119
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,214
-Why not?
-I got it.

120
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,591
-Leave it there.
-Okay.

121
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,468
If you plant these guys so close together,

122
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,511
-it'll be a disaster.
-Oh.

123
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,013
The big ones steal all the nutrients

124
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,223
from the smaller ones,
and then they end up dying.

125
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,892
-Incoming.
-Bring it a little closer.

126
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,268
-Okay, hold it steady.
-Yeah, I will.

127
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,436
-You got it, right?
-I got you.

128
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,562
-Don't let me fall.
-Taejoong!

129
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,938
-Yeah.
-Come on, dude, pay attention.

130
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,774
-Hurry up!
-Is there a pot for this small one?

131
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,442
Yeah, go over to the storage room

132
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,570
-and there should be one in there.
-Sorry, I'm a little late.

133
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,906
-It's all good.
-I brought some food for all of us.

134
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,449
-Nice.
-Hold on.

135
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,785
-Who's hungry?
-I'm down. Let's eat.

136
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,745
-Come down and eat.
-Here goes nothing!

137
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,747
Whoa.

138
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,501
-Oh, it's so pretty.
-Really nice.

139
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,044
It really looks amazing.

140
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,338
Text me your bank info,
I'll pay you for your time today.

141
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,215
You don't owe me anything.
We're friends, dummy.

142
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,092
Hey, man, time is money, you know.

143
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,426
It doesn't matter we're friends.

144
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,595
So what's my pay then?

145
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,679
Hundred?

146
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,223
Only 100,000 won?

147
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,808
That's all I mean to you?

148
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,851
-You take checks?
-Not even worth it at that point.

149
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,019
It's pretty, right?

150
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,439
Great job, Taejoong.

151
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,817
People love aesthetic cafes these days.

152
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,070
How long do you think
you'll be doing deliveries?

153
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,321
I'm not sure.

154
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,116
I have to make sure this place
gets off the ground first.

155
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,575
And I still have that loan.

156
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,954
It must be tough working two jobs.

157
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,750
Do you think I should have waited
till after Taejin graduated?

158
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,378
I feel like I might have
rushed things as usual.

159
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,422
But that's what makes you charming.

160
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,718
Waiting around for results
has never really worked out for me.

161
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,803
Okay, we're out.

162
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,930
Thanks again for helping out.

163
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,141
-Good night.
-Get home safe.

164
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,187
You know what I like about you?

165
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,524
You always jump in headfirst
and figure the rest out later.

166
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,194
What if I said I like you more?

167
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,238
Okay, okay!

168
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,867
-Let's go.
-Okay.

169
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,869
What?

170
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,121
Why?

171
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,622
Where are you going?

172
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,708
I don't want to leave.

173
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,174
Can I sleep here tonight?

174
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,729
PHOTO

175
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,940
The door is closing.

176
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
No, no, wait.

177
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,651
Ugh, shit.

178
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,265
THIS TREE NEEDS TO BE IN PARTIAL SUNLIGHT
TO KEEP ITS LEAVES FROM DRYING OUT

179
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,898
Excuse me, young man.

180
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,233
Could you lend a hand?

181
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,401
-One moment, ma'am.
-Thank you.

182
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,777
I'll be right back to help you.

183
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,780
So, what can I do for you?

184
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,574
Could you take this up there for me?

185
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,783
-Up the hill?
-Yeah.

186
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,869
-If you don't mind.
-Yeah, no problem.

187
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,953
I got it.

188
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,379
TUNA & MAYO

189
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,090
All right.

190
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,490
Hmm?

191
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,791
What?

192
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,965
Hell--

193
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,718
Hello?

194
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,803
Hello?

195
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,387
Oh, thank God, you found my phone.

196
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,764
I lost it earlier.

197
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,099
Where was it?

198
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,850
Oh, well, you know, the...

199
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,270
The convenience store
by the district office?

200
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,396
It was in the bushes.

201
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,441
I'm sorry to ask,
but could you bring it to me?

202
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,446
Actually, I can't right now
because I'm on the clock.

203
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,241
I'll just leave it with the clerk
inside the convenience store.

204
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,910
Can't you just
bring it to me yourself?

205
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,454
I'll pay you 300,000 won for your trouble.

206
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,248
300,000?

207
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,001
My mom injured her leg,
so I can't leave her right now.

208
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,920
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

209
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,758
All right. Send me your address
and I'll be on my way.

210
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,802
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

211
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,639
For 300,000 won,
I'll take a plane if I have to.

212
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,881
What is this place?

213
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,472
Oh, shit.

214
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,315
Yes. Hello, ma'am.

215
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,400
Hey, are you there yet?

216
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:29,572
Yeah, I made it to the address, but...
it just led me to the front of a tunnel.

217
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,656
Are you here?

218
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,617
I told you
my mom isn't feeling well,

219
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,910
so I can't meet with you.

220
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,954
But if you head inside the tunnel,
you'll see an emergency phone box.

221
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,789
I left the payment in there.

222
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,626
Well, I don't mind delivering it
straight to your house.

223
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,252
Can you give me your address?

224
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,838
It's probably safer than leaving it here.

225
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,091
Well, I'm not comfortable
giving my address to a stranger.

226
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,010
Just leave my phone inside the box.

227
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,429
Okay, sure.
Yeah, I see the box in the tunnel.

228
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,805
I'll leave it in there.

229
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,890
Thank you, ma'am.

230
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,063
Weird.

231
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,357
Why inside here?

232
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,655
EMERGENCY PHONE
SOS

233
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,298
Oh.

234
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,844
Okay.

235
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,187
Whoa!

236
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,610
Are you fucking serious?

237
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,238
There's a person here, you dickhead.

238
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,533
You scared the shit out of me.

239
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,062
Hey, Mom.

240
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,567
Taejin couldn't make it,
so it'll just be the two of us today.

241
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,861
I told him to stay home
because he needs to study.

242
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,487
So don't be too upset with him.

243
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,784
The thing is, no matter how much I nag him
to work harder, he keeps failing.

244
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,413
I don't remember the exams
being all that hard.

245
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,290
Anyway...

246
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,209
Okay. Bon appétit.

247
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,463
-You're so predictable.
-Hey.

248
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,757
What are you doing here?

249
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,634
I knew you'd forget
to bring Mom a gift.

250
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,886
What?

251
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,138
Forget it. Let's just eat.

252
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,223
You know you're supposed to be studying.

253
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,311
Come on. How can I
when you're talking behind my back? Huh?

254
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,356
Mom, he was talking about me, wasn't he?

255
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,775
I wasn't saying anything
negative about you.

256
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,026
I'm just worried.

257
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,446
I was telling her how you're losing
more and more brain cells every day.

258
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,697
My brain cells are doing fine.

259
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,616
Thank you. Okay, what do we have here?

260
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,869
-Where's my bowl of rice?
-There isn't one.

261
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,537
I only brought enough for the two of us.

262
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,039
But I haven't eaten all day.

263
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,667
I won't be able
to study if I don't eat, all right?

264
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,877
Fine, be my guest.

265
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,629
Eat up.

266
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,713
What about you?

267
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,799
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

268
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,429
Do you at least want a bite?

269
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,474
Hurry up and eat before I change my mind
and let you starve to death.

270
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,279
Where did all this rain come from?

271
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,163
Time to eat.

272
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,433
Say cheese.

273
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,517
SUJI

274
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,900
GIVING TREATS TO THE LITTLE ONES
THAT LOOK LIKE YOU

275
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,755
Who is it?

276
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,887
What the hell? Wait. Who are you?

277
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,346
Ah!

278
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,682
Ah!

279
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,935
-Hey, hold him.
-What the fuck's going on?

280
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,312
Park Taejoong.

281
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,063
You are under arrest
on suspicion

282
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,648
of rape and murder.

283
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,400
You have the right to remain silent.

284
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,402
Anything you say can and will be used

285
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,821
-against you in a court of law.
-Wait, no! I didn't do anything.

286
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,073
-Wait.
-Take him in. Take him in!

287
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,451
That's him. Coming up.

288
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,165
Why did you dispose
of the body in the Han River?

289
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,669
Why did you do it?

290
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,631
In recent news,
a woman in her 20s was found dismembered

291
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,382
near a tunnel by the Han River.

292
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,636
A prime suspect has been identified
and taken into custody.

293
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,721
Police have detained
a man who was arrested

294
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,641
on charges of aggravated rape and murder.

295
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,101
He is currently under
interrogation by authorities.

296
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,480
The body is expected
to undergo examination...

297
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,357
-Hello.
-Hi. Welcome in!

298
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,983
...results
will likely take...

299
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,151
What are you feeling?

300
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,236
...mutilation of the body.

301
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,612
Here's your chicken salad, miss.

302
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,989
-...dismembered...
-Enjoy your meal.

303
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,533
The police have issued a statement

304
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,536
that the crime was likely premeditated
rather than a random act of violence.

305
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,787
You must be busy.

306
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,249
The arrested suspect
in question, Park Taejoong.

307
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,587
What, can't look at her?

308
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,549
Detective, I swear on my life.

309
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,467
I've never seen her before, okay?

310
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,802
I have no idea who she is.

311
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,470
Why kill a woman you don't know?

312
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,222
I never said that I...

313
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,516
What reason would I
possibly have to kill anyone?

314
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,769
This seriously has to be
some sort of mistake.

315
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,020
I swear I didn't do it.

316
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,981
How many times do I have to tell you?

317
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,369
When are you gonna let me go?

318
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,162
Once you've answered all of our questions.

319
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,206
You dragged me here with no explanation

320
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,584
and asked me a bunch of questions
I don't know the answers to.

321
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,586
There's no way
this whole thing here is legal.

322
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,962
Pipe down, will you?

323
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,089
Given the situation,
we didn't need a warrant.

324
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,050
Even so, don't people
deserve basic human rights?

325
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,844
I mean, how can you do this?

326
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,138
There was no time for me
to even close up my shop.

327
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,016
Can we just go
and lock the doors at least?

328
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,184
Hey, fuckface!
You don't get it, do you?

329
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,645
Is this a joke to you, huh?

330
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,440
I don't think you understand
the amount of shit you're in.

331
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,821
Can I please have my phone call?

332
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,409
I have to ask a friend
to take care of my shop.

333
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,746
If my plants don't get watered,
they're gonna die.

334
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,664
Hmm.

335
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,625
Don't let this lying asshole
near any phones

336
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,793
-until he tells the truth, okay?
-Yes, sir.

337
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,378
Come in.

338
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,256
Hey.

339
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,925
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

340
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,553
Please cooperate.

341
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,014
Uh...

342
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,268
Open your mouth.

343
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:57,853
And say, "Ah."

344
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,147

347
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,416
Taejoong.

348
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,377
You look rough.

349
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,711
Are those real?

350
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,338
I mean, why would they make--

351
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,673
I've been through a lot of shit

352
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,466
-but this is a first.
-How are you holding up?

353
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,885
You need to be in handcuffs
just to talk with us?

354
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,929
They haven't taken them off me
since I got here.

355
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,976
So... how are you holding up?

356
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,852
You look like you haven't slept in days.

357
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,145
Yeah, I'm okay.

358
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,897
Actually, I'm not okay.

359
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,775
But seeing you guys
is helping me feel better.

360
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,777
Hey, could you guys do me a favor?

361
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,571
Can you ask the flower shop owner
to swing by my store

362
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,615
and check up on the plants for me?

363
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:52,700
A few days, max.

364
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,743
Tell her I'll make it up when I'm out.

365
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,245
Uh, Taejoong--

366
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,580
Man, the people here
must be deaf or something.

367
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,625
I don't know how many times
I have to tell them the truth.

368
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,419
-It's like they don't care.
-Taejoong, listen.

369
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,880
You probably don't know what's
going on since you're stuck in here.

370
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,133
But it's getting kind of crazy out there.

371
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,344
All your personal info
has been leaked online.

372
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,762
It's a total shitstorm.

373
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,140
What are you guys saying?

374
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,392
Don't worry too much about it.

375
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,019
Don't stress about it.

376
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,770
Everything will work itself out, okay?

377
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,439
So stay strong.

378
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,400
Wait, hold on.

379
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,736
What kind of personal information
has been leaked?

380
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,575
DIE, MURDERER

381
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,839
I'll get you released
by tomorrow, so sit tight.

382
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,090
Okay? Are you sure?

383
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,550
What do you want now?

384
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,636
When are you gonna let me out?

385
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,849
You must either be
a dumbass or delusional.

386
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,392
I said I didn't do it.

387
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,352
So why are you keeping me
locked up like an animal?

388
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,938
Saying you didn't kill her
doesn't mean shit.

389
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,857
We still have a dead victim.

390
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,692
What you need is proof.

391
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,818
Fucking liar.

392
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,779
Proof?

393
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,822
I've been telling you the truth.

394
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,033
What more do you want from me?

395
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,410
You fucking cops?
Think you could do whatever you want?

396
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,495
Huh?

397
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,998
When I get out,
I'm gonna sue the whole department!

398
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,292
Good luck.

399
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,045
Fucking nutcase!

400
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,685
The Chu case shines a light on the rise

401
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,188
of violent crimes
happening in the country.

402
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,607
Can you offer any insight
into the mind of this killer?

403
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,691
Of course.

404
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,820
Given his troubled upbringing,
lack of higher education,

405
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,405
and inability to hold a stable job,

406
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,326
his crime was an expression of rage
over being unable to integrate into--

407
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:10,212
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

408
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,923
CASE DELEGATION AGREEMENT
SONG SUJI

409
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,136
Give me time to look over everything.

410
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,304
Once that's done, I'll contact you. Okay?

411
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,722
Thanks for meeting with us.

412
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,599
-I'll be in touch.
-Thanks again.

413
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,811
What was that?

414
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,563
Who was that man you were just talking to?

415
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,022
He's our lawyer.

416
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,107
Suji hired him.

417
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,110
He mentioned the faster we move,
the better.

418
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,612
And I couldn't sit around and do nothing.

419
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,532
Where should I put these?

420
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,617
You can leave it there.

421
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,785
I'll sort them later.

422
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,203
All of us are here already.

423
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,788
I'll just help you out.

424
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,540
Did you bring these plants from the shop?

425
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,917
Yeah, reporters keep swarming the place.

426
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,836
I was worried they would knock them over.

427
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,423
I figured I'd move them here
to help Taejoong out.

428
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,009
Have you visited him yet?

429
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,471
I'll go see him today.

430
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,973
Hmm.

431
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,641
I think it's probably a good idea.

432
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,102
I'm sure that would comfort him.

433
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,772
Right.

434
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,470
It's all my fault that
you're going through this.

435
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,932
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,150
I still don't understand
why this is happening to me.

437
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:58,820
Is that all you have to say?

438
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,325
Anything you want to tell me.

439
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,911
You can be honest.

440
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,749
Suji, I...

441
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,919
I didn't do it. I swear I didn't.

442
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,974
I've been hoping
to hear those words.

443
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,772
I know you're not the kind
of person who would do that.

444
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,905
I promise I'll be fighting
for you out there.

445
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,657
So you can't give up in here.

446
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,039
Suji.

447
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,378
So you're saying that all we need to do

448
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,672
is prove that Taejoong
was busy doing something else

449
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,008
at the exact time of the victim's death?

450
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,217
That's correct.

451
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,386
He will need a solid alibi,

452
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,596
something that will hold up in court.

453
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,681
Look at this.

454
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,145
It seems the exact time of death
hasn't been determined yet.

455
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,982
We'd have to account for his exact
whereabouts during those two days.

456
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,026
That's nearly impossible.

457
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,821
Sir, please. Is there anything we can do?

458
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,409
Wait, I think it is possible.

459
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,912
When Taejoong works,
he barely takes any breaks.

460
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,998
It's like he can't waste a single moment.

461
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,291
That's true.

462
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,418
Also, don't they save
all the delivery records?

463
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,627
You're right.

464
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,337
-Let's see what we can find.
-Yeah.

465
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,256
We'll look into it and let you know.

466
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,258
-Don't worry too much, okay?
-See ya.

467
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,472
STATEMENT
PARK TAEJOONG

468

HANGANG RIVER MURDER CASE

469
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,268
You keep denying the allegations
in the police reports.

470
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,520
You positive you want to stick with that?

471
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,607
Why do you think I'm lying?

472
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,984
-What?
-Please, sir.

473
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,196
I don't understand
why I'm being forced to go to trial

474
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,447
for something I didn't do.

475
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,826
But I'll do everything I can
to prove my innocence.

476
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,498
Post-its.

477
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,874
-And photos. Maps.
-Right.

478
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,459
-Anything that'll help.
-Yeah, sounds good.

479
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,795
-Okay, come on. And receipts.
-Got it.

480
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,879
Okay.

481
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,965
From 8:00 a.m. on the 20th
to 10:00 p.m. the following night.

482
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,384
That's right. Would it be possible
to email me those records?

483
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,096
Everything, if that's all right.

484
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,556
Well, between noon
and three o'clock, I was...

485
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,682
in Yeonmi-dong.

486
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,310
Dowon Food, Maria Pizza, Byeol Coffee.

487
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,645
Oh, and the receipts,

488
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,688
I store all of them
in one of my kitchen drawers,

489
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,524
-just in case I need them.
-I'll find them.

490
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,359
-Receipts? Put 'em here.
-Yeah.

491
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,694
Good thing Taejoong
saved these in his kitchen drawer.

492
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:45,779
Whoa, dude.

493
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,114
How should we sort them?

494
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,740
-Let's do it by time slots.
-Okay.

495
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:49,825
I'll take ones at lunchtime.

496
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,243
Another one for dinner.

497
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,411
-Oh, wait. This one's lunch.
-Set it here.

498
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,580
What about this?

499
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,208
Hello, sir. By any chance,
do you know this guy?

500
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,292
Yeah, I do.

501
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,169
Do you have receipts
from when Taejoong covered...

502
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,921
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah, no worries.

503
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,005
-You get it?
-Yeah.

504
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,590
-Nice. Good work.
-Found one.

506
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,385
I appreciate you taking
the time to sign this.

507
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,512
I was so shocked
when I first heard the news.

508
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,431
-It's the least I could do for him.
-Thank you so much.

509
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,599
I couldn't find any.

510
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,892
What was the time slot?

511
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,018
-What about this?
-Papa Bread.

512
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,145
-Put it here.
-Okay.

TAEJOONG'S MOVEMENTS
ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

514
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,022
Here.

515
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,066
We don't have anything from 2:00 to 2:30.

516
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,235
Yeah.

517
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,319
Nothing in my pile.

518
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,406
-Strange.
-30 minutes.

519
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,659
Try to remember, Hyung. Think.

520
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,119
Wait, let me think.

521
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,038
What was I doing... after the delivery?

522
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,249
I remember. Okay, so...

523
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,876
My bike suddenly had a problem.

524
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,420
So after lunch, I had Kyungho fix it.

525
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,796
Yeah, that should be it.

526
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,467
-Look, there he is.
-Right.

527
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,886
-That's his bike.
-Just like he said.

528
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,679
Would you mind
if I take a picture of this?

529
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,724
A photo is not gonna be enough.

530
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,185
I'll make you a copy
of the video, all right? Video is better.

531
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,895
-Thank you so much.
-We appreciate it.

532
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:04,733
THE DAY BEFORE THE INCIDENT
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

533
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,151
How on earth...

534
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,861
I can't believe it.

535
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,865
This is impressive.

536
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,743
Man, as we were doing this,

537
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,537
it made me realize
how insanely hard he was working.

538
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,915
I don't understand
how he never took a single break.

539
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,379
With this kind of alibi,
we should be able to put up a good fight.

540
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,674
Actually, I think we can win this.

541
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,685
Would it be okay for me
to take some of this for the case?

542
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,229
-Take whatever you need.
-Yes, of course.

543
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,563
We can bring the rest to you later.

544
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,648
Yeah.

545
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,650
We got this.

546
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,860
Great job, everyone.

547
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:49,945
Yeah, you too.

548
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,696
Thanks for helping, guys.

549
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,573
-I mean it.
-Yeah, we got you.

550
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,453
Why wouldn't you at least
eat a proper meal?

551
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,339
COURT

552
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,842
All rise.

553
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,563
Please be seated.

554
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,906
We will now begin
case number 2020-98374.

555
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,952
The defendant, Park Taejoong
is being tried on the charges of murder,

556
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,955
mutilation of a corpse,
and abandonment of a body.

557
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,209
As you can see, the defendant,

558
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:49,587
Park Taejoong, is an ordinary,
functioning member of society.

559
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,674
I would say he lives a normal life.

560
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,011
Also, it's clear from the petitions alone

561
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,847
that he is held in high regard
by those around him.

562
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,642
Finally, it is obvious when reviewing
the timeline of the defendant,

563
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,395
that contrary to the prosecution's claim,

564
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,231
it would be impossible for my client
to have committed the crime,

565
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,859
dismember the victim
and dispose of the body.

566
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,487
This is irrefutable proof
that he is innocent.

567
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,780
I rest my case.

568
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,788
Prosecution, you have the floor.

569
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,709
Will the defendant please take a seat
at the witness stand?

570
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,676
WITNESS STAND

571
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,392
Right. So, similar to the defense,
we also followed the defendant's actions

572
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,519
and movements on the day of the incident.

573
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,565
This is the GPS tracking data
of the defendant's whereabouts

574
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,233
down to the second.

575
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,818
And, as you can see,

576
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,154
they match the timeline
presented by the defense.

577
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,199
So I have no objection
to the fact that the defendant

578
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,159
is a hardworking and sincere person.

579
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,870
In Article 27 of our Constitution,

580
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,954
in paragraph four,

581
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,999
it states that the accused
is innocent until proven guilty,

582
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,585
and when in doubt,
judgment favors the defendant.

583
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,798
Personally, I sincerely hope
that Park Taejoong is innocent.

584
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,758
I truly want to believe that.

585
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,636
However, there are issues that trouble me.

586
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,013
And if the defendant
could clear a few things up,

587
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,390
I'm sure we would all appreciate it.

588
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,641
Is that all right with you?

589
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,686
Yes.

590
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,981
Now, here's my first point of concern.

591
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,900
The records show

592
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,903
that the defendant made
a delivery to the victim's residence.

593
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:42,450
Of course, delivering to the victim's home
could be completely random,

594
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,577
especially since she lived
in the same district.

595
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,706
But it's the timeline of it
that confuses me.

596
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,584
From the time he arrived,
to the time he departed her home,

597
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:55,547
the duration of the delivery
was approximately seven minutes in total.

598
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,840
If you look here,

599
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,551
it was marked as a contactless delivery
to the third floor.

600
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,305
But isn't seven minutes
a little long for that?

601
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,243
Well, that's because...

602
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,162
I had to take care of a tree.

603
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,621
Could you be more specific?

604
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,039
Uh, yes.

605
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,375
it was a China doll tree.

606
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,960
It's considered a partial shade plant,

607
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,129
meaning they shouldn't
get too much sunlight.

608
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,257
As I was leaving, I saw that
it was placed in front of the window.

609
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,968
I couldn't help myself,
so I moved it into the shade

610
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,887
and left some tips for the owner.

611
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,057
That might be why it took me so long.
I left after that.

612
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,768
Hmm, I see.

613
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,019
Understood.

614
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,520
Moving on to the next question.

615
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,815
While tracking the defendant's movements,

616
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,027
we found this security footage.

617
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,570
Could you explain this for us?

618
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,030
EXHIBIT VIDEO 1) DEFENDANT'S MOVEMENTS

619
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,908
Excuse me, young man.
Could you lend a hand?

620
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,578
I was just...

621
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,997
I finished delivering jokbal
to a customer.

622
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,000
When I came back, I helped
an old woman with her suitcase.

623
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,127
So I did what anyone would do

624
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,171
and helped her
move her things up the hill.

625
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,721
By any chance... was it this suitcase?

626
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,681
Yes, looks like it.

627
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,810
That's strange.

628
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,311
Because this suitcase...

629
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,857
was found near the location
of where the body was discovered.

630
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,111
Forensic analysis confirmed
that this suitcase

631
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,197
was used to transport
the dismembered body.

632
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,406
Objection.

633
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,491
Right, I agree.

634
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,702
Just because the suitcase
appears to be the same model,

635
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,539
it doesn't prove that it was
the exact one used in the crime.

636
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:55,250
Also... we checked all the footage

637
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,128
and we only found a single video clip
of the defendant with the suitcase.

638
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,382
He doesn't appear
in any other location besides that.

639
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,426
It's possible, you, unintentionally,
moved through the blind spots.

640
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,678
The thing is...

641
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,514
how can someone know
the location of every camera,

642
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,100
unless they've gone through
these streets hundreds of times?

643
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,102
That would be impossible.

644
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,521
So I actually support
the objection, Your Honor.

645
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,274
Now, why were you
in possession of the victim's phone?

646
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,401
No, I was...

647
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,737
The elderly lady asked me
to help carry her things, so I...

648
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,656
Mr. Park Taejoong?

649
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,784
Why was the victim's phone
in your possession?

650
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,329
The phone? Uh...

651
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,332
I couldn't have had
the victim's phone, sir.

652
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,418
Is that right?

653

EXHIBIT VIDEO 2)
DEFENDANT SEEN HOLDING THE VICTIM'S PHONE

654
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,235
So that was...

655
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,613
I was... just...

656
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,782
I was eating... and I heard
the phone ring behind me, so...

657
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:13,286
I answered it, and then
I headed out to return it right away.

658
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,665
Where'd you return it?

659
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,001
Was it here?

660
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:22,629
Yes, that's right.

661
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,007
And actually,
they offered a reward for it.

CONVENIENCE STORE CCTV

663
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,098
So who did you return the phone to
if it wasn't the victim?

664
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,020
And why was her body
less than 40 meters away?

665
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,774
I don't know, because I never...

666
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,985
I didn't actually meet her.

667
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,112
She said she didn't want
a stranger to know where--

668
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,447
Defendant...

669
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,200
-Why do you keep lying to me?
-I'm not.

670
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,786
No, I swear I'm telling you the truth.

671
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,836
Now what you see
on the screen are the coordinates

672
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,755
from the GPS data of the victim's phone.

673
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,676
They almost match the movements
of the defendant perfectly.

674
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,928
Do you have some
explanation for this, too?

675
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,137
Because you just said...

676
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,098
that you returned it,

677
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,809
and yet it's obvious
that you had it with you all day.

678
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,022
I really don't know
how to explain any of that.

679
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,190
You don't know?

680
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,984
Maybe this will jog your memory.

681
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,945
During our investigation,

682
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,864
we conducted a forensic examination
at the site of the murder.

683
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,242
But due to the complex
nature of the crimes,

684
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,120
we did not receive the results
until earlier today.

685
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,955
Objection!

686
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,124
This evidence was not disclosed
during discovery.

687
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,500
Please strike it.

688
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:44,836
Overruled.

689
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,421
-You may proceed.
-Right.

690
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,090
Mr. Park.

691
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,342
I still want to be on your side.

692
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,553
But all the evidence
keeps pointing to you.

693
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,975
LIKELY LOCATION OF THE MURDER

694
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,189
The victim was discovered in the bathroom
of a vacant unit on another floor

695
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,108
somewhere else in the building.

696
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,736
Brutally murdered,
then dismembered by the culprit

697
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:10,862
with no remorse.

698
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,031
The prosecution believes
that the perpetrator

699
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,700
placed her lifeless body in warm water

700
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,244
in order to manipulate the time of death.

701
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,330
Furthermore, bodily fluids
presumed to belong to the culprit

702
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,458
were found inside the victim's body.

703
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,980
If you would be so kind
as to read aloud

704
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,399
whose semen was identified in the report?

705
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,495
This can't...

706
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,872
PARK TAEJOONG, VICTIM'S EVIDENCE SAMPLE

707
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,585
You said you spent
seven minutes caring for a plant.

708
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,879
Sure you weren't filling
the bathtub with warm water?

709
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,090
It seems like that would have
taken seven minutes.

710
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,174
I...

711
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,594
It... It wasn't me.

712
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,055
I didn't do it.

713
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,475
I swear I didn't do it!

714
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,768
Mr. Park...

715
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,438
If you feel even the slightest bit
of guilt toward the victim,

716
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,649
you could at least tell us why you did it.

717
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,276
What did she do to deserve
such a horrific death?

718
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,112
No, Suji. I didn't.

719
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,119
Sir, please listen to me. I'm innocent.

720
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,329
It wasn't me, I swear!

721
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,831
-I didn't kill her!
-Maintain order.

722
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,166
-Your Honor, you have to believe me.
-Sit down, defendant.

723
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,960
It's not me. I didn't do it!

724
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,462
I... Wait, wait! Let go of me!

725
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,257
Your Honor, I'm begging you.

726
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,134
Please, believe me.

727
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,969
Oh, also...

728
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,804
That tree that you mentioned...

729
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,557
We asked the tenants about it,

730
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,934
and not a single one of them
had ever seen it.

731
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,853
Perhaps this was just your imagination.

732
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,230
Your Honor. No, wait.

733
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,773
I swear I'm telling the truth!

734
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,233
Let go! Wait!

735
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,484
It's not me!

736
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,111
I didn't do it.

737
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,406
Order! Order in the court!

738
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,659
-Your Honor, it wasn't me!
-This court will recess.

739
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,859
I have bad news.

740
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,277
Your lawyer quit.

741
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,739
Taejin is doing his best
to look for a new one,

742
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,033
but no luck so far.

743
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,787
He said we had a real chance of winning.

744
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,583
The sentencing hearing
is around the corner.

745
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,091
Suji.

746
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,094
I'm so sorry.

747
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,641
I'm sorry for everything.

748
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,436
Show me your right wrist, please.

749
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,313
What?

750
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,773
Where's the bracelet?

751
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:35,858
The one I gave you.

752
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,031
Oh...

753
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,700
Last I remember, I was wearing it.

754
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,118
-But--
-Where is it?

755
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,121
Where'd it go?

756
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,625
I'm sorry. I was so out of it, and...

757
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,753
Why are you bringing that up?

758
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:00,508
Why?

759
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,596
Why don't you have
the bracelet I gave you?

760
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,230
Trust me.

761
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,983
I know in my heart that you didn't do it,

762
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,236
and that you could never do such a thing.

763
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,154
But if I find out...

764
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,159
-that there's a side of you I don't know--
-Hey, Su...

765
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,577
Suji, what are you...

766
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,538
What are you trying to say?

767
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,415
The lawyer told us...

768
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,793
that you have to show true remorse

769
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,963
in order to receive a lighter sentence.

770
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,059
Please, just tell me.

771
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:53,936
Tell me not to wait for you.

772
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,107
You know I'm not good at waiting.

773
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,609
Suji.

774
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,777
Suji.

775
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,405
It wasn't me, okay? I...

776
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,282
I didn't do it.

777
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,783
Please don't give up on me.

778
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:42,313
The Manipulated
