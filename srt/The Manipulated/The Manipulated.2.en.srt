00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,839
Wake up time is 6:20 a.m.

3
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,342
After morning roll call,
you go to breakfast.

4
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,928
Inmates with court hearings
prepare for departure.

5
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,013
Everyone else goes
to their assigned labor.

6
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,432
Exercises held
in the morning and afternoon.

7
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,309
Cells are locked at 5:30 p.m.,

8
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,770
followed by evening
roll call and then dinner.

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,146
Lights out at 9:00 p.m.

10
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,942
Remember, hot water
is turned on once a week.

11
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,530
If you behave yourself
and follow the rules,

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,865
you'll earn a Level One classification

13
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,951
and receive
a padded jacket for the winter.

14
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,328
You may even be granted parole later on.

15
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,539
If you're going to be in here a while,

16
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,460
I would recommend that you take time
to reflect on the choices you have made.

17
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,670
Next person.

18
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,547
When the day finally comes

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,258
for you to wear
your civilian clothes again,

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,552
I hope by then you'll be a changed man.

LAWYER
KIM SANGRAK

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,312
I'm a public defender.

24
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,148
I'm not some hotshot lawyer.

25
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,985
I had a chance to look over your case.

26
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,362
Something caught my eye.

27
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,327
They ruled out all other suspects
from the beginning.

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,871
Everything was very calculated.

29
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,873
It was almost as if they were...

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,666
following the script.

31
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,210
I, uh...

32
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,175
I've never seen Chu Nayoung before.

33
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,053
I promise I'm not lying.

34
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,889
Still...

35
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,061
Nobody believes me at all.

36
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,396
I don't agree with the prosecution.

37
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,107
That's why I wanted to speak with you.

38
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,234
Please.

39
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,320
Please help me, sir. I'm begging you.

40
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,114
I'm telling you the truth.
I swear, I didn't lay a finger on her!

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,826
Hmm.

42
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,337
Think. Is there anything

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,423
that might be able to corroborate
your version of what happened?

44
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,801
You've had plenty of time
to think it over.

45
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,969
Uh... Uh...

46
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,054
That's all right.

47
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,932
Try to think through it carefully.

48
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,600
Down to the tiniest detail.

49
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,644
Okay, any details.

50
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,730
Come to think of it,
there was one thing that stood out.

51
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,233
And it was really concerning.

52
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,485
-What was it?
-Well...

53
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,320
during the trial,

54
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,989
I was really out of it,
so I didn't say anything.

55
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,200
They said they found
a bracelet at the scene, right?

56
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,743
EXHIBIT PHOTO 2

57
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,163
Someone else left that.

58
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,998
I don't know who but it's not mine.

59
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,168
I mean, I've never been there before,
so there's no way it could be mine.

60
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,796
My bracelet...

61
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,049
My bracelet...

62
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,802
It fell off in Taejin's room that night.

63
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,595
-Keep studying.
-I stopped by.

64
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,347
I took a short nap at his place.

65
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,766
Then I went straight out
for my delivery shift.

66
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,355
Are you sure?

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
Yes.

68
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm sure.

69
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,986
Then we'll need to look into that.

70
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,906
Do you think that now, with this proof,

71
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,285
they'll finally admit I didn't do it?

72
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,787
And that I'm actually not a killer?

73
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,709
We can definitely open
a new angle of investigation.

74
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,504
Now give me the address
of where your brother is staying.

75
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,589
I'll look into it.

76
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,175
Oh, and just to be safe,

77
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,928
don't tell anyone that
we're looking into your case again.

78
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,013
-Understood?
-Okay.

79
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,474
Thank you so much, sir.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,768
I really appreciate it.

81
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,821
Ah!

82
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,657
Wait, wait. Officer!

83
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,494
-Officer! Please, wait!
-Get in.

84
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,673
Get in there, you little punk!

85
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,133
I said get the fuck in there!

86
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,885
Let's go, you son of a bitch! Get in here!

87
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,054
Get in! On your knees, asshole!

88
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,222
Sit down!

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,232
How many years did you get?

90
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,736
Something wrong?

91
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,577
Hey, hey, hey. Where do you
think you're going? Come here!

92
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,038
-Stay down and shut up.
-Ah!

93
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,043
Where are you running off to?

94
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,963
Planning on locking yourself
in your room or something?

95
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,049
Now listen up.

96
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,760
If you force me to repeat myself again,

97
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,262
I'll cut off that hand of yours

98
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,180
and use it as a soccer ball.

99
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,265
Ah!

100
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,187
So how many years did you get?

101
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,191
I... I'm in here for life.

102
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,194
Wow, you messed up big time, didn't ya?

103
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,280
What for?

104
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,826
Why? Are you ashamed?

105
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,745
Ashamed to say you raped a girl,

106
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,038
cut her up,

107
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,583
and dumped her body in the river?

108
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,377
I didn't.

109
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,590
I didn't do it.

110
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,347
Hey, get out of here!

111
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,933
Enough chit chat. Let's go!

112
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,024
I'll see you around.

113
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,359

114
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,923
Hey.

115
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,676
I hear you just met the boss.

116
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,262
You're really screwed now.

117
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,348
I heard you raped someone, right?

118
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,016
Did you like it?

119
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,977
Yeah. You liked it?

120
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,229
You want me to give you
something you'll enjoy?

121
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,191
You enjoying this, huh?

122
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,443
Hey, why the hell aren't you answering me?

123
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,944
What? Can't you talk?

124
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,781
Look at me and I'll kill you,
you little piece of shit!

125
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,825
These bastards always come in

126
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,079
and they have no respect
and no manners towards their seniors.

127
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,373
Seriously, this son of a bitch. Shit.

Ah.

132
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,644
You'd better pay me back soon.

133
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,855
Otherwise, the interest
will keep on growing.

134
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,861
Eat up now!

135
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
Ah.

136
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,662
Do you want me to spoon feed you?

137
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,414
Yeah!

138
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,638
Hey, move. Hey.

139
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,682
Stop it! Quit staring at him.

140
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,350
That guy over there is no joke.

141
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,228
Damn, your face is really messed up.

142
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,772
That guy is Yeo Deoksu.

143
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,692
He's in charge here.
He's got operations outside too.

144
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,028
When he got here, he was doing life.

145
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,655
But that asshole was filthy rich,

146
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,490
and he got it reduced to 12 years.

147
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,951
Hey, hey, come here.

148
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,165
Yeo Deoksu used to have a little sister.

149
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,625
But then some bastard
stuck it to her and killed her.

150
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,335
S... Stuck it?

151
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,088
Stuck it to her?

152
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,050
What are you? Some kind of prude?

153
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,301
Stuck it, you know?

154
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,597
That's why you're here, right?

155
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,391
Yeo Deoksu...
he's famous for tearing apart guys

156
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,518
who come in for that kind of thing.

157
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,812
Until they get out of here, it's hell.

158
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,441
I'll help you out, all right.

159
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,402
Don't worry. Come on, have some food.

160
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,404
Here. You like potatoes?

161
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,366
I'll tell you more after we eat, okay?

162
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,705
Hey, it's all right.

163
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,916
-It's okay. It's okay. Let's just talk.
-Yeah. It's okay.

164
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,584
-We just wanna talk.
-What are we doing here?

165
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,127
Don't worry. It's just Yeo Deoksu.

166
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,921
Hey, don't worry. Everything's fine.

167
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,173
Too bad you're on his bad side.

168
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,549
No. no, no.

169
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,884
Finally.

170
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,095
Hey, stay still!

171
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,972
Whoo!

172
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,851
It's been a while.

173
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,103
Let's stick it to him.

174
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,023
Stop it! Don't do this!

I'm sorry I couldn't do anything.

183
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,391
CHU NAYOUNG MURDER CASE

184
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,575
I'm coming.

185
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,452
Hey, you.

186
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,537
What are you doing?

187
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,080
Huh?

188
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,707
What are you doing here, huh?

189
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,251
Where you headed, huh?

190
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,711
Hey, wait up.

191
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,421
Hey! Wait up!

192
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,996
Taejoong.

193
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,296
You really learned a lot

194
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,006
-from following Mom around.
-Hmm?

195
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,474
When we were younger,
we learned how to do this together.

196
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,144
And yet why is it that my plants
always die so easily?

197
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,230
My Hoya Lisas are already dead.

198
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,024
Well, that's because
you're impatient, Taejin.

199
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,235
-You think?
-Yeah.

200
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,280
If you keep watering them like that
before the leaves dry,

201
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,699
then, of course, they're gonna die on you.

202
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,952
Even so, it's like you have this gift.

203
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,746
You bring them back to life
even after they're dead.

204
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,040
You want to know?

205
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,084
Here's the thing.

206
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,211
All you have to do
is take the root cuttings

207
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,005
from the ones that survived. Uh...

208
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,589
Now that won't work with the other plants.

209
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,341
But, oddly enough,

210
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,926
it does seem to work with Hoyas.

211
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,219
Impressive, huh?

212
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,890
They're tough as hell... just like you.

213
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,393
Come on.

214
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,896
Once I can get it to take root,

215
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,482
I'll move this one to a new pot for you.

216
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,942
But after that...

217
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,153
take good care of it, okay? Don't kill it.

218
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,077
Tell me.

219
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,371
Why did you do it?

220
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,040
Do what?

221
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,877
You brought everything else back to life.

222
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,754
So then why did you kill yourself?

223
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,303
Taejin.

224
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,347
Go.

225
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:11,893
Leave me alone!

226
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,104
Get away from me! Just go!

227
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,440
Hold him.

228
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,865
Keep pressure on it.

229
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,949
Okay.

230
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,244
Hang on a second.
I've seen that guy before.

231
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,746
Oh, don't get me started.

232
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,915
This is his third suicide attempt
this month.

233
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,334
So, conventional
therapy isn't working.

234
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,836
We're currently using
other treatments. It's not easy.

235
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,186
Let's go.

236
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,191
The inmate has refused visitation.

237
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,193
Can't you make the request one more time?

238
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,028
No, please come back another day.

239
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,573
All right, then we'll come back.

240
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,991
Let's go. That's enough.

241
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,744
We've been coming here
every month for over a year

242
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,329
and he's refused every single visit?

243
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,206
That's a bit extreme, don't you think?

244
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,375
I'm sure Taejoong has his own reasons.

245
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,294
-We should go now. All right?
-I want to know what the reason is.

246
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,297
This guy keeps saying he doesn't want
to see us, and it's bullshit.

247
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,800
-Come on, let's get going.
-Can't you just try one more time?

248
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,302
I mean, we have a right
to know what's going on, please!

249
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,471
We can come back later. Sorry.

250
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,790
-Happy Easter.
-Here you are.

251
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,125
-Thank you very much.
-Sure.

252
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,252
Thank you.

253
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,712
Happy Easter. Enjoy.

254
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,856
Today is Easter Sunday.

255
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,401
I asked Father for permission
to let me eat with you.

256
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,541
I saw you crying
while I was exercising in the yard.

257
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,044
I bet they make fun of you for that.

258
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,922
Saying a grown man
shouldn't cry in front of others.

259
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,925
But in here, we have no choice.

260
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,677
There's no personal space
once you're in prison.

261
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,307
Taejoong.

262
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,602
Park Taejoong!

263
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,323
My name is Noh Yongsik.

264
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,492
But everyone calls me the altar guy.

265
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,914
I have some cake.

266
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,666
It's pretty good.

267
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,932
During mass...

268
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,561
the person who assists the priest
is called an altar server.

269
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,193
And come to think of it,
I've been an altar server for...

270
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,822
fifteen years already.

271
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,158
Even then, I'm still not used to it.

272
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,331
I guess it takes quite a while.

273
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,961
The metal beds we sleep on,

274
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,088
the sound of the iron doors,

275
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,967
the fences wrapped in high voltage wires,

276
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,637
and that cold, narrow strip
of concrete they call the floor.

277
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,514
No matter how much time passes,

278
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,642
it never feels like home.

279
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,272
Despite all of that,

280
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,567
you'll have to adjust quickly.

281
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,279
I don't think you realize yet...

282
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,534
that this is a prison.

283
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,585
I remember how terrified I felt
when I first arrived.

284
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,962
I was miserable.

285
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,965
I felt furious, like I had been wronged.

286
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,217
For the first few months,

287
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,762
I could hardly breathe
under the weight of it all.

288
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,848
But we have to continue.

289
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,394
We have to survive.

290
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,573
DAILY SCHEDULE

291
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,034
Life can feel
pretty empty in prison.

292
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,663
But remember that even this life
is a gift from God.

293
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,289
So don't waste it.

294
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,126
Use this time to reflect on your past

295
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,712
and to discover your purpose here.

296
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,423
Man, you're slow.

297
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,675
You can punch faster that that, can't you?

298
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,594
Take up something

299
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,263
you've always wanted to try.

300
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,765
If you're out of shape,

301
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,977
then work out as much as you can.

302
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,061
CERTIFICATION TEST

303
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,397
If you slacked off in school,

304
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,232
now's your chance to study.

305
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,196
The most important thing
is that you keep yourself busy

306
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,406
while you're here.

307
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,076
If you can do that,
then these first few years,

308
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,996
which I know feel impossible to endure,

309
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,083
will start to become more bearable.

310
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,128
And then one day, you'll look up

311
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,547
and you'll wonder
where all that time has gone.

312
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,976
Time is the greatest enemy

313
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,562
that you'll ever have to face
while you're in here.

314
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,031
The secret is, the only way to defeat time
is to surrender to it.

315
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,908
SIT-UPS

316
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,327
PUSH-UPS
SHADOW JUMPING

317
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,165
Hey, let's grab something to eat.

318
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,923
2802.

319
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,467
SIT-UPS

320
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,135
PUSH-UPS
SHADOW JUMPING

321
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:06,992
Hold him still.

322
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,250
So, you think you're tough now?

323
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,376
How's that?

324
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,177
A gift for you.

325
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,054
Learn to trust in the Lord.

326
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,687
The Lord will help you build the strength
and resilience that you need to survive.

327
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,398
And in reading his words,

328
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,942
you will learn how
to reflect on your sins.

329
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,746
It's good to see you eating well.

330
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,459
Hey!

331
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,675
2802.

332
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,076
5 YEARS LATER

333
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,682
It's a very good thing that
you called me right away.

334
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,104
It'll give me more time
to handle the situation.

335
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,777
I'll make it seem
as if it never even happened.

336
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,905
Just think of it as a security detail.

337
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,199
And once it's all over,

338
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,618
you and I, Mr. Chairman,

339
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,411
will be the closest friends.

340
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,717
Every time I come here,
more plants are sprouting.

341
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,513
Hey, why don't you plant
some edible stuff over here, hmm?

342
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,433
Vegetable prices have gone up a lot.

343
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,398
That scar on your face
never seems to go away.

344
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,651
Are the other prisoners
harassing you again?

345
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,613
I must have stepped on
someone else's vegetables.

346
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,616
Don't worry, it's no big deal.

347
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:37,995
All right.

348
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,707
Everyone needs a little turf of their own.

349
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,167
But with that said,

350
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,545
I still prefer your turf to theirs. Hmm.

351
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,464
They can try all they want.

352
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,383
They'll just make things
harder on themselves.

353
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,096
Here, look.

354
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,849
Someone recently
gave this to me as a gift.

355
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,604
But then last week, these black spots
started showing up all over.

356
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,897
Have you seen this before?

357
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,279
I guess it isn't very common.

358
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,948
It's nutrient deficiency.

359
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,206
They gave you a sun-loving plant.

360
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,375
So if you're keeping it indoors,
it won't survive.

361
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,169
Ah.

362
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,298
Leave it with me. I'll make sure
it gets better and I'll repot it for you.

363
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,052
But you have to bring me
a larger pot, okay?

364
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,639
All right, so...
it needs a bigger pot to grow.

365
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,725
Okay.

366
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,313
I had a feeling
I knew you'd know how to take care of it.

367
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,150
Thank you.

368
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,655
Hello.

369
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,374
Well...

370
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,752
who would have thought you'd end up
becoming a doctor of plants, huh?

371
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,839
Oh, here.

372
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,882
-What is this?
-Tada!

373
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,759
What's the occasion, hmm?

374
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,678
Is there some special holiday
I don't know about?

375
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,472
I asked Father to get one for me
when he came by today.

376
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,350
-Hmm. Enjoy.
-Mmm.

377
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,772
I think that if you stay here too long,

378
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,149
-you just start to wither away.
-Hmm.

379
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,195
The guys all brag about
the things that they did,

380
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,155
talking about their priors, as if...

381
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,323
they're proud of it.

382
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,575
Like a badge of honor.

383
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,953
They forget they're supposed to be atoning
for the crimes they committed.

384
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,206
Taejoong.

385
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,584
I hope you stay exactly as you are.

386
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,755
You seem...

387
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,675
off today, you know?

388
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,552
Oh, really?

389
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,513
Hey, give me your hand.

390
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,348
Huh?

391
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,854
They say you use soap
to wash the dirt off your skin

392
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,607
and tears to wash away
the sins from your heart.

393
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,360
I don't really know
what's in your heart, Taejoong, but...

394
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,988
I hope your days
of shedding tears are behind you.

395
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,994
Uh, why are you acting so weird?

396
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,873
I mean, is everything okay?

397
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,251
I...

398
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,589
I'm... getting out today.

399
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:41,929
Uh-huh.

400
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,473
Oh.

401
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,477
Oh, and I already spoke to Father.

402
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,228
I told him today was my last day.

403
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,733
Which means you'll have to be
his new altar server from now on.

404
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,817
Mmm-hmm.

405
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,864
Go on.

406
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,076
This is really great news.

407
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,872
Do you have any idea what you're gonna do
once you get out of here?

408
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,585
My dad used to repair electronics,
so I thought I might give that a shot.

409
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,670
Hmm.

410
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,632
I didn't realize
you could still make a living

411
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,759
off a thing like that, I'm surprised.

412
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,511
Well, I have to do something.

413
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,646
You could save up some money
and help me open the shop.

414
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,730
Hmm?

415
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,692
-Finish.
-Okay.

416
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,700
Looks like spring's
coming early this year.

417
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,123
Hey, there's something
I always wanted to ask you.

418
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,670
Why were you so good to me?

419
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,883
I thought you were the one
being good to me.

420
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,593
Wasn't that how it always was?

421
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,762
Not true.

422
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,305
You were nice from the start.

423
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,518
But what would you have done
if I turned out to be a weirdo?

424
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,604
Well...

425
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,399
I just...

426
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,111
I just wanted to make sure
you kept on living.

427
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,864
I think that's why.

428
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,727
No one else would listen
to what I had to say.

429
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,937
You were the only one.

430
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,523
Thank you for that.

431
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,863
Let's go.

432
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,531
Yes.

433
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,992
Now, get going.

434
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,882
Noh Yongsik!

435
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,802
Huh?

436
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,304
Thank you for everything.

437
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,775
I'll see you.

438
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,931
"He who covers his sins will not prosper,

439
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,517
"but whoever confesses
and forsakes them will have mercy."

440
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,060
THE HOLY BIBLE

441
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,903
Ha, whoa! Look at this guy.

442
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,280
Nice moves, huh?

443
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,037
What are you looking at?

444
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,102
Hmm.

445
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,354
Come on. It's okay.

446
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,212
Eat it.

447
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,880
It's technically not allowed,

448
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,634
so I didn't want the others
to see you and get the wrong idea.

449
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,221
It's difficult...

450
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,474
getting used to living here.

451
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,434
I know it can be scary,

452
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,270
but that's only natural.

453
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,689
Who wouldn't be scared of prison?

454
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,150
Now, I don't...

455
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,861
want to pressure you or anything.

456
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,743
But here...

457
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,038
consider believing in God.

458
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,251
God will give you...
the strength to endure.

459
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,087
And he'll give you courage.

460
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,634
I've done nothing wrong.

461
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,097
Listen, what I really want to say is--

462
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,976
If only I hadn't gone to the park
to find the owner of that phone...

463
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,397
then I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

464
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:33,738
What phone?

465
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,160
Someone used it to frame me
for a crime I didn't commit.

466
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,045
I found this lost phone

467
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,715
and the lady said she'd pay me
if I delivered it to her.

468
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,300
You just bring it to me yourself.

469
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,635
I'll pay you 300,000 won for your trouble.

470
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,471
The whole thing was caught
on security cameras

471
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,265
and was used against me in court.

472
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,817
They found my belongings and fingerprints
at this hideout that I'd never been to.

473
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,244
I swear to God,
I've never been to that place before.

474
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,710
I thought my alibi would be strong enough.

475
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,759
This public defender came looking for me,
saying that he wanted to help me.

476
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,302
LAWYER
KIM SANGRAK

477
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,511
LAWYER
KIM SANGRAK

478
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,805
I'm a public defender.

479
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,725
I'm not some hotshot lawyer.

480
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,602
He said there's no proof.

481
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,270
No record of it.

482
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,151
That fucking bastard.

483
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,403
I'm sure he was one of them.
I know he was.

484
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,948
Oh, and just to be safe,

485
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,951
don't tell anyone
that we're looking into your case.

486
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,204
Then today,

487
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,874
I was told my mom committed suicide.

488
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,919
Everything is too overwhelming.

489
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,255
STUDY WITH ME
GOAL 5 HOURS

490
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,091
VIDEO CANNOT BE PLAYED

491
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,677
She always told me
there's no salvation for suicide.

492
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,099
She'd say life itself is a gift
and spend your time on what truly matters.

493
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,351
I know my mother.
She wouldn't kill herself.

494
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,437
Those bastards think they can fool me.

495
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,315
I see right through their lies.

496
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,608
Every single one of them.

497
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,360
They won't get away with this!

498
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,613
I know what they did.

499
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,647
Over here!

500
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,649
-Get inside.
-What happened?

501
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:15,734
Over here!

502
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,527
Is he breathing?

503
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,447
-What happened to him?
-It's a shame.

504
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,284
He stuffed pages from the Bible
into his mouth and suffocated.

505
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,332
Get him into the infirmary.

506
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,584
It's been a while.

507
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,504
So you have new information?

508
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,298
That's great.

509
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,301
Tell me about it. What is it?

510
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,680
Mr. Park?

511
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,433
Can you tell me what it is?

512
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,730
One of the new inmates
killed himself earlier today.

513
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,401
But before that, he told me
that you had offered to help him.

514
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,362
Is that right?

515
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,448
Uh, yes.

516
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,867
I heard about that.

517
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,745
I was afraid he would do
something like this.

518
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,913
I wanted to help him.

519
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,624
If I gave you new evidence,

520
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,001
will you actually help me?

521
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,838
Yes, of course I will.
That's what I'm here for.

522
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,507
And how are you gonna do that?

523
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,719
Well, I need to know what you have.

524
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:07,929
Tell me this new information.

525
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,390
Look at me.

526
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,144
What do you see when you look at me?

527
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,522
Is this the face
of a cold-blooded murderer?

528
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,234
Or someone framed to look like one?

529
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,991
Mr. Park, what are you doing right now?

530
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,287
Do you think I want to be wasting my time?

531
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,957
Did you tell him
the news about his mother?

532
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,835
That she committed suicide?

533
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,176
You don't have any information, do you?

534
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,847
Did you also tell them
that when you went to see her...

535
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,019
-she was already dead?
-You lied to me.

536
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:00,982
You have no evidence.

537
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,285
My brother didn't kill himself, did he?

538
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,750
So who was it?

539
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,712
Huh?

540
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,132
You son of a bitch!

541
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,800
-Answer me!
-Hey, get in, get in!

542
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,595
Who killed my brother? Who killed Taejin?

543
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,513
Hey, hey! Get off!

544
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,932
Hey!

545
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,600
Get off of him!

546
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,435
What do you think you're doing, punk?

547
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,396
-Grab him! Here, grab him! Hold him down!
-It's all right.

548
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,773
Let him go.

549
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:48,446
What? It's been years,
and you still haven't moved on?

550
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
Seriously?

551
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,702
Fine.

552
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,371
Let's say you're right.

553
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,956
And someone really wanted to frame you.

554
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,292
So they planted
that phone there on purpose

555
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,378
to make sure that
you were caught on camera

556
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,004
and you fell for it all.

557
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,384
-And then they erased all the evidence...
-It was here all along.

558
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,594
SUJI
TAEJOONG'S BRACELET...

559
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,307
...and they killed your brother.

560
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,230
Everything is too overwhelming.

561
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,901
What difference does it make?

562
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,278
Huh?

563
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,574
Man, you've got to let this thing go.

564
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,953
It would be easier
to convince yourself that you did it.

565
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,999
Out there, murder is a crime,
but in here it's like a badge of honor.

566
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,796
Hey, if you think about it,
your brother died because of you.

567
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,173
It's your fault he's dead,
fucking dumbass!

568
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,801
Who killed Taejin?

569
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,680
Did you do it?

570
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,224
Yes.

571
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,851
I killed Taejin.

572
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,060
You...

573
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,021
I swear to God...

574
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,732
I am gonna find a way to kill you.

575
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,817
You're fucking dead!

576
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:10,820
Locked in here?

577
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,822
And how are you gonna do that?

578
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,667
Here's a piece of advice.

579
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,880
Why don't you write a suicide note,
then hang yourself?

580
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,506
You never know...

581
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,593
they could reopen the case.

582
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,978
He's all yours. We're done.

583
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,618
PUBLIC SERVICE DESK

584
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,164
We've been compromised.

585
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,415
I think we need cleanup.

586
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,919
Argh! Son of a bitch!

587
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,190
Yes? What's going on?

588
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,400
What's the emergency?

589
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,694
Sorry for calling so late.

590
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,072
I... needed to tell you something.

591
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:38,658
From now on...

592
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,536
"HOLY BIBLE"

593
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,455
...I can no longer be your altar server.

594
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,790
Why not?

595
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,208
Are you feeling unwell?

596
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,628
There's something
Noh Yongsik once told me.

597
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,590
I must think of myself as already dead.

598
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,178
And consider this new life
a gift from God.

599
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,063
If you think about it,
your brother died because of you.

600
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,941
It's your fault he's dead,
fucking dumbass.

601
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,484
I swear to God,

602
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,070
I am gonna find a way to kill you.

603
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,881
