1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,957
The Manipulated

2
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,223
TO PARK TAEJOONG

3
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,196
Shit.

4
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,701
Son of a bitch!

5
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,338
A GIFT HAS ARRIVED

6
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,633
PARK TAEJOONG
RAPE, MURDER

7
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,514
LOL

8
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,434
BAEK DOKYUNG IS THE REAL CULPRIT

9
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,775
NOW FIND BAEK DOKYUNG

10
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,736
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT

11
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,796
Now it's time to follow the right path,
Park Taejoong.

12
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,562
BAEK DOKYUNG

13
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,272
Well, now, this should be fun.

14
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,857
Hope you're ready, Dokyung.

15
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,236
Sorry, but he needed the incentive.

16
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,113
He'll make his way over to you.

17
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,241
ACCOUNT PRIVACY
PRIVATE ACCOUNT

18
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,452
SWITCH TO PUBLIC

19
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,377
Hopefully he'll figure it all out quickly.

20
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,674
Now let the best man win.

21
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,729
I'M IN BUSAN!
EVERYONE GATHER

22
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,536
Uh, we tried for two years.

23
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,372
Same result every time.

24
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,125
We kept visiting,
but Taejoong always refused.

25
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,127
So we've never even met with him once.

26
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,504
I don't hold it against him, though.

27
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,005
If I were in a prison uniform,

28
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,716
I wouldn't want my friends
to see me in it either.

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,927
Yeah, but we've known
each other for so long.

30
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,471
It's not like we'd abandon him
for something like that.

31
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,307
I understand why
he wouldn't want us to visit.

32
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,726
It would make him feel worse
to be a burden.

33
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,439
I'm touched that you all speak so highly
of a guy who committed murder,

34
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,898
like he's still your friend.

35
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,777
Detective. You act like you know him,
but you don't.

36
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,362
We've been his friends forever.

37
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,114
Which is honestly why

38
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,408
we know for a fact
that he isn't a criminal.

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,617
How supportive.

40
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,829
He's lucky to have friends like you.

41
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,166
Sorry, why are you asking us
these types of things?

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,877
Why don't you go
ask him about it yourself?

43
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,422
Well, actually, protocol dictates
that we need to cover our bases--

44
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,049
Wait. Did something bad
happen to him, sir?

45
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,509
-Well...
-Don't worry.

46
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,553
We have everything under control.

47
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,347
If anything strange happens,
let me know right away.

48
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,767
Keep in touch, okay?

49
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,811
How fucking useless.

50
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,314
Sorry to intrude. I appreciate the coffee.

51
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,068
Weird.

52
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,446
What's his problem?

53
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,079
Hello?

54
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,999
What happens
when I catch the real killer?

55
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,125
Park Taejoong?

56
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,466
Listen, you piece of shit!

57
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,134
-Hey! Give me back my--
-Back off!

58
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,722
Smoking in the Busan Express
Bus Terminal is prohibited.

59
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,557
Thank you for your cooperation

60
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,726
and for using
the Busan Express Bus Terminal.

61
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,269
Fucking found him.

62
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,687
Let's go.

63
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,898
Hello... Uh...

64
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,067
But where are we going?

65
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,193
Busan.

66
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,862
Let Busan Terminal know
we're on our way there.

67
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,270
The Manipulated

68
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,365
Shit, I missed.

69
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,700
Hey, my bad.

70
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,577
Bring it here.

71
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,713
Hmm.

72
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,096
You thought I wouldn't find you?

73
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,848
I'm so sorry, sir.

74
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,225
Please forgive me.

75
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,145
If I do that,
think of what the others will say.

76
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,606
"It's fine if we betray that guy."

77
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,524
"Don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen."

78
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,526
We can't have that.

79
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,861
Don't do this, please.

80
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,656
Okay. Stand up.

81
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,665
I'll keep you alive, okay?

82
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,208
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

83
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,668
Just spar me a little.

84
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,295
Ready?

85
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,262
What's he up to?

86
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,686
Are you having fun without me again?

87
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,566
Well, I thought you were
in a different country by now.

88
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,485
The old man keeps telling me to go.

89
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,028
I don't feel like it.

90
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,616
Also, what would you do
without me?

91
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,909
You're right.

92
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,077
I'm glad you're here.

93
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,204
Let's go have a drink downstairs.

94
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,009
When the hell are you
gonna open this place?

95
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,974
I feel like my investment's being wasted.

96
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,062
All the money I've pooled
from the other guys isn't enough.

97
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,773
I need help getting to the finish line.

98
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,859
You asshole. All you ever want to do
is talk about money.

99
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,405
Hey, I got you something.

100
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,622
Whoa!

101
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,959
This is some good quality shit.

102
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,043
Fuck, yeah!

103
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,936
Hurry up and open this place already.

104
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,440
Trust me.

105
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,609
I'll do whatever it takes
to get what I need,

106
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,695
you woodpecker-looking motherfucker.

107
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,448
Yeah, yeah.
Just let me know how much you want.

108
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,908
Really?

109
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,872
I never doubted you.

110
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,541
I'm in the mood to party.

111
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,127
Get the biggest ship ready.

112
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,129
Okay, you got it.

113
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,964
Let's get wild tonight.

114
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,684
ELECTRONICS REPAIR SHOP

115
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,899
Why are you pacing around?

116
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,525
Did you get robbed?

117
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,861
No, I haven't been able
to get ahold of Taejoong.

118
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,115
You didn't tell him to leave, did you?

119
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,243
No. He could have left
for his own reasons.

120
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,871
But all of his things are still here.
So why would he...

121
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,664
Did you increase the rent?

122
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,084
Really? I'm not some kind of lowlife.

123
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,210
Right. Sorry.

124
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,504
I hope everything's okay with him.

125
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,882
What if he was caught by the police?

126
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,425
Was he thrown back in prison?

127
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,802
Why don't we go check?

128
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,886
Check?

129
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,680
What do you mean?

130
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,733
Can I...

131
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,280
-Have a good one.
-Thanks again.

132
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,406
-Hey.
-Is he there?

133
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,036
Judging by the answers I got from Father,
he hasn't been caught yet,

134
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,121
so that's good.

135
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,373
If he's not in here,
where the hell did he go?

136
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,546
I'll keep calling.

137
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,799
Wait a minute.

138
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,217
What?

139
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,137
Isn't he borrowing one of your phones?

140
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,561
-So you're looking for a lost phone?
-Yes.

141
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,687
Whose is it?

142
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,231
It's my phone.
But a thief ran off with it.

143
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,234
Did you let the authorities know?

144
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,153
Not yet. I thought it'd be a hassle.

145
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,946
Can you turn on location sharing?

146
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,322
Sure. ID, please.

147
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,407
Oh, sure.

148
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,910
Here.

149
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,418
-Would you write down the number for me?
-Okay.

150
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,339
Here.

151
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,425
What?

152
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,429
What was that?

153
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,064
So, does it show where he is?

154
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,483
Says he's in Busan right now.

155
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,651
Really?

156
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,821
TAEJOONG
BUSAN METROPOLITAN CITY

157
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,954
All right. Good work.
Verify the location, text it to me, okay?

158
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,459
Looks like I'm pretty good at my job.

159
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,461
What do you mean?

160
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,423
I decided to track Noh Yongsik's location,
and two phones showed up.

161
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,550
Both are in Busan.

162
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,011
I suspect Noh Yongsik has one of them.

163
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,348
But as for the second one,
it's probably with Park Taejoong.

164
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,974
This is too easy.

165
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,519
I mean, so is Noh Yongsik also a suspect?

166
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,692
Well, you know,
I can't leave any stones unturned.

167
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,910
Park Taejoong's whereabouts
have been found.

168
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,994
BUSAN TERMINAL AREA B

169
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,455
What happens
when I catch the real killer?

170
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,539
Park Taejoong?

171
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,416
I needed to prove my innocence.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,961
So I'm at the culprit's location now.

173
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,879
LOCKER NUMBER 102, PASSWORD 2802

174
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,369
Let's begin the prayer.

175
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,519
When you sleep,
does the past still haunt you?

176
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,480
Yeah, sometimes.

177
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,482
And the sudden shortness of breath...

178
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,900
Does that keep happening?

179
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,157
I'm not asking as your uncle-in-law,
but as a licensed psychiatrist.

180
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,533
I just want to help you.

181
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,161
Yes, sometimes.

182
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,082
Before it destroys you,
you have to let it go.

183
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,501
It's been ten years
since your parents passed,

184
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,420
and you can't keep blaming yourself.

185
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,964
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

186
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,215
Good.

187
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,629
It's time for the shares to be sorted.

188
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,798
I'm not sure we can
delay this much longer,

189
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,176
or else some might get the wrong idea
about who gets what.

190
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,511
Do as you please, Auntie.

191
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,556
The whole family's meeting for dinner.
Aren't you going?

192
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,059
Unfortunately, I can't. I have plans.

193
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,894
All right, I'll be in touch.

194
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,177
Did you wait in the car?

195
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,596
I made sure to stay out of sight,

196
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,890
since your relatives
hate seeing me around.

197
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,518
Did they try to console you
again this year?

198
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,436
It must be getting annoying.

199
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,231
It's expected. That's how they are.

200
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,485
The elders are like snakes in the grass,
watching me carefully

201
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,822
to see if the loss of my parents
is still affecting me,

202
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,448
especially that man...

203
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,118
Calling himself my uncle
and pretending to care about me.

204
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,744
Always ensuring I don't forget.

205
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,289
Anyways, let's go eat.

206
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,833
I'll tell them to prepare your meal.

207
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,918
Aren't you hungry?

208
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,712
I'm unable to join you today.

209
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,672
I apologize.

210
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,507
I hope you understand.

211
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,511
All right.

212
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,389
I was really hoping
I wouldn't be eating alone today.

213
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,233
All is ready.

214
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,074
Insert it deep in one breath.

215
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,410
You wretched bitch.

216
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,162
How dare you?

217
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,415
I should have thrown you out
while I could.

218
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,084
You had no power to begin with.

219
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,003
Young Master would have never allowed it.

220
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,506
Have you told him the truth about...

221
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,300
who his real mother is?

222
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,764
That the filthy blood of a lowly bitch
like you is running through his veins?

223
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,224
Does he know?

224
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,603
It's Master Yohan
who single-handedly built this company.

225
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,940
Someone who thinks they can take it
because of family-owned shares

226
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,234
is most likely the lowlier bitch, I think.

227
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:02,248
The only person our young master
could ever open his heart up to

228
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,457
was me.

229
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,753
He was alone and tormented by those
who called themselves his family.

230
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,048
Which explains why he hated
whenever I left him.

231
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:16,304
You might have fooled him,
but I know you've always exploited him

232
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,722
for your own personal gain.

233
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,229
So in order to make sure I stayed,

234
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:31,319
he crept in one night and poured mercury
into each of my eyes to make me blind.

235
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,365
I know that was his way
of expressing his love to me,

236
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,786
and I will always be
grateful to him for it.

237
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,481
Hey!

238
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Why don't you watch where you're going?

239
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,531
I didn't hit you, so back the fuck off!

240
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,283
-Oh shit, hey.
-Let me go!

241
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,451
Stupid ho!

242
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,161
-Hey!
-I'll fucking kill you.

243
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,287
Dokyung!

244
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,122
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

245
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,291
-Stop!
-Hold on. Wait. Come on, dude.

246
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,876
Wait.

247
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,378
Okay.

248
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,839
Hey, we're here to drink
and have a good time, remember?

249
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,174
All right.

250
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,467
Forget her. Let's go!

251
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,802
-Psycho!
-Come on!

252
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,720
She's crazy. Don't worry about her.

253
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,389
What the fuck are you looking at?

254
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,102
Hey, I hope you know
I went all out for tonight.

255
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,812
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

256
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,398
Hey, there's no friend like me, right?

257
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,571
Here.

258
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,698
Page 42.

259
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,624
Fuck yeah! Let's party!

260
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,889
Shit.

261
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,660
My friend mentioned
he saw a fucking weirdo stalking me.

262
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,788
Didn't realize it was you, delivery guy.

263
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,500
Good to finally meet you.

264
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,719
How's life?

265
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,430
What do you mean? Like, how have I been?

266
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,933
While I was rotting in prison for you...

267
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:50,976
what were you doing?

268
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,187
Oh...

269
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,691
You know, drinking and partying,
screwing bitches, surviving.

270
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,114
Chu Nayoung.

271
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,494
You remember her?

272
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,246
Chu Nayoung?

273
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,082
Oh... Oh, her.

274
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,295
Did you think I'd be crying every day
over that girl, full of regret,

275
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,965
tormented by guilt and unable to sleep?

276
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,508
That what you wanted?

277
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,802
You already did that for me.

278
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,015
And now I don't need you anymore.

279
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,913
Dokyung.

280
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,124
-Go wait inside for me.
-Sure.

281
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,122
You're done.

282
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,380
Yes, I'll be at the funeral hall tomorrow.

283
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,312
I picked this out for you.

284
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,690
You didn't have to do that.

285
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,026
I'm an adult now.

286
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,612
Taking care of you
is one of my few pleasures.

287
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,661
By the way, I heard there was an accident
with the elders and my aunt.

288
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,665
During the memorial dinner,
a massive fire broke out.

289
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,750
Really?

290
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,336
I guess these things happen, right?

291
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,629
BAEK DOKYUNG

292
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,509
You won't believe this.

293
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,053
I caught my avatar
and locked him in a room.

294
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,848
I was wondering who'd win.

295
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,267
I'm surprised.

296
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,353
There's something
I'm curious about, Mr. An.

297
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,690
How'd that bastard know
exactly where to find me?

298
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,653
Cough up the money you were paid
while I'm still asking nicely.

299
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,114
You did manage to catch him.

300
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,241
So I should give you a refund.

301
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,954
But send it to my account
instead of my father's.

302
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,415
And you don't care
if I kill the guy myself, do you?

303
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,458
Be my guest.

304
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,547
What a disappointing finale.

305
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,094
Oh, tell me, did anyone survive the fire?

306
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,972
The entire home was burnt to a crisp.

307
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,017
So it looks like there are no survivors.

308
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,020
That's the best news
I've heard in a while.

309
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,762
We're going shopping tomorrow, right?

310
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:55,929
I wanna go.

311
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,891
Have you...

312
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,435
ever killed a dog?

313
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,480
Like...

314
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,023
What?

315
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,649
A dog? You ever killed one?

316
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,360
Actually, over there...

317
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,071
There's a rabid dog inside.

318
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,239
He's disobedient. Stupid dog.

319
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,284
Let's put him out of its misery.

320
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,452
Yeah?

321
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,371
Yeah, come on. This'll be fun, all right?

322
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,248
Fuck, yeah! Let's kill this dog!

323
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,750
Get up! Come on.

324
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,876
Stop!

325
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,419
This isn't funny. Knock it off!

326
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,296
Just take me shopping instead.

327
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,591
Dumb bitch.

328
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,219
Pour me a glass.

329
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,429
-You have to mix it first.
-Any good?

330
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,306
Take this one.

331
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,767
-Let's do it.
-All right, let's hurry up and drink!

332
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,978
Throw it back. Chug, chug, chug!

333
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,189
Oh, yeah! Drink up!

334
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,358
Good shit, huh?

335
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,611
-I'm already starting to feel it.
-Yeah!

336
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,695
Holy shit!

337
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,905
Hell yeah!

338
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,407
-Hey, hold on, get off!
-Baby!

339
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,827
Mr. Shin. How many strokes
are you gonna shoot?

340
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,412
I'm gonna break a hundred!

341
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,039
I'm gonna have some more.

342
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,458
It's around here somewhere...

343
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,709
Is it this way?

344
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,462
Cops.

345
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,839
-Come on, hurry!
-Shit!

346
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,427
Gather round, everyone.

347
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:18,720
Whoa.

348
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,472
Head to the back of the building,

349
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,724
split up in teams of three
and surround them.

350
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,978
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, You guys are with me.

351
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,397
Oh, jeez.

352
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,066
-We have to find Taejoong fast.
-Yeah.

353
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,151
I'll go and check the boat
over there, okay?

354
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,862
-I'll look in here.
-Sounds good.

355
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,321
-Check everywhere.
-Okay.

356
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,489
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

357
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,023
Taejoong? Are you here?

358
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,068
Taejoong?

359
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,448
We need to discuss the next round
of investment.

360
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,367
Come on. I've been giving you
whatever you asked for.

361
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,202
I thought we were friends.

362
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,370
That's right.

363
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,372
So be a pal, okay?

364
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,916
What's that sound?

365
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,083
Cops are here?

366
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,546
Oh, shit. Hey, make sure
he doesn't do anything crazy.

367
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,055
All right. Get the fuck
out of my way, assholes!

368
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,556
Hey! Hey!

369
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,018
Step aside, before I lose it.

370
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,311
Move!

371
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,691
I'm sorry,
but there's a dress code to get in.

372
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,401
HWANG ILGUK
KOREAN POLICE

373
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,988
And what makes you think I give a shit?

374
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,114
Don't be rude, okay?

375
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,076
We're just looking for this guy.

376
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,703
Satisfied?

377
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,080
Appreciate your cooperation.

378
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,373
Hey.

379
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,875
I don't want to make a scene, detective.

380
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,253
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

381
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,507
I've heard of you,
but you don't know what I'm capable of.

382
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,217
Enough with the tough guy act.

383
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,596
I'll be quick.

384
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,306
Find that asshole now!

385
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,517
-Yes, sir.
-Follow me.

386
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,396
I'll start looking for them in here.

387
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,897
Oh, wait, wait.

388
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,317
You go check around the ships
at the dock, okay?

389
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,860
I'll handle this area.

390
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,409
He's so good at following orders.

391
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,708
You fucking gold-diggers.

392
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,128
Am I a fucking bank to you?

393
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,047
How dare you?

394
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,966
Stupid hoes.

395
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,677
You're all the fucking same.

396
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,183
Where are you?

397
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,769
I'm so bored of these bitches.

398
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,272
Let's kill that delivery guy.

399
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,566
Hold off on that.
The cops are here.

400
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,609
You serious?

401
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:25,198
All right, keep yourself
out of trouble. Stay put.

402
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,658
No, you're not the boss of me.

403
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,411
Hey! Listen to me.
Just stay there. Don't move.

404
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,997
Wait, wait, wait.

405
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,498
I told you he's not here.

406
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,792
-He might be in the other rooms.
-Out of my way!

407
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,086
He never came in here.

408
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,337
He might be over there.

409
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,256
-I need to confirm that.
-He's not here.

410
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,382
Come on. Trust me.

411
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,134
I think I saw him hiding there.

412
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,845
I swear, across the hall over there.

413
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,013
Yeah.

414
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,357
Off limits.

415
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,985
Didn't you hear me?

416
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,237
This area is restricted to everyone.

417
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,447
-Really?
-Including you.

418
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,006
Get the fuck out of my way!

419
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,635
Goddamn.

420
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,096
-Get a hold of yourself.
-My friend's in there.

421
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,764
No, she's not.

422
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,432
What's your problem?

423
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,922
Delivery guy?

424
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,983
Where is he?

425
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,069
Shit. Where did I put that fucker?

426
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,622
Fuck me.

427
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,457
Oh, shit.

428
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,043
Are you okay?

429
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,045
Yeah. Let's go.

430
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,422
-Stop right there.
-Huh?

431
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,674
Officer Yang.

432
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,177
Park Taejoong.

433
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,012
You have to leave. Go!

434
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,471
Noh Yongsik!

435
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,769
If you take one more step,
I'll have to take you back to prison.

436
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,314
Whether I'm free or locked up,
it makes no difference.

437
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,398
Don't lie to me.

438
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,110
Do you really want
to abandon your daughter again?

439
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,653
Don't bring her into this.

440
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,906
Park Taejoong.

441
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,575
I get it. Believe me, I do.

442
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,411
But you can't do it this way.

443
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,705
Let me help you.

444
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,916
-We'll go through all of--
-Officer Yang.

445
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,752
If you truly want to help him,

446
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,255
the best thing for you to do right now
is to let us go.

447
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,053
Come on.

448
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,512
We have to go.

449
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,100
Hey!

450
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,144
Holy shit!

451
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,189
Whoo! Look who it is!

452
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,482
Everybody's here!

453
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,735
Park Taejoong! I've finally found you.

454
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,785
What are you standing around for? Come on.

455
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,245
Detective.

456
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,580
We need to get out of here. Run!

457
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,082
Detective Hwang!

458
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,252
-Eunbi.
-Where do you think you're going?

459
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,087
Hey, I'll do it! Stay back!

460
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,269
You fucking bitch!

461
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,023
Where the fuck is that
delivery cocksucker?

462
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,276
Useless fucks!

463
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,321
Goddamn it.

464
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,324
How could you let
that delivery fucker get away?

465
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,617
Fuck!

466
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,745
Where the fuck is he?

467
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,139
-Hey!
-Hey.

468
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,141
Did you miss me?

469
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,227
Of course I did.

470
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,397
So what brings you all the way here?

471
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,898
Are you okay?

472
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,151
I'm sorry for crashing
your place like this.

473
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,986
-Hello.
-Hi.

474
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,197
Is that your dad?

475
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,075
Don't worry. I'll explain later.
You can head inside.

476
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,369
Once Taejoong gets here,
we'll follow you in.

477
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,662
There he is.

478
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,373
Okay. Whatever you say.

479
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,958
-Door's unlocked.
-Yeah.

480
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,126
He's here.

481
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,675
You okay?

482
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,013
Let's go inside.

483
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,438
You've got to be kidding me.

484
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,440
Eunbi, can you take him inside?

485
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,484
-Sure.
-I'll take care of this.

486
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,693
Come on.

487
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,573
Just what I needed.

488
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,390
Can I play with this one, too?

489
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,476
Sure. You can play with that one.

490
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,521
I'm letting you play with it
because you ate all your food.

491
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,705
Go. Get out.

492
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,311
Chu Nayoung.

493
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,940
You remember her?

494
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,192
Chu Nayoung?

495
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,237
Oh... Oh, her.

496
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:25,452
Did you think I'd be crying every day
over that girl, full of regret,

497
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,455
tormented by guilt and unable to sleep?

498
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,498
That what you wanted?

499
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,167
You already did that for me.

500
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,592
BUSAN BUS TERMINAL

501
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,797
Hmm. You're up already?

502
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,427
I owe you.

503
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,640
-Gimme some money and we'll call it even.
-I mean it.

504
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,308
I can't thank you enough.

505
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,061
Yeah.

506
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,646
Sure, whatever.

507
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,025
I'm going to the mechanic
to pick up the old man.

508
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,860
You can chill here.

509
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,160
Make yourself at home, okay?

510
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,621
Sure. Thanks.

511
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,123
Hey, stop being so weird.

512
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,008
-Wait. Hold on.
-Yeah.

513
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,718
-What?
-Explain yourself.

514
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,345
Who on earth is that guy?

515
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,513
He's nobody.

516
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,850
Ah, shit.

517
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,894
-Are you two dating?
-No, it's not like that.

518
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,479
Then what is it like?

519
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,776
Well, actually, he's an escapee.

520
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,152
An escapee?

521
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,737
So where did he escape from?

522
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:25,905
Your heart?

523
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,074
-Ah, shit.
-Uh-uh-uh...

524
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,660
Ex-boyfriend?

525
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,206
Ever since he got out,
he's been acting really fucking weird.

526
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,459
-I think he needs help.
-Why are you avoiding all my questions?

527
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,544
Give me the key.

528
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,838
Fine. Here you go.

529
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:44,966
He's a strange guy.

530
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,844
I think he might be lonely.

531
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,095
He should find someone.

532
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,055
You're so annoying.

533
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,534
-Wow, it smells good.
-Here you go.

534
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,660
Thanks.

535
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,787
Can I get another?

536
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,832
-Hotteok is my daughter's favorite.
-You got it.

537
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,881
-I appreciate it.
-Sure. Enjoy.

538
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,351
You didn't need to come
all the way out here.

539
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,228
What were you thinking,
driving a broken car?

540
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,440
What if you got into an accident?

541
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,781
Um, I got this for you, if you want it.

542
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,245
I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable again.

543
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,211
I mean, you already got it, so...

544
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,593
They said the car
will be fixed by tomorrow.

545
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,430
How's Taejoong doing?

546
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,266
He's fine, okay?

547
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,272
So he's a pretty good guy
once you get to know him, don't you think?

548
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,402
Yeah. He actually seems like a decent man.

549
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,364
All right. Come on, let's head back.

550
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,991
I'll drive so you can eat that.

551
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,875
Who the fuck are these stupid idiots,
anyway? Huh?

552
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,006
My guys are looking for them now,
so be patient.

553
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,758
You should go out there
and find them yourself, asshole!

554
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,348
Sure.

555
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,516
Okay.

556
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,561
Hey, let's grab something to eat.

557
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,062
Yeah, I'm starving.

558
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,442
I'm sick of this shit.

559
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,530
Wait a minute.

560
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,033
Where's my phone?

561
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,544
-Yes.
-Hey, it's me.

562
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,672
I hate that I have to ask you this.

563
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,674
It was you, right?

564
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,429
I'm not sure what you mean.

565
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,640
Did you sneak him out because
you didn't want to give me a refund?

566
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,060
You wouldn't do that, would you?

567
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,521
Stooping that low isn't quite your style.

568
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,482
Ah.

569
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,068
So it hasn't been decided
whose prize it is.

570
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,486
What prize?

571
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,489
What the fuck are you talking about?

572
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,577
What a smug little shithead.

573
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,746
Looks like he's got friends.

574
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,584
Well played, Park Taejoong.

575
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,047
So you're telling me
this is the guy you took the fall for?

576
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,134
What a terrible person.

577
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,515
Did you find any proof there?

578
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,559
All I did was ask him questions.

579
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,020
Like, "How's life?"

580
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,190
And what was the point in asking him that?

581
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,691
Bet his answer was bullshit.

582
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,528
You know what?

583
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,739
I think I...

584
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,618
I just want him to apologize.

585
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,417
Yeah.

586
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,128
He needs to say sorry.

587
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,421
He owes you that much.

588
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,674
You'll get an apology.

589
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,717
I promise you.

590
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,095
We'll make sure he apologizes.

591
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,973
I'll help you with everything.

592
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,141
Don't worry, okay?

593
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,398
It's all right.

594
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,807
So that guy's an escaped convict?

595
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,394
We'll need to discuss
how much extra this will cost.

596
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,522
All you think about is money, don't you?

597
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,940
Greedy bitch.

598
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,247
Give him a good show.

599
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,126

00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,376
Rounding. 9:00 p.m. tee off.

602
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,670
Don't be late.

603
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,719
I'll be waiting, delivery guy.
