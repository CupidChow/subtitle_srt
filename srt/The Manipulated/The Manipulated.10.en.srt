1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,957
The Manipulated

2
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,883
Excuse me.

3
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,094
Are you Baek Dokyung's mother?

4
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,638
Yes.

5
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,182
Hello. My name is An Yohan.

6
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,642
I'm a friend of your son's.

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,893
Oh, one of his friends?

8
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,228
Well, nice to meet you.

9
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,563
The thing is, my son isn't here right now.

10
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,483
Ah. I just wanted to say hi.

11
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,694
I have a business meeting
at this restaurant.

12
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,737
Oh, yes, I see.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,448
Your companions haven't arrived?

14
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,616
Just my husband.

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,035
We always come here
for our wedding anniversary.

16
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,538
He's a politician, so he's quite busy.

17
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,457
But moments like this
are still quite special to him.

18
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,960
Hmm. That's important.

19
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,171
Your son and your husband
came to visit my place recently.

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,883
And what is it that you do?

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,851
I operate a security consulting firm.

22
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,442
Well, I'm happy to know that my son
has such a wonderful friend.

23
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,069
I've only seen you in photos,
and I must say,

24
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,238
you're even more stunning in person.

25
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,032
Oh!

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,870
You're being polite.
Still, it's nice to hear.

27
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,714
-Why are you here?
-There you are.

28
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,634
I was keeping her company
till you arrived.

29
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,011
I actually need
to use the restroom.

30
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,972
I'll just be a minute.
Would you keep my husband company?

31
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,313
How did you know that I would be here?

32
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,733
Ah, don't you worry about that.

33
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,403
Besides, all I'm doing
is returning the favor.

34
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,657
I can track you down too, Congressman,
no matter where you are.

35
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,950
I'd say that makes us even.

36
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,119
How about you tell me
what you're doing here?

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,289
Should I?

38
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,503
Park Taejoong, that guy who escaped
from prison not too long ago?

39
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,296
He's after your son as we speak.

40
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,006
What?

41
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,217
That said, if you were to ask for my help,

42
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,512
I'd be willing to provide you
a security detail again.

43
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,889
Would you like my help?

44
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,989
You've allowed yourself
to become quite deluded.

45
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,783
I have?

46
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,243
You think I gave you that job

47
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,662
because I couldn't take care
of that guy on my own?

48
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,623
No, I did it because
everyone's good for something.

49
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,376
You clean up shit for me
after I've finished with it.

50
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,420
That's all that you're good for.

51
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,721
Wow, you're really something.

52
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,767
It just dawned on me
that you care more about your own pride

53
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,186
than you do your son's personal safety.

54
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,025
And now that you know,
I would proceed more carefully.

55
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,528
If you try to fuck me over,
you'll regret it.

56
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,908
Please excuse me.

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,954
I'm thinking this restaurant
just isn't for me.

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,292
Your insight is impressive
as always, Congressman.

59
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,795
Did he try to talk politics with you
while I was gone?

60
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,465
Not at all.
He gave me some valuable advice.

61
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,093
I would appreciate
if you reviewed my proposal.

62
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,845
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

63
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,973
Of course. I'll consider it
and get in touch with you soon.

64
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,154
What was that?

65
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,406
Uh, no, it was nothing.

66
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,367
He was asking me for a favor, that's all.

67
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,869
Then you should do it.

68
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,954
He says he's a friend of our son's.

69
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,999
You're right.

70
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,585
Why don't I just go ahead
and make that call right now?

71
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,753
Yeah, why not?

72
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,975
Congressman Baek...

73
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,685
This is his way of answering.

74
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,200
You shouldn't come to someone's house
without an appointment.

75
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,028
Where are you going, huh?

76
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,989
Where? Where you going?

77
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,347
The Manipulated

78
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,106
Want me to get you another beer?

79
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,399
No, no, I'm good.

80
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,651
This is enough for me.

81
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,157
You know, when I was younger,

82
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,951
I couldn't go a single day
without alcohol.

83
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,414
Every day I would come home
a complete mess.

84
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,832
Really? You?

85
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,793
I never would have guessed.

86
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,380
The day Eunbi's mother died...

87
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,259
I returned home drunk, as always...

88
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,806
and my wife started nagging me.

89
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,517
We had a fight, so I walked to the store.

90
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,436
But when I finally came back,

91
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,898
our whole house was on fire.

92
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,193
When I left in a rage,

93
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,071
I had thrown the cigarette I was smoking
down on the floor.

94
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,032
The embers must have caught on something.

95
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,034
My wife...

96
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,704
I should have gone in there
and gotten her out.

97
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,873
But I was so scared, I couldn't move.

98
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:23,670
The police saw me there and assumed
that I started the fire on purpose.

99
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,174
They said a good husband
would have gone in to save his wife.

100
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,096
Whenever I think about that night...

101
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,392
God...

102
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,355
I should have helped her,
but I did nothing but hesitate.

103
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,734
And so that's how my wife died.

104
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,486
I killed her.

105
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,405
Yongsik...

106
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,408
for as long as I've known you...

107
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,872
you have never hesitated, not once.

108
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,684
I know. I'm sorry.

109
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,730
We're gonna catch this guy
sooner or later.

110
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,232
I know you're working hard.

111
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,234
Just keep it up.

112
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,199
Well, that guy is impossible to read.

113
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,952
Can't tell if he's content
or if he really doesn't care.

114
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,252
I can't believe we came to Busan
and got bread instead of fish.

115
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,796
Ready to go?

116
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,963
Yeah.

117
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,778
You've been cooped up in here for hours.

118
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,238
What's keeping you so busy?

119
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,282
Park Taejoong's two little friends.

120
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,660
I have no idea why they're helping him.

121
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,121
What's the nature of their connection?

122
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,373
Maybe he paid them a lot of money.

123
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,667
Please. He doesn't have any money.

124
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,418
Huh.

125
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,920
Do you think they're family?

126
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,964
No, they're not related.

127
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,509
It's a guy he knew from prison
and the man's daughter.

128
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,346
-Hmm.
-These two lived separately for 20 years

129
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,140
and only reunited recently.

130
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,642
Actually, her father killed her mother.

131
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,937
Wow. That's pretty unusual.

132
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,900
But they don't seem
to get along with each other.

133
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,945
So why in the world are they
banding together for Park Taejoong?

134
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,865
I'm honestly pretty confused.

135
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,369
Oh, dear. I know how frustrated you get
when you can't solve your puzzles.

136
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,621
Should I stop by and ask them?

137
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,615
Wow.

138
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,576
Uh...

139
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,578
It's... It's time for breakfast.

140
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,416
That's all right.
I don't feel like eating right now.

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,503
Somebody spent time making it.
At least come and try it.

142
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,383
Something wrong?

143
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,511
Just come before the soup gets cold.

144
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,557
"Before the soup gets cold?"
What was that?

145
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,062
Why are you here?

146
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,605
I'm offering him food.

147
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,065
But I told you I'd do it.

148
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,150
What does it matter who tells him?

149
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,903
-You've got a crush!
-No way!

150
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,114
Didn't you tell me when you're around him,
it makes your heart ache?

151
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,282
Forget about that.

152
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,744
I'm gonna buy cigarettes.
Text me if you need anything.

153
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,747
-Wait, Eunbi, Eunbi!
-What?

154
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,458
Hurry back before the soup gets cold.

155
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,834
Hey, come here.

156
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:32,961
Come here. Hey!

157
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,004
You better come quick
or I'm gonna tell him.

158
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,616
That's right. We picked up a signal
from a nearby cell tower earlier.

159
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,202
When's backup going to arrive?

160
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,663
Damn it.

161
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,582
It's fine, you guys stay in position
until they get here.

162
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,709
I'm hanging up.

163
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,504
Welcome.

164
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,880
Oh, hello there.

165
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,479
-What are you doing?
-Miss, don't forget to take your items.

166
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,315
Huh?

167
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,276
Why isn't she taking
the stuff she paid for?

168
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,573
-Is this hers?
-Yes.

169
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,286
Excuse me.

170
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,915
Have you ever seen this person?

171
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,336
No.

172
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,756
Hang on.

173
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,551
Your cigarettes.

174
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,852
What's wrong with her?

175
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,729
What about you?

176
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,439
Oh, I already ate. You go ahead.

177
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,523
All right.

178
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,069
I can't promise it'll be any good.

179
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,278
No, it's really tasty.

180
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,823
Wow. When did you learn
how to cook like this?

181
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,410
-You must have been hungry.
-Mmm.

182
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,996
-There's more rice, so eat all you want.
-Sure.

183
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,915
It's good. Mmm.

184
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,999
MY DAUGHTER

185
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,417
Have some more.

186
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,629
Pick up the phone.

187
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,555
Why did you buy so many drinks?

188
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,560
The girl's cigarette money.

189
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,270
What?

190
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,485
Hey, get your hands off me! Oh!

191
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,697
Shit.

192
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,326
That's the girl we talked to at the shop!

193
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,744
-Damn it!
-Huh?

194
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,996
-Where are our guys?
-What is it?

195
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,625
Track the bicycle that just left the store
and follow us. Get in the car.

196
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,341
Ah, why isn't he answering?

197
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,013
That bicycle. Isn't that the one?

198
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,434
Oh, shit!

199
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,395
Jesus Christ. This is crazy.

200
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,720
That little shit.

201
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,848
Hey! Stop right there! Hey! Move the car!

202
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,851
Shit! I said move the car!

203
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,730
Wow! She got back here fast.

204
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,690
She must really like that guy.

205
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,735
-Whoa, what is it?
-Ah, shit!

206
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,737
What's the matter?

207
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,905
Be careful.

208
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,909
Why didn't you pick up?

209
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,577
The police are here.

210
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,206
Shit.

211
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,878
That little bitch.

212
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,926
All right, playtime's over.

213
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,263
What?

214
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,973
Hey! They're driving away!

215
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,225
Stop that car!

216
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,560
You search the house. Move it!

217
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,048
I got you now.

218
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,217
Check the trunk.

219
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,555
Get out!

220
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,807
Get out!

221
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,891
Come here.

222
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,727
-Is there anyone in the back?
-No. All clear.

223
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,274
Is refilling washer fluid a crime or what?

224
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,608
Noh Yongsik, you son of a--

225
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,069
Hey, mister!
Give me a bottle of washer fluid.

226
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,280
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

227
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,657
I've got a question for you
and I want an answer.

228
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,908
Where's Park Taejoong?

229
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,412
I'm a little confused as to why
you're looking for Park Taejoong here.

230
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,163
I know you know where he is.

231
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,249
Tell me now. I want an answer.

232
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,711
If you're so well informed,
can't you find him on your own?

233
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,254
I know nothing about it.

234
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,052
If you really didn't know,
then why'd you run away, huh?

235
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,096
Listen, I told you last time.

236
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,098
I don't like running into you.

237
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,474
It makes me uncomfortable.

238
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,019
And now you're chasing after us
like we're criminals?

239
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,729
What are you trying to accomplish?

240
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,439
Hurry up and let's go.

241
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,108
You little--

242
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,194
Shit.

243
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,325
Jesus.

244
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,579
Did you search the whole house?
You sure? Check the alley.

245
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,419
Been seeing you a lot lately.

246
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,671
Noh Yongsik, would you just...

247
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,590
please be honest with me?

248
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,759
Is Park Taejoong with you guys or not?

249
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,012
Which Park Taejoong do you mean,
the one who ran away

250
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,389
after committing a horrific murder,

251
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,183
or the one who was falsely accused

252
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,560
and is now desperately
trying to clear his name?

253
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,937
If it's Park Taejoong the murderer,
I won't say.

254
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,650
Washer fluid's in.

255
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,986
Let's go.

256
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,071
Right.

257
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,202
What's the situation over there?

258
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,579
Can't you do anything?
Wait, where are they going?

259
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,624
No one in the house?
Then check again, damn it! Shit!

260
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,809
Why aren't you answering?
Just pick up the phone!

261
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,193
Ah, who is it?

262
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,281
Who is it?

263
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,620
Uh...

264
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,705
Who are you?

265
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,015
Hello?

266
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,393
Can I help you?

267
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,397
Did you come to see Hanbyeol?

268
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,190
Hanbyeol?

269
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,067
Oh, you mean her?

270
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,361
Hanbyeol!

271
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,196
Oh, my God!

272
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,073
-Are you all right?
-What's wrong?

273
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,491
Come on, get up!

274
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,452
I'll take her inside. Let's go.

275
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,539
I'll take her to her room.

276
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,332
Hey. Try to wake up. Come on.

277
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,878
Who are you?

278
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,255
And what are you doing here?

279
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,050
I came to see you two, but she lied
and said she didn't know where you were.

280
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,178
You bastard!

281
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,722
You don't have to worry.
She just fainted. That's all.

282
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,891
But thanks to you, Park Taejoong

283
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,310
has weaseled his way
out of yet another crisis.

284
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,228
-I'm gonna--
-Eunbi, wait.

285
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,939
Just tell us. What do you want with us?

286
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,152
What is Park Taejoong paying you two?
It's just...

287
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,696
Harboring a fugitive carries
serious consequences.

288
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,116
So that tells me that whatever you
received must have been considerable.

289
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,785
Otherwise, why do all of this?

290
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,245
I have no idea
what you're even talking about.

291
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,206
You think we were paid to do something?

292
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,083
There has to be something.

293
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,794
I asked you, who the hell are you?

294
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,797
Take it easy. You take care of Hanbyeol.
I'll talk to him.

295
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,883
Yeah, but he's asking all these
strange questions about payment.

296
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,052
Hey, tell us who you are!

297
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,678
You're Noh Eunbi, aren't you?

298
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,308
Honestly, I'm also curious
about this father-daughter thing.

299
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,896
You get back together after 20 years
and you're the best of friends?

300
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,940
You know this man
killed your mother, right?

301
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,484
-What?
-Who the fuck do you think you are?

302
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,112
Eunbi!

303
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,366
Eunbi, are you all right?

304
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,492
Look at you.

305
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,703
You've got quite a temper
and you know how to punch.

306
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,372
Don't tell me you're holding back.

307
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,374
You protecting your dad now?

308
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,794
You should have fought back
if you wanted to protect your mother.

309
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,796
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch!

310
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,005
Eunbi!

311
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,593
You bastard! Come here!

312
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm going to ask you again.

313
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,692
What did you get from Park Taejoong?

314
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,694
Just answer the question.

315
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,070
Is that so hard?

316
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,155
You son of a bitch.

317
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,331
Well, this is no fun.

318
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,337
Since you two won't help me out, I guess
we'll just wait and see what happens.

319
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,340
Stop right there.

320
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,011
I said stop, you're not leaving, asshole!

321
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,180
Right.

322
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,434
I'm still uncertain
who's going to be the victor here.

323
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,309
Okay.

324
00:23:58,938 --> 00:23:59,939
Oh!

325
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,901
Move your foot out of the way. Come on.

326
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,457
Shit. I was really worried
you weren't gonna show up tonight!

327
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,545
Whoa! Did you see his eyes?

328
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,467
Hey, I get it, man.

329
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,386
You feel like you got fucked over.

330
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,515
I'm giving you a chance.

331
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,475
It's time to pay for all your crimes.

332
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,769
You're crazy, man.

333
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,688
What did I do?

334
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,815
Mr. An planned that whole thing.

335
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,567
I wasn't responsible for that.

336
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,110
You know the Arleli thing?

337
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,112
Is that it? Yeah, Arleli.

338
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,865
The sculptures or whatever.

339
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,119
Look, I got fucked over too.

340
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,912
So I'm willing to let this one go.

341
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,213
Ah, forget it.

342
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,676
If you were to drop dead right now,
my life would be so much simpler.

343
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,055
Actually, I think this is my chance.

344
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,600
You're wrong.

345
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,481
It's my chance.

346
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,940
Whoa, shit! What the...

347
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,906
-Is that a gun?
-This guy's crazy!

348
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,660
Oh, fuck!

349
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,378
Fuck!

350
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,715
Hey, call more of your guys!
I'll fucking pay you! Huh?

351
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,925
Go wait in the car.

352
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,469
All your whining is getting on my nerves.

353
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,970
Just get the fuck out of here.

354
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,305
Okay.

355
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,817
Fuck!

356
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,737
Fuck you!

357
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,721
Does it hurt? Huh?

358
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,269
Oh, shit.

359
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,868
So you brought a nail gun?

360
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,954
What are you, a carpenter or something?

361
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,212
Hey, come here.

362
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,300
Ah, Jesus Christ.

363
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,177
Come here.

364
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,226
Ahh!

365
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,145
Wait, wait, wait.

366
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,704
Do it. Shoot.

367
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,456
Do it!

368
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,169
Son of a...

369
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,214
Hey, he's there.

370
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,299
He went that way!

371
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,301
Hurry and get him!

372
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,851
-Oh, shit.
-Hey, boss, are you all right?

373
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,519
Get your fucking hands off!

374
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,194
Ah, damn it!

375
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,528
What the hell's going on?

376
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,742
That motherfucker!
All he does is take my fucking money.

377
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,298
Shit.

378
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,598
Shit.

379
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,336
Let's go.

380
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,296
Step on it!

381
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,095
Fuck! This crazy son of a bitch!

382
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,395
Get closer. I said get closer!

383
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,454
Closer! Closer!

384
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,622
Go, go, go, go!

385
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,923
Shit.

386
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,513
Get out of the fucking way! Damn it!

387
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,604
Fuck you! You're fucking--

388
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,907
Shoot him!
You better fucking shoot him right now.

389
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,650
Shit.

390
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,948
Die, you fucking asshole!

391
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,117
Fucking die!

392
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,568
Step on it!

393
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,320
What the fuck is wrong with you?

394
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,290
Oh, shit!

395
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,167
Hold him down!

396
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,378
Give me your gun. Where's your gun?

397
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,964
Gun, gun! Give me the gun.

398
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,970
Shit!

399
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,351
Son of a bitch.

400
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,653
Fuck.

401
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,838
You fucking morons!

402
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,787
Fuck you, you son of a bitch!

403
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,669
Jesus. Fuck.

404
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,776
VOICE RECORDING

405
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,569
Confess.

406
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,988
I want to hear it from you.

407
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,492
I don't think so.

408
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,286
Why don't you just fucking kill me?

409
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,690
INCOMING CALL
CEO AN

410
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,526
What did I do?
Mr. An planned that whole thing.

411
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,236
I wasn't responsible for that.

412
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,670
I'm glad you managed
to find my little gift. Good for you.

413
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,505
I had faith you'd be able to do it.

414
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,383
2802, Mr. Vitamin.

415
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,761
-What exactly do you need?
-Vitamins.

416
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,137
Vitamins?

417
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,896
It was you?

418
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,614
In all honesty, I was hoping
you'd be the winner.

419
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,284
Is Baek Dokyung dead?

420
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,121
It looks like it.

421
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,626
How does it feel to finally take revenge?

422
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,463
I knew you had it in you,
But still, this was quite shocking.

423
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:22,091
Oh, dear. What a terrible accident.

424
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,344
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

425
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,694
You've been through a lot.

426
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,446
Why don't you tell me what you want?

427
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,406
How about five billion?

428
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,534
That was the prize money back then.

429
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:50,370
That's more than you could
ever make on your own.

430
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,581
And what do you want in return?

431
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,210
Ah...

432
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,670
Well, let's see.

433
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,339
What use do I have for you? Ah.

434
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,299
How about you work as my partner?

435
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,178
I have a feeling that you and I
would work quite well together.

436
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,265
With that kind of money,
you could do whatever you want.

437
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,393
I'd also restore your identity
and clear your name.

438
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,562
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

439
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,356
Bear in mind,
the only reason I'm making you this offer

440
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,066
is because I genuinely like you.

441
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,698
Restore everything?

442
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,453
Why don't you turn back time instead?

443
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,874
My life was destroyed because of you.

444
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,042
You took my friends away...

445
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,545
...and you got my brother killed.

446
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,172
Can you restore all of that?

447
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,597
What's the point of bringing up old news?
I'm trying to make a deal with you.

448
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,933
Your brother died because
you lost the bracelet. Simple as that.

449
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,436
Besides, I killed the guy
who killed your brother.

450
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,272
Your revenge should've ended after that.

451
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,733
But no, you keep blaming other people.

452
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,943
It's quite pathetic if you think about it.

453
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,487
What I want right now...

454
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,662
is to drag you down from there
and make you pay for what you've done.

455
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,045
Look, I think that I've made you
a pretty generous offer.

456
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,588
Don't waste it.

457
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,506
Just you wait.

458
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,592
I'll be coming for you next.

459
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,511
All right.

460
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,890
We'll do things your way from now on.

461
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,268
And the next time we meet,
we'll exchange more than just words.

462
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,658
He's completely consumed with revenge.

463
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,129
I don't usually make these visits myself.

464
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,677
I mean, what's the point?

465
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,599
All that driving back and forth
is such a waste of time.

466
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,858
But you're an exception, Assemblyman.

467
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,237
Do you want to know a secret?

468
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,993
When I was 16 years old,
both of my parents died.

469
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,958
What I mean to say is...

470
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,711
I killed the both of them.

471
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,049
They had signed this pledge
and said they would donate

472
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,134
all of their assets to our local temple.

473
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,470
And when I found out,

474
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,307
I felt this rage
that I just couldn't control.

475
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,102
When I saw the autopsy results later,

476
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,814
it said they'd been stabbed
130 times in total.

477
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,899
Crazy, right?

478
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,859
I'm not sure what compelled me.

479
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,778
But either way,

480
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,781
when I saw them lying in the kitchen,

481
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:56,866
I remember thinking,

482
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,702
"How am I gonna deal with this?"

483
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:00,870
Wouldn't you have it?

484
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,831
A news report came on saying a murderer

485
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,542
had broken out of prison
and was hiding nearby.

486
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,922
So I filed a report and said
this murderer killed my parents.

487
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:15,593
Two days later, that guy was shot
and killed trying to flee the police.

488
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,639
That's when I realized...

489
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,891
Oh...

490
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,644
I could use
this method in the future.

491
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,105
It was too easy.

492
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,940
I've never told anyone this before.

493
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,944
That means, Assemblyman Baek,

494
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,863
you have to take this to your grave.

495
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,204
Congratulations.

496
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,456
Does this thing work?

497
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,084
The old man
still has some regrets.

498
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,940
So what are you going to do next,
Park Taejoong?

499
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,616
The Manipulated
