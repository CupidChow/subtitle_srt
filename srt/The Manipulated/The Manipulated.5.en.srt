1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,957
The Manipulated

2
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,669
5 YEARS AGO

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,754
No, that's not what happened.

4
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,508
She's the one who called me
asking to hang out.

5
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,592
So we did,

6
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,556
and I told her to go home
after we had a couple of drinks.

7
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,105
What?

8
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,273
I'm not fucked up.

9
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,357
No.

10
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,736
I... I haven't done any drugs.

11
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,698
Well...

12
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,077
...maybe a little.

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,583
The thing is...

14
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,923
this girl... um...

15
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,634
she's not breathing.

16
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,305
Ah, fuck.

17
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,643
Dad, what should I do?

18
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,980
I think I'm starting to freak out.

19
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,818
Fuck me.

20
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,202
-Where is this from?
-It's, uh, Spain.

21
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,455
They're usually pretty good.

22
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,207
-Here.
-Cheers to us.

23
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,045
Attention,
we will resume shortly.

24
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,630
-We would like to ask our guests...
-Let's go.

25
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,715
...to return to seats.

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,967
I heard an investment firm won this bid,

27
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,219
but isn't it reckless
to let a company like that

28
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,472
handle national data security?

29
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,767
Somehow they bypassed getting
their credentials verified.

30
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,185
I'm sure money played a part.

31
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,646
-Let's sit there.
-They weren't in the initial bid.

32
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,274
But they showed up in the final round
and snatched up the project.

33
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,401
There's something fishy about it.

34
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,695
Why make us come
all the way out to the boonies?

35
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,156
They think they can do
whatever they want with us.

36
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,450
Should we shake them up a little?

37
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,951
We should.

38
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,374
-Let's...
-Mind if I take a seat?

39
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,504
Allow me to shed some light, gentlemen.

40
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,715
That company has roots
in security solutions

41
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,551
and now manages data
for a major portal in Korea.

42
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,221
Now, what did you say earlier?

43
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,641
Hmm? You'd shake them up?

44
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,352
You underestimate their power.

45
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,314
Every last detail about the three of you
can be easily collected.

46
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,484
The only reason they haven't is,
you aren't worth the trouble.

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,195
-What do you mean?
-Their pockets are deep

48
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,949
and the C.E.O. has many interests.

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,785
And because of that, they became
an investment company

50
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,829
in order to manage various enterprises.

51
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,459
But their core business is data security,
and that was why they won in the end.

52
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,548
One of the conditions was that the bidder
had to construct the data center nearby,

53
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,550
but it was taken out in a revision.

54
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,761
That's highly unusual, don't you think?

55
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,389
Global companies build centers
in polar regions

56
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,808
for the purpose of improving
power efficiency.

57
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,269
But that seemed a bit too far away.

58
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,480
That's why we're building it here.

59
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,441
Anyone with a brain would know that.

60
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,696
Well, you must be a loyal employee.

61
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,616
Then how do you explain
the government's sudden policy change?

62
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,329
Well, they probably have a close friend
in high places.

63
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,583
Also, you got it wrong.
I'm not some employee.

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,461
I'm the owner of this entire company.

65
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,880
Without further ado,
I would like to introduce

66
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,382
the most important person of this event.

67
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,927
Please give a warm welcome
to the C.E.O. of GA Investments,

68
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,679
Mr. An Yohan.

69
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,268
The three of you are sitting at my feast,

70
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,229
hoping you'll catch any crumbs that fall.

71
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,565
But don't worry.

72
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,525
I'll leave scraps for you.

73
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,529
Here he is, Mr. An.

74
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,573
Let's give him a big round of applause.

75
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,617
Arrogant prick! Who does he think he is?

76
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,494
I'll teach this punk respect.

77
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,564
His finger might work.

78
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,382
Oh, what the hell is this?

79
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,844
Hey, move it!

80
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,765
How does an idiot like you
have a driver's license?

81
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,018
What kind of inconsiderate person
parks their car like this?

82
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,231
Hey, move your car, dumb ass!

83
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,783
How'd you know I was thirsty?

84
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,037
I can hear the excitement in your voice.

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,247
You must have finished
another masterpiece.

86
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,088
I wasn't sure if I'd
find the missing piece,

87
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,591
but here it is.

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,093
I think it's beautiful.

89
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,805
Renoir once said
that the pain passes,

90
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,307
but the beauty remains.

91
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,975
Wow.

92
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,108
ASSEMBLYMAN BAEK

93
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,570
But in this life, pain never ends.

94
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,616
Hello.

95
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,994
Think of it as a security detail.

96
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,955
Ordinarily, security involves someone

97
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,291
taking the hit for you
in exchange for money.

98
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,088
However, I do things a little differently.

99
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,841
I start protecting you
after an incident has happened.

100
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,844
And I don't charge money
for these services.

101
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,349
All I ask in return,
is that you buy me an art piece.

102
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,811
Now listen carefully.

103
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,231
Your son needs to put
the body in warm water.

104
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,110
Don't worry, Assemblyman Baek.
We'll handle everything.

105
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,945
Appreciate doing business with you.

106
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,271
All right, people, let's do this.

107
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,213
The thing is...

108
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,632
this girl...

109
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,468
um, she's not breathing.

110
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,975
Oh, shit!

111
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,852
Fuck!

112
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,479
His footsteps are everywhere.
I said to be careful.

113
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,773
Why aren't you answering!!!!
Where are you?!!!! 9 Missed Calls - Kongi

114
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,608
Well, your phone... turn off.

115
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,402
Fuck!

116
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,252
Shall we find some candidates?

117
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,212
Show nearby CCTV footage.

118
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,999
This guy keeps popping up near this home.

119
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,419
Bingo. Our culprit.

120
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,009
The order is ready.

121
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,802
Oh, thanks.

122
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,888
-Appreciate it. See ya.
-Sure.

123
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,390
All right.

124
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,751
He stays busy.

125
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,340
Jeongdok Exam Prep Academy

126
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,508
A younger brother.

127
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,807
Is he watering those?

128
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,518
He must have a soft spot for plants.

129
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,604
What a pure soul.

130
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,069
His girlfriend's pretty.

131
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,498
Let's start sculpting.

132
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,551
Thursday, August 20

133
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,482
Cleaning Service

134
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,513
Make sure to take this, too.

135
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,471
What crime should I sculpt for you?

136
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,203
The real-time CCTV is...

137
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,377
Come on, turn the lights off.

138
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,795
Do it.

139
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,634
Collect everything
that comes out of that house today.

140
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,437
General Waste Bag
10L

141
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,292
Bodily fluids presumed
to belong to the culprit

142
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,002
were found in the victim's body.

143
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,392
It's gone.

144
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,977
He must have lost it.

145
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,478
Check if we found a bracelet.

146
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,399
If we didn't, find an identical one
and place it at the scene.

147
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,777
Where's the bracelet?
The one I gave you.

148
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,280
Why don't you have the bracelet
I gave you?

149
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,656
My bracelet?

150
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,701
It fell off in Taejoong's room that night.

151
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,795
Excuse me, young man,
could you lend a hand?

152
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,349
Let's put a plant here,
maybe a China doll tree,

153
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,808
and make sure it's a sick one.

154
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,858
The China doll tree needs to be in
partial sunlight to keep its leaves

155
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,068
from drying out. So I moved it a bit.
I recommend adding pot fertilizer.

156
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,280
Time for the exhibition.

157
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,796
At the end of the day,
we're the ones on top,

158
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,965
the 1% chosen to run the world.

159
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,218
People like us must never falter.

160
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,139
We rely on the other 99%
to cheer us on and protect us

161
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,849
and forgive us for our mistakes.

162
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,686
That way we can continue to lead them.

163
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,438
Your son's name is Baek Dokyung, right?

164
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,442
We don't want him traumatized.
So send him on a vacation.

165
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,736
He'll forget in no time.

166
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,659
MAN IN HIS 30S SUSPECTED
OF DISMEMBERMENT MURDER

167
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,661
ARRESTED AT HOME
IN AN EMERGENCY ARREST

168
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,707
The Manipulated

169
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,987
Talk to me.

170
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,206
Feed them first.

171
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,504
What the... Where are we?

172
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,299
Where are we?

173
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,055
Can you hear me? Are you alive?

174
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,565
Get them out.

175
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,651
-Get off me!
-Move!

176
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,540
Okay.

177
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,402
What is this?

178
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,322
Shit.

179
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,576
No.

180
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,912
Oh, shit, man!

181
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:20,678
Since you dragged us all here blindfolded,
I doubt we came to do any legal work.

182
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,889
You shove us in a truck, and now
you think we're gonna act like dogs,

183
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,683
thanking you for treats? Fuck that.

184
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,727
Who gives a shit? I'm starving.

185
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,399
Aren't you guys hungry?

186
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,193
Is that lobster?

187
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,575
Eat up, you're going to need the energy.

188
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,164
-This way, boss.
-Okay.

189
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,334
Come this way.

190
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,904
That piece of shit warden.

191
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,697
What's he up to?

192
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,074
This is bullshit.

193
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,913
What the hell's gonna happen to me?

194
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,428
Shit.

195
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,185
Oh, shit.

196
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,900
Fuck.

197
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,479
Hazardous Gas Handling Facility

198
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,208
Out on a walk, 2802?

199
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,544
Come here.

200
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,840
It's okay. Come on.

201
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,059
It wasn't easy to bring you here,
so don't do this to me.

202
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,854
Get in.

203
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,274
Let's get you back to your room.

204
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,168
You were trying to escape, weren't you?

205
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,797
Don't worry, I'm not angry.

206
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,591
Actually, I kind of like that.

207
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,843
Desperation's good.

208
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,112
I see.

209
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,448
So you're the one who brought us all here?

210
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,867
I am.

211
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,995
-For what?
-Does that matter?

212
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,039
You're already here.

213
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,542
Just worry about what's happening next.

214
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,629
If you want to be rewarded,
you might want to focus a little.

215
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,299
There will be a match soon.

216
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,386
-A match?
-Mmm-hmm.

217
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,098
And so all I'm asking is for you
to do your best out there.

218
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,810
And if you come out on top,

219
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,145
you'll win a special prize.

220
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,897
Want to know what it is?

221
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,482
No, wait.

222
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,067
I don't want to spoil the fun.

223
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,655
You know, I feel like I know you.

224
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,408
Are you someone famous?

225
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,038
Well, I guess everyone in here is.

226
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,416
See you at the match.

227
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,539
Taejoong. I thought you broke out again.

228
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,541
So I've been worried sick about you.

229
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,251
What?

230
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,671
Isn't it awesome
how they gave us lobster, drinks,

231
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,506
new clothes, like we're not prisoners?

232
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,633
Hey.

233
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,304
Since when did we become friends?

234
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,309
Oh, well, after seeing you fight,
I've gained a lot of respect for you.

235
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,563
Without a doubt in my mind,
your side is the one I want to be on.

236
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,774
So ignore any crazy shit
I might do or say.

237
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,570
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-I have to do what I can to survive.

238
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,988
I have no other option.

239
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,157
-We need to go somewhere.
-Go to bed.

240
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,034
I'm begging you to come with me.

241
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,078
-Let go, man.
-It'll only take a second.

242
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,706
Remember, I'm on your side.

243
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,920
-Why are you bringing me here?
-Come on.

244
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,175
Boss, I brought him like you asked.

245
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,844
Hey!

246
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,056
Don't be rude and get your ass over here.

247
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,309
Hello.

248
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,062
Park Taejoong. Come say hi to the boss.

249
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,731
-This piece of...
-Disrespectful bitch.

250
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:38,360
Hey, hey, hey! Taejoong, wait.

251
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,821
Listen, I'm fucked
if you don't go over there.

252
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,740
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

253
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,160
Come on! Hurry up, asshole!

254
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,788
You're fucking crazy.

255
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,499
Look who it is.

256
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:06,722
With everything going on, I haven't
gotten the chance to thank you yet.

257
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,308
You know, for this generous gift.

258
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,227
So thanks, man.

259
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,940
Shit. It still hurts.

260
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,826
At least your ear's back in one piece.

261
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,786
It's like it's brand new.

262
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,374
This little bastard. Are you crazy?

263
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,253
You really want to fucking do this?

264
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,771
Looks like today is not the day.

265
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,649
But I'm sure there will be plenty
of chances to return the favor.

266
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,001
playing on P.A.]

267
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,803
Oh, shit.

268
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,224
continues playing]

269
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,061
Did everyone sleep well?

270
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:05,859
You must be wondering where you are
and why you've been brought to this place.

271
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,403
Well, your time begins now.

272
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,114
This is the land of opportunity.

273
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,750
What is this place, huh?

274
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,001
Isn't it obvious?

275
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,836
It's a racetrack.

276
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,840
Racetrack? Like, for cars?

277
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,300
Here?

278
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,429
Each of you will drive a randomly
assigned vehicle and race one another.

279
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,264
Besides that,

280
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,184
there are no rules.

281
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,895
Is this some kind of sick joke?

282
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,149
-Hey, man, calm down.
-Seriously, a fucking car race?

283
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,902
How are you allowed to do this shit to us?

284
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,198
Well, I got permission.

285
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,492
Man, this is completely insane bullshit!

286
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,287
You bring us here like cattle, feed us
and think we'll play your little games?

287
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,580
You're fucking delusional!

288
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,458
I'm going to sue
the living shit out of you!

289
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,752
Let's get the fuck out of here.

290
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,504
Hey.

291
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,704
Any other complaints?

292
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,544
Or does anybody else want to leave?

293
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,008
If not, then allow me to continue.

294
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,264
Watch out.

295
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,368
5 billion won.

296
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,289
That's the total prize money
for whoever wins first place.

297
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,755
Wow, this is crazy.

298
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,923
Sir, I have a question.

299
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,346
If we're gonna, um, do a car race,
how do we, like, get the cars?

300
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,765
That's all.

301
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:49,564
The number that's on your uniform matches
the garage you've been assigned to.

302
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,066
Your car will be inside.

303
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,028
And to prevent any mishaps
like we had earlier,

304
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,198
I'll give you chances to consult with me.

305
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,993
So if you end up having questions,
just come and find me.

306
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,754
Sounds like fun.

307
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,473
At ease!

308
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,893
Shit, are those real guns? Huh? Wow.

309
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,189
What the fuck?

310
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,858
Shit! I'm already excited.

311
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,738
They're real, right?

312
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,615
Wow.

313
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,201
Fuck, yeah!

314
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,333
What the fuck is this place?

315
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,254
Hey.

316
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,382
I heard your avatar choked on a Bible.

317
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,717
Yep, he did.

318
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,344
Count yourself lucky.

319
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:05,181
My fucking avatar managed to survive
for years, but finally died last week.

320
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,892
-Glad that shit's over.
-Hey, keep it down, will you?

321
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,477
What if someone hears you?

322
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,731
What are you so afraid of, huh?
Are you scared?

323
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,317
C.E.O. Yohan only invited us.

324
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,027
We don't have to be quiet.

325
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:22,282
What do you mean, "last week"? I thought
your avatar got wiped out months ago.

326
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,075
Right.

327
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,577
This was my third one.

328
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,332
Fucking psycho.

329
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,376
Where are you from?

330
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,006
Hey, hey, look.

331
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,095
Whoa.

332
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,431
This is impressive.

333
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,267
Wow!

334
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,187
The party has arrived.

335
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,814
It's good to see you.
Been a while.

336
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,232
Get in here.

337
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,403
I'll take one, thanks.

338
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,823
Holy fuck!

339
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,995
This view is insane.

340
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,249
Wow.
This is quite the setup you got here.

341
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,626
Sit wherever.

342
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,253
Thanks for making time to come by.

343
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,840
Thank you for inviting us
to make money in such a fun way.

344
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,219
Okay. Help me understand what this is.

345
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,762
Racecars.

346
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,599
So it's just a bunch of prisoners racing?

347
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,477
-What's so great about that?
-It's not some simple race.

348
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,898
Uh, think of it as more of a dogfight.

349
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,441
Dogfight?

350
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,778
Dogfight is like combat, so...

351
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,741
Shit, I just got goosebumps.
It all just clicked in my head.

352
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,244
Dogfighting with cars.

353
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,662
Won't there be casualties?

354
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,122
That's the whole fucking point.
Isn't that right?

355
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,544
I invited you here
so you could witness it for yourselves.

356
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,546
-Nice.
-Seeing it with your own eyes

357
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,965
will be the most fun you've had in years.

358
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,088
Nice! This car looks fast as fuck.

359
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,173
Hell, yeah.

360
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,647
All of the prisoners will receive
everything they need

361
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,691
to maintain and fix up their cars.

362
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,360
Is this a good car or a bad one?

363
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,529
A prisoner may not get a good car,

364
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,574
but that doesn't necessarily mean
they're at a disadvantage.

365
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,036
The only rule is that there are no rules.

366
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,787
Nothing is off limits.

367
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,415
The prisoners are allowed
to do anything to win.

368
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,084
-This way a little bit.
-Got it.

369
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,427
Holy shit, is this for real?

370
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,637
Oh!

371
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,743
So what's our role in all of this?

372
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,330
You will be the founding members
of this business.

373
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,585
With this race, we'll attract
the high rollers who love to gamble,

374
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,463
and set up
a betting system on the dark web.

375
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:10,134
Once we work out the kinks, we'll host
more races and expand to other countries.

376
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,346
Of course, there are prisoners
all over the world.

377
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,932
Hmm. You've put thought into this.

378
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,894
You said you'd give
prize money to the winner.

379
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,354
You actually gonna do that?

380
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,399
I promised I would,

381
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,360
-but...
-But?

382
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,780
...I doubt anyone will make it
to the finish line.

383
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,766
The Manipulated
