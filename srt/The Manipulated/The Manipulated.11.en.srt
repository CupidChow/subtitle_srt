1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,957
The Manipulated

2
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,086
What?

3
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,921
-Call it off?
-Yeah.

4
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,840
Well, Park Taejoong
hasn't been caught yet, so I'm sure--

5
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:49,925
Hello?

6
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,345
Yeah, I'll mobilize the team now.

7
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,846
Shit.

8
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,432
-It's been a blast, but we're done.
-Hang on a sec.

9
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,020
Why are they terminating this? Huh?

10
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,273
Guys like us
are only supposed to follow orders.

11
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,733
-What does it matter?
-That's not good enough for me.

12
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,235
You want to know that badly?

13
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,444
Yeah.

14
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,197
All right, then. Hop in.

15
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,955
Your car is ready, sir.

16
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,665
Thanks. Appreciate your help.

17
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,833
-Take care.
-Bye.

18
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,757
Taejoong and I agreed to meet up in Seoul.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,885
Maybe we should have gone there together.

20
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,597
Listen, I think
you should stay here and...

21
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,528
-Wait, what's going on?
-You're under arrest.

22
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,488
What are you doing? Wait!

23
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,074
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Stay still.

24
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,284
Stop moving!

25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,452
Wait! Let me go!

26
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,703
Move in! Come on.

27
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,121
You can't do this!

28
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,581
Enough!

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,499
This has to be illegal!

30
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,667
What a fucking brat.

31
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,128
Noh Yongsik.

32
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,757
You're under arrest as a suspect
in the recent murder of Assemblyman Baek.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,468
-All right, guys.
-But you're making a mistake!

34
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,595
I don't know what you're talking about!

35
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,556
You have the right to remain silent,
and to an attorney.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,726
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

37
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,603
He didn't do anything wrong!

38
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,772
Get the fuck off of me. Detective!

39
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,025
Papa! My dad is innocent!

40
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,153
Papa!

41
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,785
Let's go, let's go! Let's go!

42
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,995
-Get out of the way!
-Mr. Noh!

43
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,830
Mr. Noh! Do you have anything to say?

44
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,253
The suspect, Mr. Noh,
who murdered Assemblyman Baek Sangman,

45
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,090
has finally been caught
after a long pursuit.

46
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,343
He was recently released
after serving a 20-year sentence

47
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,761
for the murder of his wife.

48
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,640
Investigations revealed
that shortly after his release,

49
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,560
he began sending threatening letters
and demanding money from the assemblyman.

50
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,105
Furthermore, given that the perpetrator

51
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,982
killed a sitting member
of the National Assembly,

52
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,360
the police are focusing
their investigation

53
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,654
on whether there were any accomplices.

54
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,117
The Manipulated

55
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,870
That's all we need.

56
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,707
So why'd you do it?

57
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,795
I thought I was innocent
until proven guilty.

58
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,924
You're labeling me as a murderer
when I don't even know what's going on.

59
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,968
I swear you have the wrong person.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,220
But didn't you send letters
to the assemblyman

61
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,347
asking for money
and threatening to kill him?

62
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,599
That wasn't me sending all those letters.

63
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,519
I promise
I'm telling you the truth, Detective.

64
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,937
I'm sorry, ma'am.

65
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,689
I don't care, I have to get inside.

66
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,899
-Please calm down.
-Get out of my way!

67
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,944
He's being interrogated right now,
so we can't let you in.

68
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,030
What's the real reason I can't?

69
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,241
Don't you know I'm his daughter?

70
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,743
-What the fuck are you doing to him?
-Stay calm.

71
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,120
Move out of my way!

72
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,413
-Let me in there!
-Stop!

73
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,499
Ring any bells?

74
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,126
Seriously?

75
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,086
How many times do I have to tell you?

76
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,255
It's the first time
I've ever seen this place.

77
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,590
I don't know where this is.

78
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,426
So how would I be able
to send those letters there?

79
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,889
In the latest development
of the murder of Assemblyman Baek,

80
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,725
the papers used in the letters,
along with the victim's DNA,

81
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,477
were found in the suspect's home.

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,229
Due to these findings,
police are investigating this crime

83
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,522
as premeditated murder.

84
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,651
PROBABILITY OF BEING THE SAME INDIVIDUAL
99.9993%

85
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,947
So you're saying the victim's DNA
was found in my house?

86
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,032
Yes.

87
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,576
DNA MATCH REPORT

88
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,537
And also that my DNA was found
at the crime scene as well?

89
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,338
I can't believe they went into my house.

90
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,637
Eunbi.

91
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,264
I don't think I can help you.

92
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,641
What? You're leaving?

93
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,602
If you get appointed another lawyer,

94
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,939
maybe you should consider
that honesty is the best policy.

95
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,148
Wait. No.

96
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,818
Sir, my daughter is...

97
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,279
Eunbi is in danger.

98
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,364
What do I do?

99
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,658
-Time to go.
-Please, officers.

100
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,451
I've to get to my daughter right now.

101
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,995
-She's not safe at home by herself.
-Okay.

102
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,247
I have to protect her.

103
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,249
-Stay calm, sir.
-Don't you understand?

104
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,834
-Hey!
-I have to get to her!

105
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,126
Eunbi!

106
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,628
Hold him down.

107
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,964
Don't you understand
what kind of danger she's in?

108
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,974
Here.

109
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,895
Why are we moving so fast on this case?

110
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,940
It's open and shut,
so we might as well wrap it up quickly.

111
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,485
-Are you bringing in the daughter?
-Of course we are.

112
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,613
We found evidence that she received
a cut of the criminal proceeds.

113
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,781
They're in it together.

114
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,075
My daughter had nothing to do
with any of this!

115
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,619
-Oh. Scared me.
-If you dare lay even a finger on her,

116
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,497
I swear, I'll make all of you pay for it.
Got it?

117
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,499
-Shit.
-That's funny.

118
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,209
-You'll make me pay?
-Hey, come on.

119
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,294
Back off.

120
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,839
-Was that a threat?
-Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

121
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,467
Just leave my daughter out of this.
I'll do anything.

122
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,595
I'm begging you.

123
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,764
Then confess.
We already have all the evidence.

124
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,726
We're both innocent.

125
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,645
Forget it. We'll get our answers
after we interrogate her.

126
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,565
Hey! If you do anything to hurt her,

127
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,276
I'll kill every single one
of you assholes!

128
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,278
You fucking hear me?

129
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,821
Eunbi is innocent!

130
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,199
I need a smoke.

131
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,828
Hey. Hey!

132
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,293
Eunbi. Eunbi.

133
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,506
GET LOST MURDERER
GO TO HELL

134
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,844
Eunbi.

135
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,471
Eunbi!

136
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,182
Are you here?

137
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,154
Shit.

138
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,056
Bastard!

139
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,153
We truly got blindsided with all this.

140
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,363
This isn't your dad's fault.

141
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,033
You know that, right?

142
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,201
What does it matter?

143
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,996
No one will believe what we have to say.

144
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,748
They already decided he's guilty.

145
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,294
Everybody else might believe those lies.
But you... We know the truth.

146
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,588
What good is that?

147
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
Why is he taking the blame for all this?

148
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,010
Why be such an idiot?

149
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,429
Can't he fight back for once?

150
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,222
It's like he doesn't even try!

151
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,271
What am I supposed to do?

152
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,651
What if my dad goes back to prison?

153
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,653
I can't do this again.

154
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:38,078
Listen, this all happened
because of me, so...

155
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,162
I'll fix it.

156
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,750
I'll figure something out, okay?

157
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,255
What are you gonna do?

158
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,507
No, wait.

159
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,800
Where are you going?

160
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,427
You can't leave!

161
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,955
Congratulations, Young Master.

162
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,293
Your 100th sculpture.

163
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,296
And how do you know that?

164
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,050
Because I've been keeping track.

165
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,178
For this auction,
what about holding a special exhibition?

166
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,681
That would be the perfect chance
to reveal yourself.

167
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,765
And why should I?

168
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,561
Arleli's genius as an artist
deserves to be praised properly.

169
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,814
So, the world should know
his true identity.

170
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,025
The name of the greatest artist
to ever live.

171
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,113
An Yohan.

172
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,699
You're right.

173
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,118
It's time to step out of the shadows.

174
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:05,081
And when this sculpture goes to auction,
I will outbid everyone.

175
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,666
You'll buy it?

176
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,090
No one would appreciate it as much as me.

177
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,926
I understand the true value of your work.

178
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,096
I would never give up
this beautiful sculpture.

179
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,390
When I die, I want it buried with me.

180
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,935
Do you know why I like to hold auctions?

181
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,317
I love to watch them panic.
I just can't get enough of it.

182
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,111
Seeing their desperate little faces

183
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,989
when they realize their fate
is in someone else's hands.

184
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:46,539
And as their bids climb higher and higher,
they start begging for their lives.

185
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,877
Nothing else compares to it.

186
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,979
I thought you'd call me sooner.

187
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,232
Why him?

188
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,444
Why are you doing this?
I'm the one you want, aren't I?

189
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,404
I did what I had to.

190
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,365
I needed to get your attention somehow.

191
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,207
Let's keep innocent people
out of this, okay?

192
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,336
-Why don't we meet and we can settle this?
-Look at that.

193
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,214
I knew doing that
would force you to reach out.

194
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,341
-So now what?
-If you had called sooner,

195
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,218
your friend could have been spared.

196
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,596
He shouldn't be the one to suffer.
Don't you agree?

197
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,933
So what is it you want from me,
you fucking psycho?

198
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,269
All of this happened
because of your actions,

199
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,729
so I'll give you the chance to fix it.

200
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,539
Open the box in front of you.

201
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,178
That's the knife
that killed Assemblyman Baek.

202
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,390
You can take it, turn yourself in
and go back to prison

203
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,435
or write down the amount
you want on a blank check there.

204
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,411
I sincerely hope you make
the right choice and join me.

205
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,538
I'm trying to make this as easy
as possible,

206
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,415
but it's up to you.

207
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,834
The knife in your possession,

208
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,544
whose life will it end?

209
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,674
First, let me ask you something.

210
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,969
What's the reason that you're doing this?

211
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,847
Why do you take people--

212
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,099
And sculpt them to look like murderers?

213
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,478
That's easy.

214
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,563
It's because they were convenient to use.

215
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,857
They happened to be
where I needed them to be.

216
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,359
I like to think of it
as collateral damage.

217
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,695
Unfortunate but inevitable.

218
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,157
When people walk around,
sometimes they end up stepping on ants.

219
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,410
But do they ever feel
the need to apologize?

220
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,579
-Of course not.
-What's your point?

221
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,081
It's a simple observation.

222
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,500
I've also noticed something
pretty interesting.

223
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,043
I think before people die,

224
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,797
they stop fighting the inevitable
and accept fate.

225
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,384
I have a feeling Noh Yongsik
will prove me right today.

226
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,677
I get it. You win.

227
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,681
I already won this a while ago.

228
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,018
All I'm doing now
is cleaning up your mess.

229
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,563
I'm really doing you a favor,
so you should be saying thanks.

230
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,905
Hello?

231
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,374
Why can't he understand
when I'm being so clear?

232
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,338
Why does everyone
make things so hard? Huh?

233
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,150
Eunbi.

234
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,901
Papa!

235
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,155
That's my little girl.

236
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,574
Watch your step when you run, sweetheart.

237
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,784
Can you find me a four-leaf clover, Daddy?

238
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,203
Of course, darling.
Let's go find one together.

239
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,746
I think I know where they are.

240
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,751
We'll make sure to find you
the best four-leaf clover.

241
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:01,878
Do you see any?

242
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,509
-Papa!
-Eunbi.

243
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,095
Ta-da!

244
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,597
Guess how many awards I got?

245
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,475
What's with all those scratches on you?

246
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,644
Did you get in a fight?

247
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,855
I didn't start it.

248
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,816
The other kids at school
kept saying you were a loser.

249
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,903
Even if they did,
you should've walked away.

250
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,780
I tried to,
but they wouldn't leave me alone.

251
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,408
Listen, Eunbi.

252
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,869
Put that down for a second.

253
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,121
I have to explain
something important, okay?

254
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,918
For me to work hard in here
and earn as much as I can for us,

255
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,045
I need to focus on making money,

256
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,923
which means I won't have
a lot of time to see you.

257
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,799
So you shouldn't visit me anymore.

258
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,885
Why?

259
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,597
For now, it would be best
if you forget that I exist.

260
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,184
Okay? And if anyone asks,
don't tell them I'm your father.

261
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,603
Those people will make fun of you
if you do.

262
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,939
Well, you can go and tell them off,
can't you?

263
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,780
You know what?

264
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,491
I'm not your papa anymore.

265
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:14,992
Papa...

266
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,827
Don't call me that, okay?

267
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,205
From now on, you don't have a dad.

268
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,873
We don't know each other, got it?

269
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,667
Go.

270
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,001
And don't ever come back.

271
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,337
Papa! Papa, don't leave me!

272
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,173
Papa!

273
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,680
ELECTRONICS REPAIR SHOP

274
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,691
Eunbi.

275
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,117
I thought we didn't know each other.

276
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,334
You have nowhere to go?

277
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,962
Oh. It's just...

278
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,880
Whatever.

279
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,133
I guess this place is yours.

280
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,968
I've been wanting to leave anyways.

281
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,762
Wait, Eunbi. Hold on.

282
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,724
You stay here at the store.
I'll find somewhere else.

283
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,267
I'll go, okay?

284
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,228
Sorry.

285
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,985
Shit.

286
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,162
Are you deaf? I said I'm leaving,
so don't just walk away.

287
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,372
I... I'm sorry, sweetheart.

288
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,502
So...

289
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,839
You have to pay the rent.

290
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,050
Make sure you have the money every month.

291
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,801
Enough for utilities too.

292
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,804
What? Don't like it?

293
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,307
Uh, no, that all sounds really good.

294
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,851
This is your house now,
so I should pay you rent.

295
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,147
Actually, I've been itching to work again,

296
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,651
so paying rent won't be an issue,
even if it's not for rent--

297
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,160
Eunbi, why are you
so mean to your dad?

298
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,288
You always said how much you missed him
while he was in prison.

299
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,499
I don't know why I'm like this.

300
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,750
After seeing him again,

301
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,295
all I felt was anger and frustration.

302
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,465
That's because you love him, you know.

303
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,008
No, it's not.

304
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,387
Well, I like him.
Even if he's a little weird.

305
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,430
Like, why does he hide his money?

306
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,640
I know, right?

307
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,767
Trust me, I don't understand it either.

308
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,187
It always seemed strange,
but that's the way he is, I guess.

309
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,815
She kept pestering me to see you,
so I brought her in with me.

310
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,233
You only have ten minutes.

311
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,278
-I'll be back to get her.
-Okay.

312
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,529
I appreciate it, ma'am.

313
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,033
You okay?

314
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,411
They're feeding you every day, right?

315
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,415
And those cops,
they better not be abusing you in here.

316
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,085
You tell me if they are,
and I'll kill them all, okay?

317
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,630
How can you be laughing?

318
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,634
I was thinking how I wouldn't expect
anything less from you.

319
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,637
Shit.

320
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,108
Whatever happens to me in the future,
I want you to stay out of it.

321
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,321
-Why?
-Just do what I say.

322
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,406
Don't worry about me.

323
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,794
In my workbench,
take a look in the drawer at the bottom.

324
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,796
All the money in there is yours.

325
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,637
Coming.

326
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,265
What are you planning to do right now?

327
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,874
Breaking news. The suspect
in Assemblyman Baek's murder case

328
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,167
has finally confessed.

329
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,920
According to the confession,
after his release from prison,

330
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,922
the suspect found
the assemblyman's address

331
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,675
via a TV interview,
and sent him threatening letters.

332
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,052
But after no response,
the suspect murdered him.

333
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,513
It's him.
Didn't he just get released?

334
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,474
...whether to disclose personal details
of Mr. Noh,

335
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,476
who committed this premeditated murder

336
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,144
and a conclusion is expected soon.

337
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,939
Mr. Noh, who had persistently
denied the crime,

338
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,650
began to confess
after decisive evidence emerged

339
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,902
and the police are now focusing
all efforts

340
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,072
on securing additional evidence
based on his testimony.

341
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,122
I have an appointment
with Detective Hwang.

342
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,251
To be clear, you're admitting
that you threatened Assemblyman Baek,

343
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,212
and when things didn't go your way,
you killed him?

344
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,756
Yes, I killed him.

345
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,175
Why are you making me repeat myself
over and over?

346
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,594
I already said I did it.

347
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,387
What else do you want from me?

348
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,140
You guys win, okay? You caught me.

349
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,058
You found all that evidence at my house.

350
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,019
So don't you have everything you need?

351
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,813
That's enough.

352
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,777
Detective.

353
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,491
You know what the scariest thing
in prison is?

354
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,535
It's the other inmates.

355
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,664
That's why they're always trying
to prove how dangerous they are.

356
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,834
They put on a facade for protection

357
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,462
and pretend to be someone
that they're not.

358
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,882
I can spot those people from a mile away,
and I'm telling you,

359
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,425
that man is faking it.

360
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,302
Hmm.

361
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,767
Even with his confession,
you're still entertaining these theories.

362
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,060
It's not a theory!

363
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,063
It's experience.

364
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,981
They can't think in the long term.

365
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,483
They don't care.

366
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,945
Because of that, they'll throw
everything away in order to survive.

367
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,196
So what then?

368
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,282
What I saw in that room...

369
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,702
was someone lying to us.

370
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,914
Just to protect his family.

371
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,040
You think?

372
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,918
I'm pretty sure he admitted
to the whole thing.

373
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,172
I'm begging you to listen to me.

374
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,634
Enough of your shit.

375
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,305
Maybe you forgot, but he already
went to prison for murdering his wife.

376
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,393
All you need to do is stay in your lane

377
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,895
and leave the detective work
to the real authorities.

378
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,272
You're just a useless prison guard.

379
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,531
Who the fuck does
this asshole think he is?

380
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,675
What? He's not the killer?

381
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,553
Someone's claiming
he's the one who killed Assemblyman Baek!

382
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,887
What the hell?

383
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,724
-What's this asshole doing outside?
-I've no idea.

384
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,982
Put down the knife!

385
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,694
Bring him in.

386
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,037
What a surprise.

387
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,665
How you been?

388
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,587
Good work. Get the knife.

389
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,671
Understood, sir.

390
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,803
Let's go.

391
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,483
All right. Take a left up here.

392
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,109
Keep walking.

393
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,618
-Taejoong.
-Wait! Stop him.

394
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,078
-Hey. Keep moving!
-Wait. No!

395
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,413
-Taejoong!
-All right, don't make this difficult.

396
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,665
-Take him this way.
-I can't do this right now.

397
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,750
-Come on.
-Taejoong!

398
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,877
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

399
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,853
Give me your hands.

400
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,020
That's my little girl.

401
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,188
Papa!

402
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,900
Watch your step
when you run, sweetheart.

403
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,528
Can you find me
a four-leaf clover, Daddy?

404
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,364
Of course, darling.
Let's go find one together.

405
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,456
We'll make sure to find you
the best four-leaf clover.

406
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,292
Do you see any? Is that one?

407
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,384
Eunbi.

408
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,024
Go.

409
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,318
I said go.

410
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,069
I don't want to see you!

411
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,822
Eunbi.

412
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,618
If you like it there so much,
why bother coming out? Huh?

413
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,288
Is taking the blame
the only thing you know how to do?

414
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,498
What's wrong with you?

415
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,085
Why'd you confess to something
that you know you didn't do?

416
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,962
Eunbi.

417
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:39,343
I don't understand why you had to
go and turn yourself in like that.

418
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,844
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:44,222
I can't keep watching you leave
over and over again.

420
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,974
I'm so sorry.

421
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,519
I promise I'll never leave you again.

422
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,687
I'm sorry.

423
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,692
I'm sorry.

424
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,529
I'm right here.

425
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,615
No, no. Listen to me.

426
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,617
He showed up last night with the knife...

427
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,248
He turned himself in
so we weren't legally allowed

428
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,542
to detain Noh Yongsik
longer than 48 hours.

429
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,295
What?

430
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,966
What do you mean
you'll handle it yourself?

431
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,009
Hello? Mr. An?

432
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,262
Shit! I'm screwed, aren't I?

433
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,687
You. Leave.

434
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,397
-What?
-Get the fuck out.

435
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,865
What made you do this?

436
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,746
I gave you every opportunity
to make the smart choice, didn't I?

437
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,709
If you'd waited one more day,
Noh Yongsik would've killed himself.

438
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,127
You should've held out.

439
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,922
Why would you run head first
into your own death sentence?

440
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,007
Tell me.

441
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,971
No one ever answers me
when I'm speaking to them,

442
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,139
and I'm sick of it!

443
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,893
You don't get it.

444
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,521
You're asking the wrong questions.

445
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,525
So there's no use in giving you an answer.

446
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,696
It's funny...

447
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,615
I was always so curious.

448
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,537
I kept wondering who the fuck you were

449
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,331
and why you were doing
such horrible things to me.

450
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,959
But looking at you now, I realize...

451
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,378
you're nothing but a kid.

452
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,801
I'm getting bored, so I think we're done.

453
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,262
This is what you want?

454
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,930
You can die, then.

455
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,744
What happens after an escapee is caught?

456
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,538
We take custody
as according to procedure.

457
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,623
And after that?

458
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,209
There's usually another trial
for the criminal offenses.

459
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:22,005
But since he's already sentenced to life,
I'm not sure they can do much more.

460
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,174
Let's kill him, then.

461
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,383
What?

462
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,636
You can choose how you'd like to do it,

463
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,930
but just make sure you take care of it.

464
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,640
Okay, I understand.

465
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,714
2802, Park Taejoong.

466
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,258
I'm here to transport him.

467
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,511
Okay. I'll let them know you're here.

468
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,687
Park Taejoong.
Stand up so we can cuff you.

469
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,022
You're going back to prison.

470
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,244
-Welcome back, sir.
-Yeah.

471
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,260
I told you he was scheduled
to be interrogated more,

472
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,469
so why are you here?

473
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,430
You came earlier than expected.

474
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,309
If you need to question him, you can
just apply for visitation at the prison.

475
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,353
This is revenge for earlier?

476
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,648
I have to follow standard procedure.
I'm only a prison guard, remember?

477
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,318
You prison guards love your procedures,
don't you?

478
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,404
Okay.

479
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,742
Fine.

480
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,951
Get out of here.

481
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,620
Come on.

482
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,479
Let's go.

483
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,315
EMERGENCY TRANSFER
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

484
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,746
We've had to upgrade
a lot of things because of you.

485
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,209
The ventilation ducts,
we installed wire mesh.

486
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,419
There's increased security
for visitation, too.

487
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,592
Thanks to you, we're better off now.

488
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,642
Hey...

489
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:25,021
The items in that locker...
Why give them to me?

490
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,443
Those items are the key to the truth.

491
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:36,116
And you were the only one from the prison
that I felt I could give it to.

492
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,827
You have a lot of faith.

493
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,455
What if I had thrown those things away?

494
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,874
Come on.
You don't even throw away sick plants.

495
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,717
I heard you turned yourself in.

496
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,136
Does that mean you've given up now?

497
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,100
I don't know.

498
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,897
Actually, you're right. I'm done running.

499
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,108
You know...

500
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,236
I don't regret
turning myself in to save him.

501
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,411
Even back then...

502
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,957
I'm not sure I ever really understood you

503
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,127
and I don't think I ever will.

504
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,842
Hey, let's take a break
at the next rest stop.

505
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,177
Understood, sir.

506
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:43,058
GOYANG REST STOP

507
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,479
Since we're stopping,
I might as well use the bathroom.

508
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,434
Hands.

509
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,648
From this point on,
a new road is ahead of you.

510
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,570
What are you doing?

511
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,654
Get a move on.

512
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,408
Come on.

513
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,419
If you go that way,

514
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,588
a van will be waiting for you.

515
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,257
I wish I could do more.

516
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,800
I truly do.

517
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,552
But I have no real power.

518
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,637
I'm only a prison guard.

519
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,556
So this is the best I can do for you.

520
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,142
Go on.

521
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,061
Oh, and Taejoong,

522
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,314
next time, instead of prison,

523
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,608
I hope we meet somewhere better.

524
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,040
Park Taejoong.

525
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,917
I needed to prove my innocence.

526
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,294
So I'm at the culprit's location now.

527
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,049
Park Taejoong's whereabouts
have been found.

528
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,509
BUSAN TERMINAL AREA B

529
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,979
I was just
following orders from above.

530
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,816
Her name's So Hyeonjeong.

531
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,359
She's the next victim.

532
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,986
They'll begin sculpting with her soon.

533
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,988
We're creating evidence to use.

534
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,743
When a client commits murder, they look
for a victim to be the scapegoat.

535
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,206
Okay, I understand.

536
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,542
Consider it done.

537
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,627
Don't worry about 2802.

538
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,295
I'll make sure he ends up dead.

539
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,638
What have I gotten myself into?

540
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,171
Taejoong!

541
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,302
Hurry, over here!

542
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,803
Let's get moving.

543
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,142
You need an escape?

544
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,394
Get in.

545
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,729
Let's get out of here.

546
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,050
Why is he alone?

547
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,555
Why isn't 2802 with you?

548
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,723
Because, Warden,

549
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,810
after thinking about it,
I made a change of plans.

550
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,145
Are you fucking crazy?

551
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,355
Have you lost your mind?

552
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,148
You're gonna be disciplined for this.

553
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,443
Go ahead. Discipline me?

554
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,446
I've called Internal Affairs
and I'll tell them everything.

555
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
But what about you?

556
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,116
Will you admit
you were gonna kill him for money?

557
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,618
You stupid son of a bitch!

558
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,161
Where's all this coming from?

559
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,663
-This isn't like you.
-Shut up!

560
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,748
You shut your mouth.

561
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,752
Now, with the latest story
from the art world,

562
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,297
Arleli, the famous and mysterious artist,
has announced their decision

563
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,467
to finally reveal themselves
to the public for the first time.

564
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,678
Sources tell me that this will happen

565
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,597
at a special exhibition
unveiling the 100th sculpture.

566
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,226
Additionally, this piece will be
up for auction at the event,

567
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,478
stirring excitement in Korea's art scene.

568
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,146
-What's all this?
-Here.

569
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,444
I wasn't sure what we needed,
so I grabbed whatever I could.

570
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,116
Let's do it.

571
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,994
That son of a bitch
needs to be taught a lesson.

572
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,706
Just think of this as divine intervention.

573
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,431
The Manipulated
