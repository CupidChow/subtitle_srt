-Oh!
-Hey.

5
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,157
Taejoong!

6
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,950
Are you hurt?

7
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,035
What the heck happened to you?

8
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,837
Why'd you have to go and ruin everything?

9
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,424
Don't worry. I'll make sure
this never gets out.

10
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,303
It's just... my superiors have been
asking for a report,

11
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,347
and I'm not sure what to put in it.

12
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,641
I don't know if I can delay it
any further.

13
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,851
-What's the issue?
-I'm worried.

14
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,103
I don't want my neck on the line.

15
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,943
It just so happened all the inmates
died in a freak accident.

16
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,029
How could you have foreseen a gas leak?

17
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,199
Plus, the higher-ups won't even care,
since they're saving on taxes.

18
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,161
They won't bother asking questions,
so you'll be fine.

19
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,000
What about Inmate 2802?

20
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,549
I still can't believe he got away.

21
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,385
Destroyed my little playground
and everything.

22
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,139
We have to find that piece of shit.

23
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,808
Should I alert the media?

24
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,354
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

25
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,940
I don't want this out there.

26
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,735
-Sorry. That was a bad idea.
-Why so nervous?

27
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,945
Don't you trust me?

28
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,031
I don't know what I was thinking.

29
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,368
I'll do as you say. I trust you.

30
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,628
I wonder...

31
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:25,010
Now that he's made it out,
what do you think his next move is?

32
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,678
Sir?

33
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,432
You're dismissed.

Tell me not to wait for you.

36
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,241
I'll find them. I'll make them all pay
for what they did to you.

37
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,037
This is the land of opportunity.

38
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,976
Oh. You awake?

39
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,356
Hang on. Hey, hey.

40
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,736
-You sleep okay?
-Yeah. Oh, my head.

41
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,578
Are you feeling better?

42
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,413
Yeah.

43
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,796
Sorry I startled you last night.
You must have been shocked.

44
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,298
Well, you did show up
and scare me half to death...

45
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,842
but I'll live.

46
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,430
Oh. Here.

47
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,307
Eat some food, okay?

48
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,267
While it's still hot.

49
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,314
Come on. Don't be shy.

50
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,866
I attempted to visit you
multiple times, but...

51
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,204
they wouldn't let me in,
and wouldn't give me a reason.

52
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,210
I was thinking that
something horrible happened to you.

53
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,380
Sorry I made you worry
about me like that.

54
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,468
I have a million questions,
but this is the most important one.

55
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,595
What do you plan on doing next?

56
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,439
Whatever it is, do it here.

57
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,192
I'm not comfortable with that.

58
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,904
What if you get in trouble
for being my accomplice?

59
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,573
I don't know what you mean.

60
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,326
You suddenly barged into my store

61
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,829
and threatened to kill me
if I didn't help you.

62
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,291
I had no choice but to co-operate.
How am I an accomplice?

63
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,922
Taejoong, you didn't come here
on your own.

64
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,259
God sent you here
because it's part of his plan.

65
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,343
Hmm?

66
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,769
This is for you.

67
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,312
Take it.

68
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,856
Are you sure?

69
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,861
Should we say I took this phone
from you by force?

70
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,282
This can stay between us.

71
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,123
You need to get your strength back,
so hurry up and eat.

I told you I'd find you, didn't I?

86
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,130
I told you, I'm not the one
making the calls.

87
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,799
I was just following orders from above.

88

Oh, really? Who's giving you orders?

89
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,516
If I tell you that, they will kill me.

90
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,317

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,486
-Hold on.
-...before I lose my patience.

Wait a second. Hang on, please. Spare me.

I don't want to die like this.
Please spare me.

94
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:50,997
Talk!

95
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,460
Don't you get it?
I can't tell you--

96
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,635

What do you want with this person?

100
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,523
I have no idea.

101
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,820
Don't lie to me.

102
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,696
Her name is So Hyeonjung.

103
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,032
She's the next victim.

104
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,076
They'll begin sculpting with her soon.

105
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,203
What does that mean?

106
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,040
I can't tell you...

107
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,917
What is "sculpting"?

108
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,296
We're creating evidence to use.

109
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,302
When a client commits murder, they look
for a victim to be the scapegoat.

110
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,304
Bingo. Our culprit.

111
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,640
That's how they begin sculpting the story,

112
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,519
-by collecting what they need.
-What do you mean?

113
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,146
What do they collect?

114
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,317
Everything, from everyday household trash
to cigarette butts.

115
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,029
They collect anything
that could be linked to the victim,

116
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,574
then it's planted at the crime scene.

117
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,327
That's how we were able to frame you.

118
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,998
The better the evidence,
the better the fall, you cock-sucker!

119
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,918
Finally. What took you so fucking long?

120
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,508
Of course he doesn't show up
until I've already talked.

121
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,230
It's you.

122
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,576
Can you stop fucking around
and kill the guy?

123
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,163
Hey. A fucking loser like you
can't do shit about any of this.

124
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,831
Do you hear me?

125
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,638
Fucking bastard.

126
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,772
Do you understand
whose business you're fucking with?

127
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,653
Now I have to do my job
and get rid of you.

128
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,574
What about Taejin?

129
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,036
Was he killed
because you were just doing your job?

130
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,081
You killed him, didn't you?

131
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,918
Fucking piece of shit.

132
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,170
Shut up.

133
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,174
Want to know who killed your brother?

134
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,138
Look behind you.
That's who killed him, you fucking idiot.

135
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,396
What's wrong?

136
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,864
Instead of running like a coward,
you should die with some honor.

139
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,555
He got away?

140
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,308
It's fine.

141
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,940
It seems like you're a little upset.

142
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,780
It tastes bad. Has it gone sour?

143
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,283
You should dispose of it.

144
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,536
Yes, sir. Leave it to me.

145
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,080
I'm going for a walk.

146
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,613
Dammit.

147
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,078
-You look worn out.
-Ha.

148
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,739
I'm giving you
a good severance package.

149
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,285
Write the name of the person
you want to give it to.

150
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,915
Bastard.

151
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,378
Fine, then.

152
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,498
I feel better now.

153
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,758
I need you again.

154
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,137
I've made a mess.

155
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,517
Just dispose of the trash.

156
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,020
We can hire another.

163
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,973
At least tell me why.

164
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,267
All because I received
a little extra money?

165
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,938
That's why you tore me apart?
I know there's a reason you're doing this.

166
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:01,982
What do you want in exchange?

167
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,035
"5283."

168
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,997
Ah, shit. I hate rain.

169
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,921
What a nice car.

170
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,339
Ah, fuck.

171
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,523
I'm sure you must be frustrated.
I'm here to help you,

172
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,150
but I need you to do me a favor
in exchange.

173
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,318
You good with that?

174
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,195
So you saved my ass, huh?

175
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,367
I'll make sure
you're taken care of, though.

176
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,120
Just ensure that you get
this job done first,

177
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,498
and once that's finished,
I'll do whatever you need.

178
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,960
I promise you
they won't look into you anymore.

179
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,255
In addition to that,
how does a promotion sound?

180
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,423
Interested?

181
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,519
Okay, so what do you need me to do?

182
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,396
To track someone down.

183
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,401
All-Purpose General Electric

184
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,571
What does that mean? What is "sculpting"?

185
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,115
We're creating evidence to use.

186
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,825
When a client commits murder,

187
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,119
they look for a victim
to be the scapegoat.

188
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,621
That's how they begin sculpting the story,

189
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,248
by collecting what they need.

190
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,544
Wait, you mean to tell me this is real?

191
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,716
Yeah. She's the next target.

192
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,385
Her name is So Hyeonjung.

193
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,889
I'm guessing they've already started
tracking her movements,

194
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,682
just like they did with me.

195
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,226
Everything okay?

196
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,606
Not sure.
I want to see if she's all right.

197
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,399
Is everything okay with you?

198
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,903
-What?
-Are you doing okay with all of this?

199
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,488
All of what?

200
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,451
-Wait, what? What's going on?
-Come here, you poor thing.

201
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,163
I can't imagine what you're going through.

202
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,958
All this time being punished
for something you didn't do.

203
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,754
It must have felt like
the world was crumbling around you.

204
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,923
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you apologizing?

205
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,508
-I'm so sorry.
-My back!

206
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,260
-Wait, wait, wait. It hurts.
-Oh, right.

207
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,346
Sorry. Are you all right?

208
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,182
-It's fine.
-I should get you an icepack or something.

209
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,184
I'm sorry.

210
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,230
From now on, stay with me
and work from here,

211
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,149
and I'll help you
with anything you need, okay?

212
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,280
How do I get this thing to work?

213
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,990
-Hit the power.
-It's on.

214
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,367
-Is it plugged in?
-Yeah.

215
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,161
Then it's probably an issue with this.

216
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,209
It'll work once I connect it on here.
Hold on a second.

217
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,419
We need to
investigate the inmates.

218
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,131
-I told you "no."
-We have to figure out what happened.

219
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,215
Just let it go.

220
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,510
Can't you let me interrogate
the inmates who made it back?

221
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,428
Hey. Jeez.

222
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,098
For us to figure out how 2802 escaped,

223
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,892
we need testimonies
from those who were there,

224
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,311
and we can't ask them.
They're in a special unit.

225
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,565
-Why were they put there?
-I told you. They needed intensive care.

226
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,525
That's bull...

227
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:36,321
-Then they should be sent to a hospital.
-I'm just following orders, like you.

228
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,656
Then who's--

229
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,825
The warden is requesting you.

230
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,537
If you've got a problem, take it up
with the warden yourself. I've had enough.

231
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,003
Come in.

232
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,971
This is Detective Hwang.

233
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,766
-He's investigating inmate 2802's escape.
-I see.

234
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,103
Help him out with whatever he needs.

235
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,564
Actually, I wanted to speak to you
about that myself.

236
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,983
-Don't bother.
-I want to gather witness statements,

237
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,192
but Officer Kang won't--

238
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,612
-I'm the one who gave him that order.
-What?

239
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,531
If you keep asking around,
word is gonna spread.

240
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,909
We need to handle this discreetly.

241
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:25,037
Are you kidding me?
We should at least interrogate those--

242
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,788
Stop wasting your time on that.

243
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,291
Focus on catching the one that escaped.

244
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,168
Why can't you just do what you're told?

245
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,294
-Warden...
-Enough.

246
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,587
Inmate 2802 Park Taejoong

247
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,215
I need you to show me
where that scumbag stayed.

248
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,515
It's here.

249
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,854
Move.

250
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,107
Daily Routine Plan

251
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,525
Oh!

252
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,697
Look at this son-of-a-bitch. Wow.

253
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,034
He really followed
a strict schedule, didn't he?

254
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,410
Fucking crazy.

255
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,790
That's Park Taejoong.
He was a model prisoner.

256
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,959
Did he ever have any visitors?

257
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,505
What's this? Jackpot.

258
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,632
He hid it well. Wow.

259
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,094
He has no family.

260
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,763
He had friends that came by frequently,

261
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,891
but he refused their visits
and shut them out.

262
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,935
Would you like to look
at the visitors' log?

263
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,731
Those were important to him,
so be careful.

264
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,692
Who cares? He's a fucking inmate.

265
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,742
Looks like he was going over all of
these case documents quite obsessively.

266
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,827
They're so worn out.

267
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,872
"Park Taejoong, semen, 99%."

268
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,334
Think he forgot this?

269
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,547
Well, why don't you ask him yourself
when you catch him?

270
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,925
Huh.

271
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,105
Hi, Mommy!

272
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,441
-Hi, sweetheart.
-I brought the mail in for you.

273
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,151
-Here.
-Oh, yeah? Thank you.

274
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,154
You're so thoughtful.

275
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,031
Overdue Payment Notice

276
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,866
Overdue Payment Notice

277
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,123
Hey, there you are.

278
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,958
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's okay.

279
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,918
I'd love to touch up my roots.

280
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,046
Again? It's only been a month.

281
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,840
Seoyun, go inside and do your homework.

282
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,091
Okay.

283
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,328
Chansol Oriental Medicine Hospital

284
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,538
What a pity.

285
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,041
Poor kid is sick.

286
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,336
Let me get this straight.

287
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,424
So, there are guys following this woman
and tracking everything she's doing?

288
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,677
Yeah, I think so.

289
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,890
So, then, how are we supposed to find
the people who are following her?

290
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,268
We're gonna play the same game.

291
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,980
Hey, Taejoong,
here's everything.

292
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,191
I'm not sure why you asked
for all this stuff.

293
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,819
Well, check this out.

294
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,240
I can use this stuff
to build some cameras.

295
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,659
Hopefully they'll catch
at least one of those guys.

296
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,743
Ah.

297
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,581
-These still good?
-I think so.

298
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,790
That'll work.

299
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,175
Ah.

300
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:54,681
You should be the one
running this store. Wow.

301
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,308
How'd you think of this?

302
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,284
Here. I want you to have this.

303
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,662
-What's that for?
-Whatever you need.

304
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,457
-Oh, it's okay. I can't take that.
-Of course you can.

305
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,459
I want to help you pay for things.

306
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,252
-Come on.
-No, really, it's fine.

307
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,172
Don't be so stubborn,
and take it already, please.

308
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,715
-Come on, now.
-No, I...

309
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,513
Why do you store your money
in there like that?

310
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,017
Oh, you know, in case someone robs me.

311
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,315
You never saw this, okay?

312
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:57,786
Do Not Use

313
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,760
Why bother hiding it?

314
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,139
Ninety... one hundred thousand. All right.

315
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,765
-Excuse me.
-Oh, shit!

316
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,477
Who the fuck are you?

317
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,314
Can you please return that?

318
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,775
Exactly where you found it, okay?

319
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,654
Or what?
I don't even know who you are.

320
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,532
Hang on. Wait.

321
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,492
Let go!

322
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,414
Who do you think you are?

323
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,503
-Little shit. Who do you think you are?
-What the fuck?

324
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,214
I didn't know what size you were, so...

325
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,260
-Shit.
-Look. Caught a thief in your store.

326
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,596
Who raised you? Shame on you.

327
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,098
Let me go.

328
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,976
Eunbi? I...

329
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,354
-What? Eun...
-Shit.

330
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,359
Oh, shit.

331
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,945
Sorry. Let me introduce you two.

332
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,575
This is the guy I met in prison.
His name is Taejoong...

333
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,243
-What's your last name?
-It's Park.

334
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,497
Right. Park Taejoong. This is my daughter.

335
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,499
Who the fuck are you calling
your daughter?

336
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,087
Hey, it's rude to stare. Look away.

337
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,385
That's what I thought.

338
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,556
What a happy reunion.
Bet you really missed your son.

339
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,017
That a "welcome home" present?

340
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,520
Well, he doesn't have
any other clothes, so...

341
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,065
Ah, shit.

342
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,525
Hey.

343
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,402
Come out. We need to talk.

344
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,078
It's okay.

345
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,459
Oh, jeez.

346
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,422
Where are we going?

347
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,185
Hey, so, earlier...
I'm sorry for doing that.

348
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,895
-I...
-Whatever.

349
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,898
You have nowhere to live, right?

350
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,900
Is that why you're freeloading? Huh?

351
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,240
No, I... Your dad was helping me.

352
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,908
You have to pay if you stay.

353
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,412
Uh, 250,000 a week, upfront.

354
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,291
Take it or leave it. You got cash?

355
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,255
Shit.

356
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,508
Wait...

357
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,762
I'll come every Thursday
to collect the rent.

358
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,597
So have the money ready in advance.

359
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,850
-That's more than...
-Consider the rest as your deposit.

360
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,439
What? Fuck off.

361
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,112
-Oh, wait. One more thing.
-What?

362
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,283
Shit.

363
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,496
Now we're even.

364
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,876
-Don't snitch on me.
-I can't believe...

365
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,088
Get back here.

366
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,385
Oh, shit, that hurt.

367
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,849
Hey.

368
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
You okay?

369
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,234
-She beat you up?
-Me?

370
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,028
No, of... of course not.

371
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,739
Right. Did she ask for money?

372
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,117
-Yeah.
-How much?

373
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,956
Well, uh...

374
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,459
two hundred fifty a week.

375
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,796
Two hundred fifty thou...

376
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,258
She's a nice kid, I swear.

377
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,887
I haven't been a great dad.
She has a good heart, but...

378
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,556
More like a shitty heart.

379
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,182
-Huh? What?
-What?

380
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,226
I said, "She has a...

381
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,771
shining heart."

382
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,525
"Shining"?

383
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,577
Here you go.

384
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,706
Apparently this is that lawyer who met
with Park Taejoong in prison.

385
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,087
Park Taejoong. That bastard.

386
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,131
As soon as he escapes, he does this?

387
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,015
So you mean... you're positive
it was 2802 who did this?

388
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,394
I received this picture earlier.
Doesn't he look familiar?

389
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:08,448
It resembles him a little,
but I can't be sure because it's blurry.

390
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,117
Is that right?

391
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,954
I knew exactly who it was.
Can you really not tell?

392
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,045
So, what's the plan now?

393
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,924
Well, it seems he was close
with a guy who's been released.

394
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,967
Noh? Noh Yongsik?

395
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,011
Let's pay him a visit.

396
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,772
Did you stay up all night?

397
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,901
I managed to get
a little rest earlier.

398
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:51,032
Taejoong, your body
isn't fully recovered yet.

399
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,909
Don't push yourself too hard.

400
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,287
-Don't worry. I feel okay.
-You need rest.

401
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,166
Where do we even begin?

402
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,752
How are we supposed to figure out
who the bad guys are

403
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,880
-when there's so many people?
-I think I've found them.

404
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,050
-You did?
-Yeah.

405
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,762
I caught something interesting
on the cameras.

406
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,846
What?

407
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,307
-You see this?
-Yeah.

408
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,561
Over here. This person, and this car.

409
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,899
Every time that So Hyeonjung
showed up on the cameras, so did they,

410
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,442
and they all left when she did.

411
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,613
So these people are definitely
the ones behind this?

412
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:36,077
We're slowly figuring this out,
but I still don't understand something.

413
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,246
And what's that?

414
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,750
-The victim's phone.
-What about it?

415
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,336
I never had the phone
until I found it that night,

416
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,423
so how did the data show
that I had it longer than that?

417
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,800
It perfectly matched
your movements, right?

418
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,760
It's like it followed you around.

419
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,388
What?

420
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,473
-You're brilliant.
-Why?

421
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:58,558
Look.

422
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,644
See this? Here.

423
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,148
Oh. Is that So Hyeonjung there?

424
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,400
Yeah. See this motorcycle?

425
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,361
Looks like someone was
following her constantly.

426
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,198
They probably did
the exact same thing to you, right?

427
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,577
I have to get to her before it's too late.

428
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,556
All we have to do is swap those out.

429
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,308
Last piece.

430
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,653
Mobile Phone Unknown Caller

431
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,584
Good afternoon, sir.

432
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,799
-Where's your mom? Is she here?
-No, but she should be coming back soon.

433
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,925
From where?

434
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,428
Your mom, where did she go?

435
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,015
Some lady forgot her cell phone here,
so she's taking it to her.

436
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,100
Some...

437
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,438
You can wait here, if you want.

438
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,276
Well, actually, did your mom tell you
where she was going?

439
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,197
Seju Shopping Center
Parking Lot

440
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,658
Oh. Saeju shopping center parking lot.

441
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,915
Hello?

442
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,586
-Who is this?
-Shit.

443
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,880
I'm sorry, but my mom will be--

444
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,641
Oh, no. Well, that's not good.

445
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,102
Coming.

446
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,815
-Oh, Officer.
-How have you been?

447
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,192
Coming through. Move.

448
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,403
-Uh, hey...
-What's that smell?

449
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,988
Can I help you with something?

450
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,998
Yes. Yes, I'm getting off the bus now.

451
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,834
Are you here?

452
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,797
Do I walk over?
No, it's okay. It's not an issue.

453
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,926
I can go over to you. Stay there.
Okay, got it.

454
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,428
See you then.

455
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:33,272
You know Park Taejoong, right?
I heard you were close.

456
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,942
Have you had any contact
with him recently?

457
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,158
You don't look surprised
that I'm bringing him up.

458
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,701
Something you want to tell me?

459
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,373
Miss? Excuse me. Hello.

460
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,417
-Oh, is the phone yours?
-It is.

461
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,795
Whenever I'm talking,

462
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,715
you better look at me.

463
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,058
The Manipulated
