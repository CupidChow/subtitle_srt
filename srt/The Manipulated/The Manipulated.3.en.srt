1
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,957
The Manipulated

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,754
Now we have in an Arleli piece
with the starting bid at 2.3 billion won.

3
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,089
Do I hear 2.4?

4
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,799
We have 2.4 billion.

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,384
2.5?

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,970
2.5 has been phoned in. Now, 2.6?

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,224
From the floor, 2.6, by bidder number 40.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,559
Now do I hear 2.7 billion won?

9
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,316
Yes, we have an online bid
coming in at 2.7 billion won

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,943
by bidder number 56.

11
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,653
Now, do we have 2.8?

12
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,823
Yes. Thank you, bidder number 39.

13
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,867
Now, Arleli pieces
always fetch high prices

14
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,452
as they're highly sought after.

15
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,788
With every auction,
their genius as a sculptor

16
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,540
is reflected by these record prices.

17
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,627
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
to own a part of history

18
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,338
with this piece
from Arleli's "Wailing" series.

19
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,508
With that in mind,
do I hear 2.9 billion won?

20
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,390
We've received 2.9 from online.

21
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,977
That bidder now holds
the highest bid at 2.9 billion won.

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,438
Now, can we ask for three billion? Anyone?

23
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,735
We have three billion won
from bidder number 39 on the floor.

24
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,236
Since things are heating up,

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,447
I think it's time
to raise the bid increment

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,532
up to 500 million won.

27
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,909
3.5 billion.

28
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,245
Do I hear 3.5?

29
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,456
3.5 billion won.

30
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,044
Yes, from the online bidder.

31
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,796
The online bid stands
at the highest at 3.5 billion.

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,089
Do I have four?

33
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,554
Although it's a little unorthodox,

34
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,390
considering the high value
of a sculpture like this,

35
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,893
our bidders might need
extra time to decide.

36
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,396
So we'll take a five-minute break
and be back momentarily.

37
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,739
CHAIRMAN SHIN MYUNGHO

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,038
Is there anything else I can get you
instead of the art sculpture?

39
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,458
Something that has a set price
so I don't have to bid for it?

40
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,752
Let me ask you this, Mr. Chairman.

41
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,714
How much are you willing to pay
for your son's innocence?

42
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,344
See?

43
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,596
It's impossible to set a price, right?

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,598
I don't want anything else.

45
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,810
If you want your request to be fulfilled,

46
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,521
all you have to do
is bring me Arleli's piece.

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
If you refuse...

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,608
consider your request denied.

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,872
Without further ado,
we will resume the auction.

50
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,083
We left off at 3.5 billion won.

51
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,876
Do I hear four billion?

52
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,214
And we have bidder number 39
with four billion won.

53
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,676
Our online bidder, do I have 4.5 billion?

54
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,265
There it is. 4.5 billion...

55
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,891
...from online bidder number 56.

56
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,644
To our guest on the floor,
do I hear five billion?

57
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,689
You need five billion to stay in the race.

58
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,232
And we have five billion.

59
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,818
Once again,
the floor now has the highest bid.

60
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,738
To our online bidder,
do I hear 5.5 billion?

61
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:03,201
And we have it. That is 5.5 billion won
from our online bidder.

62
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,287
The highest bid is yours.

63
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,874
To our guest. Six billion?

64
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,086
Six billion. Bidder number 39,
I'll ask one last time.

65
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,172
Do I hear six?

66
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,466
This piece can be yours for six billion.

67
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,843
Do we have it?

68
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,344
Going once.

69
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,308
Thank you, sir. Now, 6.5?

70
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,270
Our online bidder? Do I have 6.5?

71
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,730
No?

72
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,442
If we don't hear from you,
we'll call it three times and close.

73
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,526
Final chance.

74
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,029
Going once.

75
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,698
Going twice.

76
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,410
You hit your limit, haven't you?
That's no fun.

77
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,624
Sold to bidder number 39
on the floor for six billion won.

78
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,875
Congratulations, sir.

79
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,072
Yes, Mr. Chairman. I received it.

80
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,285
Ah, right.
I forgot to mention this earlier.

81
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,538
The scapegoat who went to prison
for your son?

82
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,456
He's dead now.

83
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,003
He shoved pages from a Bible in his mouth
and managed to suffocate himself.

84
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,714
Didn't I tell you?

85
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,550
I promised to make
this incident disappear.

86
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,639
So now your son was never involved,
but I'm sure it's still bothering him.

87
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,100
Why don't you two take a vacation?

88
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,575
Building the data center
is a key national initiative.

89
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,368
It would be good PR for us.

90
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,746
We must do everything
in our power to win this bid.

91
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,415
Will this land acquisition costs
exceed our budget?

92
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,833
By about 30 percent.

93
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,628
It's too high
of a risk to go through with it.

94
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,839
It's a national project, so we need
to consider more than cost alone.

95
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,383
It won't matter what it is
if it bankrupts the company,

96
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,885
We can't afford to pursue this.

97
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,262
Come on,
what information are you looking at?

98
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,806
Are we looking at the same data?

99
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,184
Are you shitting me?

100
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,566
Yes?

101
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,027
We've been compromised.

102
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,320
I think we need cleanup.

103
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,864
Okay.

104
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,199
Send in the cleanup crew.

105
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,212
Just buy it. Pay whatever we have to.

106
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,089
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,944
Yes, understood, sir.

108
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,554
The Manipulated

109
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,902
Ready for another round?

110
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,780
I think I'll pass.

111
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,744
You guys hear the same thing I did?

112
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,953
He's got balls today.

113
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,164
Wow.

114
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,000
Did I hear you say

115
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,502
that "you'll pass"?
Like you have a choice?

116
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,547
"Think I'll pass."

117
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,007
Look at his face.

118
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,180
This guy here
has an important match tomorrow.

119
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,098
I'm not asking for much.

120
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,851
Just help him warm up.

121
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,811
Take the beating like a good boy.

122
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,156
You little shit.

123
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,408
Come on!

124
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,888
Come here, bitch!

125
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,976
-Ah!
-You're fucking dead.

126
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,117
From now on,

127
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,494
don't fuck with me.

128
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,510
ELECTRONICS REPAIR SHOP

129
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,227
Ah! Ah, shit.

130
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,478
My head's killing me.

131
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,188
That's what you get for last night.

132
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,274
Why do you always fight when you drink?

133
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,109
But I wasn't the one who started it.

134
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,028
We'll get you checked out after I'm done.

135
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,697
I don't have the money for that.

136
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,595
Fucking empty again.

137
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,316
Isn't that shit outdated?

138
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,820
Well...

139
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,214
Ah.

140
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,435
Aren't you precious?
Taking pictures together.

141
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,313
It's like you're family.

142
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:13,942
Sorry, I...

143
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,197
I placed an order for gimbap
but I haven't paid for it yet.

144
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,241
Shit.

145
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,127
If you find God in prison,

146
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,505
are all of your sins forgiven?

147
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,013
Jeez. What took you so long?

148
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,977
Okay.

149
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,521
Hey.

150
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,108
My head's feeling better.
Let's get some food instead, yeah?

151
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,235
Tteokbokki? Or jjajangmyeon?

152
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,070
Tofu?

153
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,408
What?

154
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,994
Nothing.

155
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,932
You scared me, Father. Come on in.

156
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,394
Why do you have guilt
written all over your face?

157
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,895
Oh, it's nothing.

158
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,315
Do you have a moment to talk right now?

159
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,399
Sure.

160
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,028
I'm here about Taejoong.

161
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,238
Has there been some kind of accident or...

162
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,617
This is mine.

163
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,081
Don't tell me something happened to him.

164
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,378
Hey, what the hell
are you looking at?

165
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,463
Eat your food.

166
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,722
I swear I'll pay you back.

167
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,100
It's just that I need a little
more time. Please have mercy on me.

168
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,352
From now on,

169
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,063
don't fuck with me.

170
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,277
Ah, fucking shit.

171
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,945
Where you going, sir?

172
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,822
To take a piss.

173
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,041
The vibe is so tense in here.

174
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,710
Everybody's barely
touching their food today.

175
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,212
You're clueless, aren't you?

176
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,756
-Didn't you hear what happened?
-No. What?

177
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,467
The boss got spanked by 2802.

178
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,676
Really?

179
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,261
-He got beat up?
-Yeah.

180
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,847
All he could do
was take it like a little bitch.

181
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,141
That's why he's been hiding
behind his thugs.

182
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,020
I guess we should take advantage of that
and eat our food in peace for once.

183
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,315
It's nice.

184
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,608
With them gone.

185
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,776
The food tastes better.

186
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,486
It really does.

187
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,806
Hello, sir.

188
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,016
What's going on?

189
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,227
Deoksu is inside.

190
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,770
It's so fucking noisy.

191
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,947
Hey, Etch-a-Sketch.

192
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,116
Look who it is.

193
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,701
What are you staring at?

194
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,874
The fuck's he looking at?

195
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,125
Calm down, kids.

196
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,881
Gangjae The Dickhead.

197
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,549
Did you have a nice vacation?

198
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,301
Long time no see.

199
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,928
Why did you come back here?
Just to suck dick?

200
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,017
Looks like you're still
getting your ass kicked.

201
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,735
You've gotten weak, old man.

202
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,948
What's going on?

203
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,201
Come on, break it up. Step away.

204
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,452
What's this?

205
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,245
You two again.

206
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,373
These animals.

207
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,752
You want to dig his grave?

208
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,254
You can dig yours while you're at it.

209
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,923
What? Am I gonna get a time out?

210
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,007
Follow me.

211
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,259
Quickly. The warden's waiting.

212
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,101
Come in here.

213
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,111
Fucking trash.

214
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,953
This is supposed to be a fight club.

215
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,496
Why isn't there any fighting?

216
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,625
I didn't set this up
so you could make some pocket change.

217
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,504
Listen, you need to have patience, sir.

218
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,799
Scouting good talent takes time, you know.

219
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,802
Yeah. And I heard you got
your ass kicked in the process.

220
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,722
So the rumor
has already gotten to you.

221
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,517
I'm the warden. I know everything.

222
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,272
There's another rumor
making its way around.

223
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,233
And I hope you enjoy
that one just as much.

224
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,822
That's actually why I came to see you.

225
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,740
Restrain yourself.

226
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,453
We had a kid kill himself,
and now it's become a major headache.

227
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,706
Shit.

228
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,624
It's nothing out of the ordinary.

229
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,419
The timing's bad.

230
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,629
One slip up is easy
to sweep under the rug,

231
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,965
but two becomes a management issue.

232
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,263
So what do you expect me to do?

233
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,225
Sit back, relax and enjoy the sun?

234
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,061
I've had enough of your complaining.

235
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,771
Stop pouting like a little kid.

236
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,274
That's a gift.

237
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,654
It's a list of new inmates arriving soon.

238
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,281
Two of them are white collar.

239
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,619
They committed financial crimes
and their stashes were never found.

240
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,288
Their pockets must be loaded.

241
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,332
I assigned them to your cell.

242
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,876
So suck them dry.

243
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,504
Sounds like something you'd be into.

244
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,268
-Hey.
-You cut your hair.

245
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,062
Yeah.

246
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,229
Is it weird?

247
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,106
No, it looks nice.

248
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,318
Have you been to the commissary?

249
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,820
They added so many new things
since my time here.

250
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,740
Oh, so instead of seeing me first,
that's where you went?

251
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,909
Oh, and while I was there,

252
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,828
I bought the best supplements
with the most vitamins for you.

253
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,082
-Make sure to take them every day.
-How's your repair shop?

254
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,376
-Is everything going well?
-Mmm-hmm.

255
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,670
It's really taking off.

256
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,380
Do you want some spending money?

257
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,966
Father came by.

258
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,136
He visited me at my store
saying he was worried about you.

259
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,555
I see. That's why you're here.

260
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,475
But judging by that smile, you seem fine.

261
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,727
Is there anything going on with you?

262
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,357
-What do you mean by that?
-For example...

263
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,236
you might be hearing a voice questioning

264
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,114
what the point of life is
when you're caged up like this.

265
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,324
And maybe it's not worth living.

266
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,827
Never crossed my mind.

267
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,162
That's good to hear.

268
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,249
And there's no one giving you
a hard time, right?

269
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,333
Right.

270
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,673
I spend too much time in my garden
and I'm really getting sick of the view.

271
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,384
But now I'm ready for something different.

272
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,637
What are you implying?

273
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,602
Taejoong.

274
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,647
Don't be stupid.

275
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,899
Hey, listen, Mr. Noh.

276
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,114
I swear I'm innocent.

277
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,290
I'm getting out of this prison.

278
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,843
You're not going to let
Park Taejoong get away with this, are you?

279
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,679
All those assholes
are talking shit behind our backs.

280
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,097
My hands are tied.

281
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,684
The warden told me to back off.

282
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,604
So I'm gonna.

283
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,651
Jiyong.

284
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,543
I might have to hold back...

285
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,881
but I can't bring myself to tell you to.

286
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,008
So go and have some fun for me.

287
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,176
I won't let you down.

288
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,201
MURDER SUSPECT APPREHENDED
SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON

289
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,414
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

290
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,920
All right. Time to get to work, everyone.

291
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,841
CELL BLOCK A

292
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,390
SUPPLY STORAGE ROOM

293
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,433
I'll need civilian clothes.

294
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,982
Security key cards for door access.

295
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,530
There's nothing new
going on with Block 7.

296
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,657
And zero to report
with the workshop as well.

297
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,741
Got it.

298
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,203
The guards change
shifts at 3:30.

299
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,122
That's when I need to make my move.

300
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,458
Zone B has the door
that leads to the outside.

301
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,254
I have to find a way to sneak in there
without the guards noticing

302
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,631
and utilize the ventilation ducts.

303
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,095
END OF VISITING HOURS
16:00

304
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,308
Visitation hours end promptly at 4:00 p.m.

305
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,148
And that's when
the food supply truck comes too.

306
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,859
So four's when my window closes.

307
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,547
Let's save the introductions for tomorrow.

308
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,936
I was gonna make it quick for you.

309
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,145
Who sent you?

310
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,605
Does it matter?

311
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,733
Come on, I want to hear you scream.
"Someone help!"

312
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,818
"Someone save me!"

313
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,321
Let's get on with it.

314
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,073
Okay.

315
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,886
Roll call!

316
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,754
There's one final obstacle
that I need to overcome.

317
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,104
Keep eating.

318
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,189
Okay.

319
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,568
All this shit you're doing...

320
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,987
having fun?

321
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,614
Does it look like I am?

322
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,199
Let's give it a rest.

323
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,533
If you stop now,

324
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,328
I'll forgive everything
you've done to me so far.

325
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,038
Forgive me?

326
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,998
Who the fuck do you think you are?

327
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,750
I should ask for forgiveness?

328
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,920
Let's see.

329
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,964
You know, that's not gonna happen
just because you want it to.

330
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,634
Tell you what?

331
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,678
If you want me to ask for forgiveness,

332
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,765
why don't you chop your dick off
and then go fuck yourself?

333
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,891
Then I'll consider it.

334
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,607
Wasn't your little sister sexually abused?

335
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,780
It was you, wasn't it?

336
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,157
You don't have to lie.

337
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,827
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

338
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,878
Ah!

339
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,268
Hey! Back up!

340
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,769
Stop right now!

341
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,354
Come on!

342
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,362
Taser! Taser! Taser!

343
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,489
What the hell's going on?

344
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,574
Move!

345
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,951
Lay him down on the ground.

346
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,035
What happened?

347
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,207
You okay?

348
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,754
Yeah, I'm fine.

349
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,257
Let's get you to the infirmary.

350
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,383
No, it's okay.

351
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,011
I'm all good. But this guy...

352
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,762
I think he might need a visit there.

353
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,435
And that takes care of him.

354
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,443
He seems like fun.

355
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,789
So the inmate
who assaulted you was punished.

356
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,666
Solitary confinement.

357
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,419
Although...

358
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,588
if you think that's too lenient,

359
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,133
you can bring it up
to the Ministry of Justice.

360
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,593
It's not that serious.

361
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,391
I can't seem to figure you out. Hmm.

362
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,894
What will it take for you
to raise a complaint?

363
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,520
Maybe you never will.

364
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,941
Here.

365
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,735
I don't know if this is
what you requested.

366
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,279
I asked for a green sponge
and they gave me that.

367
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,448
No, this is perfect.

368
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,992
I want to decorate the chapel
with some flowers.

369
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,243
Oh, sounds nice.

370
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,955
What's the point of flowers,
if you can't share them.

371
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,916
I can get you anything else you need.

372
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,626
-Just let me know.
-Thank you, sir.

373
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,628
Oh, right.

374
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,464
I saw that you applied
for cleaning duty in Zone B.

375
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,093
We can't transfer you
unless there's an opening.

376
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,095
But the way I see it,

377
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,764
Zone A is easier to clean anyways.

378
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,058
It's best to stay there.

379
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,378
What's this?

380
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,756
I'm running errands for Officer Yang.

381
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,841
Really?

382
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,218
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

383
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,287
Lights out soon.

384
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,420
Hey, should I be ready for round two?

385
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,255
Nah, don't worry.

386
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,259
After you slapped the shit out of me,
he just said to monitor you. So, yeah.

387
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,179
Why did he send you?

388
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,930
Is there a reason?

389
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,393
I'm good at ambushing people,

390
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,480
but with you, well,
we both know how that turned out.

391
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,194
I wish I didn't have to work.

392
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,112
-Seriously.
-Let's get this over with.

393
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,073
We should get going.

394
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,991
Go ahead. I need one more.

395
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,582
Making a living is hard in here, too.

396
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,342
Where's inmate 7423?

397
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,220
Any volunteers for Zone B?

398
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,639
Sure. I don't mind, sir.

399
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,683
CELL BLOCK B

400
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,814
You got here earlier than expected.

401
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,275
Welcome.

402
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,783
First round of vaccines for 250 inmates.

403
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:14,868
Right.

404
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,786
Come with me.

405
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,273
These are the inmates scheduled for today.

406
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,317
Medical records are separated.

407
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,029
We can proceed whenever you're ready.

408
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,113
I'll let them know.

409
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,458
2802 - PARK TAEJOONG

410
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,598
All right, everyone, listen up.

411
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,726
We've got vaccinations today.

412
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,812
Head to the infirmary after lunch.

413
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,106
Hurry up, you guys.

414
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,357
Come on, move out.

415
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,068
All right, go.

416
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,280
What's that?

417
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,447
What are you hiding?

418
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,910
You know you can't take that. Hey!

419
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,954
Why are you still working?

420
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,580
We can't eat yet because of you.

421
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,018
Sorry to make you do this.

422
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,937
Are you sure you're okay skipping lunch?

423
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,399
Yeah. I won't have time
if I don't do it now.

424
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,944
It started making weird noises recently,
and I can't figure it out.

425
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,366
I'll have it fixed
by the time you finish lunch.

426
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,161
I'll bring you a burger for your trouble.

427
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,787
After you eat, go get vaccinated.

428
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,332
-Okay. Sounds good.
-Hmm.

429
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,416
Thanks, bud.

430
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,339
Let's go.

431
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,844
Hey, you done?

432
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,929
Get some coffee.

433
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,847
Not now. I gotta go make a delivery.

434
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,554
What the hell is that noise?

435
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,224
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

436
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,393
I never said you could
mess around in here.

437
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:14,899
Already finished lunch?

438
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:21,197
Well, I took a look under the hood,
and for the most part, everything is fine.

439
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,491
But I think the issue
is with this damper pulley,

440
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,034
which is why I made this. But...

441
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,704
you might still have to replace it.

442
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,252
So will I be safe
to drive for long distances?

443
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,712
I think so.

444
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,214
The noise is gone for now,
but you should still get it

445
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,133
-checked out later.
-Thanks for the help.

446
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,801
-Here's your burger.
-Right.

447
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:42,886
Thank you.

448
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,266
All right. I'm gonna head back.

449
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,190
Hey, hold on.

450
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,611
You can't leave yet.

451
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,204
Arms up.

452
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,391
Okay, go on.

453
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,185
Thanks again.

454
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,769
What's up, man? Do Gangjae.

455
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,859
You better answer
when he talks to you, you fucking prick.

456
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,198
Why did you ruin the vibe
when we were just having introductions?

457
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,287
Sorry about that.

458
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,415
I'm a little busy right now.

459
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,959
You want to kill Deoksu
as much as I do, right?

460
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,756
You want to team up with me?

461
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,466
No, thank you.

462
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,845
It's embarrassing
if you refuse so quickly.

463
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,806
If you're not with us, you're against us.

464
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,225
So choose wisely.

465
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,855
See you around.

466
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,773
Enjoy your food.

467
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,281
What you got there?

468
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,494
Hey, let him go.

469
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,008
What an asshole!

470
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,801
I want him so fucking bad.

471
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,687
I don't think you truly
understand what you're up against.

472
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,690
In order to get here,
I had to drive over two mountains.

473
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,778
And when I arrived,
I had to pass through three entrances.

474
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,865
One of them even had armed guards
stationed in a watchtower.

475
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,326
I'm trying to make it
perfectly clear to you

476
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,954
about how impossible of a task this is.

477
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,748
It's not a matter of climbing
over a wall or two.

478
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,168
I'm not climbing
over any walls.

479
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,339
I'm walking out the front door.

480
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,313
Shut the door behind you.

481
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,282
Why the hell are you so late?

482
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,245
Skipped the vaccine, right?

483
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,330
Yeah.

484
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,006
You're all set.

485
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,218
You're Park Taejoong?

486
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,928
-Number 2802?
-Yes.

487
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,138
Have a seat.

488
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,941
Listen up.

489
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,403
There's a big match tomorrow...

490
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,865
and I need you in top shape,

491
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,868
so I sent somebody else
to get the vaccine in your place.

492
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,415
2802, Park Taejoong.

493
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,755
Hurry up and get it over with.

494
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,922
I have shit to do.

495
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,802
I bet a lot of money on you,

496
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,763
so you better win.

497
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,809
See you tomorrow.

498
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,274
Fuck me.

499
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,491
Hey.

500
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,494
Ready? It's go time.

501
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,080
Come on, hurry!

502
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,466
Give me one more. Come on!

503
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,176
-Hell, yeah!
-Get out of the way.

504
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,469
Officer.

505
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,805
If anything goes wrong,
the blame's on you.

506
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,765
Sir, you shouldn't worry so much.

507
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,850
If it goes wrong, it's my fault.

508
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,937
And if it goes well,
it's all thanks to you and you alone.

509
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,939
I love ass kissers like you.

510
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,316
I'm gonna take a smoke break
till everyone's ready.

511
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,318
-Okay, you got it, sir.
-All right.

512
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,374
The officers are gonna be so happy
you're part of this.

513
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,334
Look how jealous those guys are.

514
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,254
He's with us, you fucking assholes.

515
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,631
I told you I wasn't interested.

516
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,300
Well, I don't think
that's really up to you.

517
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,595
Don't you see?

518
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,099
Those fuckers won't stop
when the match is called.

519
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,352
You gotta win at all costs.

520
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,731
If you don't want to end up in solitary.

521
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,151
Why's he going over there?

522
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,569
Leave him be.

523
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,028
He's still on our team, right?

524
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,197
Hey, hey.

525
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,324
Hey!

526
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,326
Do you even know
what you doing?

527
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,536
Are you fucking crazy?

528
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,037
The warden will kill us.

529
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,498
Get your ass back here, Taejoong.

530
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,583
Satisfied?

531
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,168
I won, right?

532
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,753
You son of a bitch! You ruined it!

533
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,255
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

534
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,506
Taejoong! Come back!

535
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,591
Sir, no wait.

536
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,063
Oh, there he is.

537
