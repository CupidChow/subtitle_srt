Light.

2
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,250
Let me sleep.

3
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Enough!

4
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,870
Light.

5
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,560
Yes, everything, everything!

6
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:14,512
Hey! You're crazy? TO? Give me more!

7
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,860
Watch out, evil horse!

8
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:42,263
Class.

9
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,626
Hey boss, look, people are pouring in.

10
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,650
It should be thrown away.

11
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,930
I prefer to look for another horse.

12
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,766
Nothing bad. You look like fire!

13
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,090
Do you know that guy?

14
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,666
This is Master Lu Liang. In appearance, he is just
a clown with a horse in a movie studio.

15
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,429
But at one point, in Hong Kong, he was the best
double in the movie.

16
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,350
The whole country knew Master Lu.

17
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,756
KUNG FU STALLION

18
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,843
Written and directed by Larry Yan

19
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,039
Master Lu!

20
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,860
Surprise! Well, how's life?

21
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,540
TO! Dame, hello!

22
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,970
Where were you?

23
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,490
I already thought you were dead.

24
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:17,940
Dami, you are a joker. I just win.

25
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,210
Take, take it, I'll treat you. Aww!

26
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:26,160
Yeah, well, you're a retired specialist. What kind of work is there
?

27
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,960
How is your stable?

28
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
She is not for sale.

29
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,250
If you don't sell...

30
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,870
Confiscate.

31
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,440
Doesn't work, grandpa?

32
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,880
Did you see the horse? Excellent casing.

33
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,340
Lend me a horse for a couple of days.

34
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:51,883
Ladies, it's not funny. Without him... how can I pay the debt?

35
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,330
All! My jokes are over.

36
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,403
I take your stallion as payment of a debt.

37
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,990
No, no, please don't take Flame.

38
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,610
Take the horse.

39
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,970
No Dame. I... I beg you!

40
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Grab it.

41
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,696
It hurts, I guess.

42
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,530
Hey! Hands off the fire.

43
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,690
You shouldn't have listened to me.

44
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,590
Come on! Baby jump!

45
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:38,036
After him.

46
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,679
I miss him!

47
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,750
I'm sorry.

48
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:17,196
There!

49
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:22,672
Caution!

50
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:33,981
And who are you?

51
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,078
Crazy!

52
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:45,693
Excuse me.

53
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,603
The show must go on!

54
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Don't skip.

55
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:09,150
We have to... shrink somehow, friend.

56
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:15,698
Forward!

57
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,317
For for!
Where is?

58
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,583
Hey! Where are you?

59
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Well done.

60
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:50,104
There!

61
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,316
Fire follow me!

62
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:00,353
Go Go.

63
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,510
Where did grandpa go?

64
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,256
Climb!

65
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Master Lu.

66
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,460
Are you sleeping here again?

67
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:37,440
What about you, do you feel it?

68
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Did you fight with your wife?

69
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,940
She does not fight, she immediately kills.

70
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,519
Teacher!

71
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,343
Is my fool up?

72
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,250
Yes. I can't wait to meet your beloved.

73
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Dead person.

74
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,330
Are you Mr. Lou? Is he also Master Lou?

75
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,749
Yes, whats up?

76
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hello.

77
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,560
We are talking about your horse.

78
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,828
Three years ago you got
Mr. Van's horse from LAM.

79
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:46,074
Recently ended litigation litigation
"EL" and "DW Capital".

80
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:51,030
As a result, DI Capital received
the right to recover any property from ElM

81
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,180
and put it up for auction. Including the horse.

82
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,960
See for yourself.

83
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,253
Outside!
That?

84
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,006
This is my horse! if you don't go now

85
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,320
he will bite you.

86
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,580
Master, what's up?

87
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,453
They want to take Flame.
Have you lost your fear?

88
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,080
Are you going to beat us?

89
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,250
Nonsense.

90
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,330
He is crazy.

91
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,657
Suit up, Vin Diesel with minimum wage!
Check it out.

92
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,120
We will be back very soon.

93
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Fools!

94
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,320
I didn't understand a word.

95
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,678
A friend's company went bankrupt. Firepaw's mother
belonged to him.

96
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:01,800
Have Boss Wang call them. And he fixes everything.

97
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,410
He died a year ago.

98
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,510
If it was that easy, they wouldn't have come.

99
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,963
Stop swinging!

100
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,930
How annoying!

101
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,310
Teacher.

102
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,520
Maybe it's time to look for a lawyer?

103
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Okay, yes.

104
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,060
What will I pay you?

105
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,810
The request for execution
of the sentence was presented before this court.

106
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,180
A property of our client is auctioned to pay debts.

107
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,650
However, we would like to appeal
the decision of the lower court,

108
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,439
to protect the violated rights of our
client.

109
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,200
We ask that the auction be rescheduled.

110
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,780
He is still here.

111
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:17,541
Well, how are you, honey?

112
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,160
Why did you come here?

113
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,330
I am in trouble. We need your help.

114
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,910
I need a lawyer.

115
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,590
Have you broken the law?

116
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
What are you?

117
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,390
No, it's not like that at all. It is about Ogonyok,
my horse.

118
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:43,494
They want to take it away. Here, I need a lawyer.

119
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,587
You can search ads.

120
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,810
But I have come to you.

121
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,590
I am not a lawyer.

122
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,500
I am still learning.

123
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,260
I have no money.

124
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,470
Me too.

125
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm not asking you for money.

126
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,680
I ask you to help me in court.

127
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Lu Liang...

128
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,220
I don't want to meet you

129
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,280
Whatever you get into, figure it out yourself.

130
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,250
Do me a favor and disappear.

131
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,600
Dad, don't you love me anymore?

132
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:38,730
I love you so much, little girl.

133
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,444
But I don't want to live with my mom.

134
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,463
Well done. Excellent speech.

135
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,930
Come on, don't cry.
Enough. Come on.

136
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,801
Don't be afraid of anything. Do not be afraid. Bye sweetheart.

137
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,950
Baby, don't cry. We will see you soon.
Do not even think about it.

138
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,300
You won't see it.

139
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
Cattle?

140
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,390
Cattle.

141
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,830
Unfortunately.

142
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm sorry.

143
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,600
Sudden family problems.

144
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,880
I missed your first meeting.

145
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,063
In fact, I behaved vilely there.

146
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,340
I'm glad you didn't see it.

147
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,360
I proved that this man is a very bad father.

148
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,270
And separated him from his daughter.

149
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,510
Teacher.

150
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,370
David! Did someone post a fight?

151
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,420
Now no one is going to hire me.

152
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:50,909
Master Lu.

153
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,443
I came to invite you

154
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,070
and your horse to star in my movie.

155
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,730
To her.

156
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,000
But there will be tricky tricks.

157
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Will the fire do it?

158
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,292
Certainly. And how.

159
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,360
I have been teaching him since childhood.

160
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,020
He is my best student.
Yes, honey, come on.

161
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,970
Say hello.

162
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
Light.

163
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Will you be a star?

164
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,993
Superstar. Light - Horse - fire! High five!

165
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,050
Wow.

166
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,550
Baby, listen.

167
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,260
I beg you.

168
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,720
Let's practice.

169
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,326
Yeah, your dad... he lied a bit.

170
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,620
But finally we will have
the opportunity to rise from below.

171
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,810
What's the look? Don't turn your back.

172
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,820
The specialist's eyes should burn!

173
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,649
come on! Hop!

174
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,820
Waitress, more please.
You're crazy!

175
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,860
You can't drink that much coffee.

176
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,400
We have to discuss something.

177
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,099
my mom demands

178
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,830
reunion with his family.

179
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,750
How did you get off the chain?

180
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,600
Have you forgotten that I am an orphan?

181
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,930
My family tree is a stump.

182
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,240
Why did it suddenly start up?

183
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,020
We were thinking of getting married when you graduate.

184
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,730
I released it in front of her.

185
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,320
Well she immediately

186
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,430
settlement.

187
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,990
Well, tell him we haven't decided yet.

188
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,816
But we decided.
Not yet.

189
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,190
But this is a logical development of relations.

190
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,610
Yes, but only I will decide
when I get married.

191
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,530
Although I understand that you have old-fashioned parents
.

192
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,310
Thank you for understanding.

193
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,840
But in a global sense, you're right.

194
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,330
So do not hang your nose. Good luck.

195
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,490
Love.

196
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,070
Why are you meeting him?

197
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
bag,

198
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,080
Do me a favor please.

199
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,150
Please make peace with your father.

200
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,565
Good mom.

201
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:29,250
Enough already, okay?

202
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,890
You've been asking me this for a million years.

203
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,720
But he doesn't want to change.

204
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,640
And you again for the old.

205
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,160
And I will keep in
touch with him.

206
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,050
For your own good

207
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,890
But why?

208
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,920
So you don't regret it later.

209
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,190
For example,

210
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,040
When is your graduation

211
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,390
And a wedding.

212
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,210
And you won't be there?

213
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Of course I'll do it.

214
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
OK so.

215
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,256
I do not need it.

216
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,150
He did not keep his promises.

217
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,833
Leave! How dare you? Leave!

218
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:27,059
I didn't know her...

219
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,912
Waited till he left, huh?

220
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,420
I no longer have a father!

221
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,217
Promise me just one thing.

222
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,720
If your father finds you again

223
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,510
don't walk away from him.

224
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
promise me

225
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,762
Twinkle, you're going to be a super horse.

226
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,018
I can't refuse

227
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:47,975
We are looking for talent! Call.

228
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,159
Photo -15, ride - 50. Do you want a photo? TO?

229
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:20,347
But who has seen an Indian wave a spear?

230
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:30,402
come on
no thanks

231
00:21:37,322 --> 00:21:39,988
Only fifty per trip.

232
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:44,558
What are you doing?

233
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:45,662
Horses are not allowed.

234
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:47,622
I'm sorry.
Moron.

235
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,102
Look, there's a horse!

236
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:12,752
Hey, come on.

237
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:14,402
It is time to train.

238
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:16,992
First

239
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:20,462
rehearse your reaction.

240
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:24,958
Now I'm going to punch you in the face.

241
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,152
I will be gentle.

242
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:29,582
But be real, okay?

243
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:31,742
One two three.

244
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:36,212
But don't dodge. Stay still and wait for the hit.

245
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:41,882
Ogonyok, we are like filming a movie.
Why are you so serious?

246
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:44,042
Are you throwing me a gauntlet?

247
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,682
We won't get another chance like this.

248
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,212
I need to rehearse.

249
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:24,932
Judgment.

250
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:38,172
It's not mandatory.

251
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:40,532
Tell me more about the lawsuit.

252
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:42,362
If you need a lawyer, I

253
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:44,852
I can ask my boyfriend for help.

254
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,002
Do you have a boyfriend?

255
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,022
What's it called?

256
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,582
It is none of your business.

257
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:57,572
His name is Mickey.

258
00:23:58,322 --> 00:23:59,322
And who is he?

259
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:00,852
A lawyer?

260
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,952
It would be nice if his last name wasn't Mouse.

261
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:06,192
And is he smart?

262
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:23,999
No! Arrest!

263
00:24:42,572 --> 00:24:43,572
Hello Ogonyok.

264
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:46,445
My name is...Bao.

265
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,538
I hope these two get along there.

266
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,012
Sir...
why so nervous?

267
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:31,272
You are welcome.

268
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,107
Yes of course.

269
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:45,012
Can you fight?

270
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:50,352
Struggle?

271
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:57,482
to get to the hospital

272
00:25:58,142 --> 00:25:59,342
or behind bars, sir?

273
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,662
Never.

274
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:04,772
So how can you protect her?

275
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:06,552
I can do it in court.

276
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:07,872
Account?

277
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:14,732
What happened to your face?

278
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:20,072
Something so difficult?

279
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:30,782
Why so nervous?

280
00:26:32,582 --> 00:26:33,582
Nothing.

281
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:35,502
What was he talking about?

282
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:37,362
Us...

283
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:42,632
Haven't we talked about anything yet?

284
00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:46,052
We had a male conversation.

285
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:51,032
Get it, Mickey. Don't forget, your time
is money. There is no need to be scared.

286
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:52,902
Yes Yes. Well...

287
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:54,402
Let's get to the point.

288
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:57,242
And the thing is, you are our great and experienced lawyer.

289
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:58,601
Mister.

290
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:01,352
Please don't say I'm cool or experienced.

291
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:03,625
Generally, the university

292
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,632
I was only three years older than Bao.

293
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:14,042
My internship ended
a month ago. I just received my license.

294
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,022
I'm new to the office.

295
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,392
Just call him Mickey.

296
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:42,692
You and I are like brothers.

297
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:44,402
Pay off the debt as soon as you can.

298
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:46,062
The three million?

299
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:48,482
Black days happen.

300
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:54,522
Foal?

301
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:55,632
Yeah.

302
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:58,632
This is my mare.

303
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:00,522
If you want, take it.

304
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:03,492
Can?

305
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,008
He is not a resident. Crooked legs, bad lungs.

306
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:09,452
We will act with mercy.

307
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,555
Does that mean it's going to be euthanized?

308
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,212
They always do it.

309
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:31,082
They want to go with me?

310
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,232
Get up fast.

311
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,322
Well done.

312
00:29:05,132 --> 00:29:07,112
Now we are together forever.

313
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:09,452
What is your name baby?

314
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:14,752
Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid.

315
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:16,062
Well done.

316
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:18,182
Ankle, baby.

317
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:24,758
I know, I know, baby. That's all for today.
we are resting let's go let's go!

318
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:26,582
Go! Here!

319
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:28,802
Here here. Come here!

320
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:31,382
Well done! Well done!

321
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:32,462
Lynx!

322
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:34,032
Lynx!

323
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:46,262
You are handsome, right?

324
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:04,122
Get up, fool.

325
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,944
Don't get on your knees. Never!

326
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:30,652
Class.

327
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,172
What are you, sir?

328
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,652
Come on, pet him.

329
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:44,932
I don't want to

330
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:10,372
caressed

331
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,522
so what? On fire.

332
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:14,952
To be honest,

333
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:17,952
Legally, the situation is serious.

334
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:22,392
That's why we need your help brother.
He quickly became your brother.

335
00:31:22,992 --> 00:31:25,672
I mean Minnie. Oh, I'm sorry, Mickey.
Nothing.

336
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,975
Mickey, you have to cheer up.

337
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,132
A couple of boxing lessons?
No, thanks.

338
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:34,938
A man must be able to fight.

339
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:36,982
Then I'll show you.

340
00:31:37,118 --> 00:31:39,462
Student, let's show your brother how to fight.

341
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,235
Brother? I mean, me?

342
00:31:42,342 --> 00:31:43,962
Ogonyok is studying to be a double!

343
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:47,112
Attractive. Lesson number one.

344
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:49,338
How to take hits. Are you ready?

345
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,039
No, I'm not ready.
Look.

346
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:54,095
Honey, come on.

347
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:55,582
See?

348
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:57,342
Now there will be a coup. Continue.

349
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,822
That? did you dodge?

350
00:32:03,942 --> 00:32:05,832
He wouldn't beat his horse, would he?

351
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:08,142
So, Mickey, let's go.

352
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:11,142
You will put on a glove and hit him.

353
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:14,502
Can't. No sir. Can't.
And if he kicks?

354
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:15,952
He is a professional.

355
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:17,682
But I want to live.

356
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:19,222
Once.

357
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,432
No sir. I'm still so young.

358
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:22,817
Bag! Bag!

359
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:30,165
No.

360
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:31,342
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:33,882 --> 00:32:34,882
You are covered.

362
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:37,672
Friends?

363
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,150
Take it easy, take it easy.

364
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:45,898
Fire, bravo!

365
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:47,618
Sit down!

366
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:48,745
Lower!

367
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:49,912
Excellent.

368
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:51,562
Did you see that?

369
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:54,522
Sir, but you're faking.
No, this is acting.

370
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:56,172
It doesn't matter, I'm a lawyer.

371
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:57,857
We were not prepared for this.
Quietly.

372
00:32:57,882 --> 00:32:58,882
He likes you.

373
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,875
See? Scintillation!

374
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,022
Get up!

375
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:03,544
You've seen?

376
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:05,697
What a great guy he is!

377
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:06,892
I have an idea.

378
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,472
We are going to teach you to kiss.

379
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,677
So baby get up I will show.

380
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:13,572
I'm afraid he'll kick me!
Calm down, I'll show you.

381
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,492
Bao, say something.

382
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:19,852
Come on, kiss.

383
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:49,542
I hope you find the time

384
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:53,022
to see the
brightest debut of the new double.

385
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:56,172
Your father was the best in the profession.

386
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:58,032
Hello.
Excellent.

387
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,592
Don't worry, don't scare Lu's daughter!

388
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:01,806
Look.

389
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,132
Stay here while I go to work.

390
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:10,512
Do not wander around the site.

391
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:17,872
Come on, come on, come on.

392
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:19,994
boss he.
Good afternoon.

393
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:21,019
Director.

394
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:26,782
Are you ready with that?

395
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,442
Certainly. It's easier than ever.

396
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:31,912
It's time?

397
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,832
Well, go now.

398
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:35,872
We are ready?

399
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:37,312
Double one.

400
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:38,662
Scintillation.

401
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,748
Well go ahead. We are being filmed.

402
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,287
Ready?
In places!

403
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,567
And they started!

404
00:34:48,642 --> 00:34:49,642
Silence, silence, silence.

405
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:51,612
What happened? Scared?

406
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:53,982
What's happening? Who is it?

407
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:55,815
Where he came from?

408
00:34:56,322 --> 00:34:57,910
Sorry Sorry. Give me another double.

409
00:34:57,935 --> 00:34:58,948
come on

410
00:34:59,142 --> 00:35:00,142
Fire, are you ready?

411
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,712
After filming, you will be afraid.

412
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,718
Three, two, one. Began!

413
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,928
No no no. Arrest. Wait.

414
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:19,182
While we did not turn off anything, we are waiting for a decision.

415
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,242
Well, at whose expense are we standing?

416
00:35:23,682 --> 00:35:25,262
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?

417
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:26,532
How to shoot?

418
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,332
Why hire an amateur?

419
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:30,472
Come on, one more time.

420
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:31,732
Replace this.

421
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,092
We just wasted time.

422
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:35,302
Come on!

423
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,167
Oh okay.

424
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:40,422
Guys, give me a five minute break!

425
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:47,032
Master Lu.

426
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:49,042
Very sorry.

427
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:45,374
Leave me alone.

428
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:50,837
Yes, you go!

429
00:37:18,882 --> 00:37:19,882
Light.

430
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,372
OK dude.

431
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:23,592
We will not force you to do anything.

432
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,872
But if you yourself want

433
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:27,552
then you will succeed.

434
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,729
Do not be afraid. We are all with you. Yeah?

435
00:37:31,392 --> 00:37:32,392
come on

436
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,722
Silence, silence, silence.

437
00:38:20,442 --> 00:38:21,442
I let it go.

438
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:23,332
believe me sir

439
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:27,188
Good? What are frozen? Forward!

440
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:28,665
Get prepared!

441
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:31,632
Let's go everyone Let's go.
We are filming!

442
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,902
He'll be fine.

443
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:49,012
Make room.

444
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:54,942
Master Lu is still in the saddle.

445
00:39:58,988 --> 00:39:59,988
Wait!

446
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:04,605
Forward!

447
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:48,318
come on!

448
00:40:54,111 --> 00:40:55,111
Taken!

449
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:18,094
Thank you. Thank you all!

450
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,178
Yeah!

451
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:23,392
Scintillation!

452
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:27,472
I need it.

453
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:28,553
Yes I understand.

454
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:40,622
Come on One, two, three.

455
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:42,142
Can't.

456
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:43,898
Dad teaches.

457
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:45,232
He is good.

458
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:46,932
We are not afraid.

459
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:50,842
Baby.

460
00:41:51,402 --> 00:41:54,115
Carefully. Your sister is new. Yeah.

461
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,122
passed.

462
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,262
Now I'm letting go.

463
00:42:04,932 --> 00:42:05,932
Everything's fine?
YO...

464
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:38,742
Mr. Lu, you've been searched.

465
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:39,862
It's playground time.

466
00:42:40,235 --> 00:42:41,237
Excellent.

467
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:42,432
Your highlight.

468
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:45,492
You have to read your contract.

469
00:42:46,602 --> 00:42:49,241
Contract? I don't have it. Why is he?

470
00:42:49,362 --> 00:42:50,442
Very even necessary.

471
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:51,792
Useful in court.

472
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:54,072
I don't understand anything.

473
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:56,089
I will understand.

474
00:42:56,382 --> 00:42:57,382
The daughter will teach.

475
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:00,078
Cold.

476
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:05,259
Forward.

477
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:14,111
No no. You can't go there. No. Are you complete?
Yeah.

478
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:16,732
Good.

479
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:21,112
Regulation...

480
00:43:21,462 --> 00:43:22,572
Help kind people.

481
00:43:22,872 --> 00:43:24,432
Always be honest with everyone.

482
00:43:24,762 --> 00:43:26,561
Do not pretend. do not steal

483
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,992
Don't make fun of people and don't get into debt
.

484
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:32,991
Mister. What happens if we lose the case?

485
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:35,431
Practice, it will do you good.

486
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:39,552
Did you say "stay out"?

487
00:43:40,812 --> 00:43:42,445
Yes. Some nonsense!

488
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:43,848
This item is required.

489
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:44,872
Yes, it's a horse.

490
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:46,572
Why does an animal need a tent?

491
00:43:46,902 --> 00:43:49,332
To rest between
dangerous tricks.

492
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:52,302
Just like my dad.
Yes. He's a stuntman!

493
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:53,309
Signature!

494
00:43:56,892 --> 00:43:58,542
We start with four meters.

495
00:43:59,118 --> 00:44:00,582
Then go down to three.

496
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:03,921
Two meters to ride and one to fall.
Good?

497
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,442
Excellent.

498
00:44:07,032 --> 00:44:08,032
we sign

499
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:09,232
The group is waiting for you.

500
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:13,465
Sir, are you ready?
Yes, I'm ready.

501
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:10,612
Everything's fine.

502
00:45:14,382 --> 00:45:15,382
I am careful.

503
00:45:15,942 --> 00:45:16,942
Thank you.

504
00:45:52,632 --> 00:45:53,632
Shut up.

505
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:57,342
Sir, can we sit down comfortably and discuss everything?

506
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:58,795
No place is more convenient.

507
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:00,072
But I'm here on business.

508
00:46:00,547 --> 00:46:01,547
Well say it.

509
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:04,192
Cold.

510
00:46:06,672 --> 00:46:10,251
I went to the former employees of LEM, but
it did not work.

511
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:13,062
But there's one I haven't met yet.

512
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:14,712
Former owner of the mare.

513
00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:18,792
He will confirm that the Flame was
Mr. Wang's personal property.

514
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:24,072
Who let you get up and drink?

515
00:46:24,402 --> 00:46:25,602
But that's how you want it.

516
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:26,632
Feel!

517
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:28,927
The Pope is numb.

518
00:46:29,112 --> 00:46:30,552
She'll thank you later.

519
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:47,807
Thank you.

520
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:51,838
Hello. I am the president of the
Flying Dragon Company... Ho Xing.

521
00:46:52,182 --> 00:46:53,182
Hello.

522
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:54,502
Ask.

523
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:09,442
Ask.

524
00:47:09,612 --> 00:47:13,482
I have fifty horses of different breeds
from almost thirty countries.

525
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:16,932
I strive to collect first class horses.

526
00:47:17,142 --> 00:47:19,722
As you can see, they are given the best care.

527
00:47:20,055 --> 00:47:23,382
Mr. Lou, I'd like to talk
about your stallion.

528
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:27,319
Two million, but he still refuses.

529
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,622
You can imagine? It's not about the money here.

530
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:33,672
Okay, Mr. Zhang, I'll see what
you sent me and I'll call.

531
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,085
Boss.
come on

532
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:37,992
ELM lost the lawsuit against DeWye Capital.

533
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:41,365
Firepaw's mother: LinLon's mare was
owned by the company,

534
00:47:41,385 --> 00:47:43,008
Therefore, he is included in your list.

535
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:44,172
It will be put up for auction.

536
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,662
Curious.

537
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:52,392
Well, call DH Capital and make a deal with them.
Understood.

538
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,412
We will not agree to anything.

539
00:47:58,992 --> 00:47:59,992
Look. Who is it?

540
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:05,292
Don't touch my stuff.

541
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:07,872
How did you get in here?

542
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:10,171
You don't have a door.

543
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:12,775
Master Lou, nice to meet you.
Go out!

544
00:48:15,882 --> 00:48:18,222
You did not comply with
the court order willfully.

545
00:48:18,822 --> 00:48:21,582
We received an execution order
.

546
00:48:21,972 --> 00:48:23,625
Master Lou, check it out.

547
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,792
What a hungry horse.

548
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:35,872
Nothing.

549
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:37,242
We have many copies.

550
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:39,792
What is required of us?

551
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:41,952
This horse is...

552
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,352
Since you already went to court,

553
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,842
Now we can file a counterclaim. Good?

554
00:48:47,472 --> 00:48:49,122
Yes, theoretically.
Very good.

555
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:51,285
Shoot him down.
Hear.

556
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,182
Who are you?

557
00:48:53,502 --> 00:48:54,502
Your agent.

558
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:57,162
Is there a license?
How old are you?

559
00:48:57,441 --> 00:48:58,812
It is none of your business.

560
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:03,312
I didn't say I was your lawyer, did I?

561
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:04,992
I am a bailiff.

562
00:49:05,622 --> 00:49:06,622
Do not care?

563
00:49:09,402 --> 00:49:13,315
An order to execute
a lawsuit makes things much easier.

564
00:49:14,142 --> 00:49:16,482
I beg you to forget the way here.

565
00:49:16,782 --> 00:49:19,662
Tomorrow our lawyers will file objections to the lawsuit.

566
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:21,711
We believe that you have been misinformed.

567
00:49:21,736 --> 00:49:24,732
The horse is not owned
by your company. Anything else?

568
00:49:25,122 --> 00:49:27,762
And you think so...
All questions to the lawyer.

569
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:29,092
That's all.

570
00:49:29,982 --> 00:49:31,514
Honey, get them out.

571
00:49:33,498 --> 00:49:34,498
does it bite?

572
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:38,992
Wait.

573
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:41,474
Bag.

574
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:45,372
Class. You tore them up as souvenirs.

575
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:47,742
Epic earrings done!

576
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:50,917
You see, it's not for nothing that I study.

577
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,142
Scintillation. And your sister is great.

578
00:49:58,752 --> 00:50:00,162
What is "deviation"?

579
00:50:00,852 --> 00:50:02,682
If the judge does not support us,

580
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:04,272
that will not cancel your claim.

581
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:05,452
Then what?

582
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:08,502
Let's appeal
the court order again.

583
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:09,952
Good.

584
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:11,842
What does it mean?

585
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:13,162
The fire will not be taken.

586
00:50:14,202 --> 00:50:16,288
Ok, I like it. As.

587
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:23,352
Have you read the contract?

588
00:50:24,013 --> 00:50:26,774
There should be air conditioning. Turn it on.

589
00:50:28,094 --> 00:50:30,529
But it's cold here, and there's ice cold water.

590
00:50:30,554 --> 00:50:34,214
You might look great in shorts and
a t-shirt. But he is in a tight suit.

591
00:50:34,818 --> 00:50:35,818
But I...

592
00:50:36,644 --> 00:50:37,644
Enough.

593
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:39,534
Come here.

594
00:50:43,694 --> 00:50:44,694
Carefully.

595
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,164
There is no fugitive here.

596
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:50,274
And there, at the landing site,

597
00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:51,734
there will be nowhere to slow down.

598
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,224
But Lou... There's plenty of room.

599
00:50:54,614 --> 00:50:56,108
You just... try it.

600
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:57,474
Try it yourself.

601
00:50:59,294 --> 00:51:02,167
Listen, the run must be at least
thirty meters.

602
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,472
thirty meters?

603
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:07,424
It's true? You're sure?
Definitely.

604
00:51:07,784 --> 00:51:08,864
There is very little space here.

605
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:10,784
Why didn't you say it before?

606
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:13,064
We've built everything, and you're in denial.

607
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:15,464
I have invested so much money in this site.

608
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:17,504
Bao, let's talk.

609
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,944
Study the contract. Does it make up for missed deadlines?

610
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:27,134
But that's your problem.

611
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:28,754
Our problem?

612
00:51:29,204 --> 00:51:30,944
No, we're fine here.

613
00:51:31,274 --> 00:51:33,434
Look, if he doesn't jump...

614
00:51:33,644 --> 00:51:39,849
The whole group - illuminators, cameramen,
workers, decorators, make-up artists...

615
00:51:43,941 --> 00:51:45,854
...they won't get any money. Are you alright girl?

616
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,120
Who do you think you are?

617
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:50,354
Enough already to build a producer here under
my charge.

618
00:51:50,864 --> 00:51:53,504
Do you want air conditioning? Be glad there is air.

619
00:51:53,595 --> 00:51:54,595
¡Ey!

620
00:51:55,334 --> 00:51:57,644
If you talk to my daughter like that, I'll kill you.

621
00:51:57,854 --> 00:51:58,854
Hear.

622
00:51:59,354 --> 00:52:01,754
This playground is your daughter.

623
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:07,604
asked to build for you. It took us
more than a month. If you don't do the trick

624
00:52:07,844 --> 00:52:08,844
Do not bother,

625
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:11,204
my boss will kill me without you.

626
00:52:12,494 --> 00:52:13,494
I'll jump

627
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:14,934
There is no need.

628
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,497
Stop shaking. Time is money.
Do not touch her.

629
00:52:18,224 --> 00:52:19,224
Prepare the people.

630
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:21,474
Will you duck?

631
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:23,574
i will jump

632
00:52:23,794 --> 00:52:25,544
Good. I'm leaving, I'm leaving

633
00:52:25,814 --> 00:52:26,814
He's gone

634
00:52:27,074 --> 00:52:29,267
Everybody get ready. Are the cameras ready?

635
00:52:29,384 --> 00:52:31,615
Dad, you can't jump!

636
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
Bag.

637
00:52:33,524 --> 00:52:35,144
Our family has a rule.

638
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:37,814
If daddy gave his word,

639
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,964
daddy will keep it.

640
00:52:43,154 --> 00:52:45,374
Wait, when did you introduce this rule?

641
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:48,144
Today.

642
00:53:08,804 --> 00:53:10,009
Everything, everything, everything, everything, everything.

643
00:53:15,164 --> 00:53:16,316
Come on, for Bao's sake.

644
00:53:47,114 --> 00:53:48,114
Ready baby?

645
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:56,714
All cameras are motorized!

646
00:54:01,484 --> 00:54:02,834
Silence on the site.

647
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:04,044
Began!

648
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:11,589
Fire!

649
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:50,664
Yeah!!!!

650
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:54,098
Happened!

651
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:09,354
I'm sorry.

652
00:55:31,964 --> 00:55:32,964
Bag!

653
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:34,914
Do you have dinner?

654
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:37,314
Everyone has already heard. Well done.

655
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:40,884
double daughter

656
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:44,564
only as good as your
hardest trick.

657
00:55:44,954 --> 00:55:46,454
And today we surprised everyone.

658
00:55:47,234 --> 00:55:48,234
Good trick.

659
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:49,754
I have to celebrate.

660
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:53,834
Yes, to celebrate what miraculously didn't break.

661
00:55:54,014 --> 00:55:55,334
Everything needs to cheer up.

662
00:55:55,724 --> 00:55:57,614
Besides, who knows what's coming.

663
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,854
Illogical.

664
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:04,057
I told you you look like
a K-pop idol in that wig, man.

665
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:06,674
The girls will love it, yes.

666
00:56:07,424 --> 00:56:09,295
A client. to feel comfortable

667
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:12,044
Excellent.
You are Zhi, right?

668
00:56:12,224 --> 00:56:14,024
Yes.
Look around you, everything is for you.

669
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,464
Do you have Yong Wei's autograph?

670
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:19,653
Why the hell is it necessary? There's Yin! The best
stunt double.

671
00:56:23,744 --> 00:56:27,014
The scenes you do are
for young stuntmen.

672
00:56:27,944 --> 00:56:29,894
You are too old for this.

673
00:56:31,964 --> 00:56:32,964
But apart from the tricks,

674
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:35,594
I can not do anything

675
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:38,144
Yes, you are old, Master Lou.

676
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:40,784
Well, not exactly a disaster.

677
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:43,304
Well, you have to.

678
00:56:45,254 --> 00:56:47,984
What a sweet and moving image.

679
00:56:48,644 --> 00:56:49,644
Hi babe.

680
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:52,394
Master Lu.

681
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:54,044
Talk business?

682
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:56,504
Ladies, not now. I am with my daughter.

683
00:56:57,404 --> 00:56:58,404
With daughter?

684
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:01,964
Do you have secrets for her?

685
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:04,234
Then we'll talk, we'll have dinner.

686
00:57:05,624 --> 00:57:06,764
You owe me.

687
00:57:07,354 --> 00:57:09,074
If you don't pay now...

688
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,374
As you can see she...

689
00:57:22,303 --> 00:57:23,593
Take it away! Behind him.

690
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:31,425
Carefully.

691
00:57:40,226 --> 00:57:41,346
Get off her!

692
00:57:45,986 --> 00:57:46,986
Are you complete?

693
00:57:56,594 --> 00:57:58,754
The stars used
to have spittoons.

694
00:57:59,294 --> 00:58:00,704
Now they are not used.

695
00:58:03,107 --> 00:58:05,829
Crap. Hey Zhi, take care of the store.

696
00:58:12,344 --> 00:58:13,344
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

697
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,574
It's okay, hold on to me.

698
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,690
Get away, get away.

699
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:41,234
Hit a disabled person?

700
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,858
I'm on the plates as a terminator. Check.

701
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,290
come on

702
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:49,970
Police! Here's a bummer! Let's fight some more!
Where are you?

703
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:55,641
Bag!

704
00:58:55,694 --> 00:58:56,727
Drop it.

705
00:58:56,768 --> 00:58:57,808
Let's run!
I'm sorry.

706
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:58,834
Give me your hand.

707
00:59:00,765 --> 00:59:01,765
I have to run

708
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,033
Go Go.

709
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:22,610
Stop the horse! Stop!

710
00:59:26,144 --> 00:59:27,704
It's ok sir. Then we went.

711
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:29,324
Good night.

712
00:59:29,864 --> 00:59:30,864
Stop, Bao.

713
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,644
Can you visit me more often?

714
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:41,054
Stop bullying, I'll come.

715
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:43,154
Yeah, that guy started first.

716
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:46,300
And the Light really shined today.

717
00:59:58,484 --> 01:00:00,854
I was very glad that you

718
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:02,034
protected me.

719
01:00:15,914 --> 01:00:16,914
we also

720
01:00:18,254 --> 01:00:19,334
need protection.

721
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:25,724
Don't complain, complain like an old man.

722
01:00:27,379 --> 01:00:28,551
I will not leave you.

723
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:31,912
Bye bye.

724
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:37,708
Go home.

725
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:03,712
Why are you sad?

726
01:01:05,952 --> 01:01:06,952
dad said

727
01:01:07,842 --> 01:01:09,192
that needs protection.

728
01:01:12,342 --> 01:01:13,342
so strange

729
01:01:13,662 --> 01:01:15,732
It cannot be said that they are strangers to each other.

730
01:01:19,662 --> 01:01:21,192
But we weren't close.

731
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,882
My parents divorced very early.

732
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:28,662
I just saw it.

733
01:01:33,852 --> 01:01:35,566
everything everything Do not Cry.

734
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:37,272
what a good girl

735
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,042
I need to work.

736
01:01:39,522 --> 01:01:41,796
Yes, today is the night shift. I'm already waiting

737
01:01:41,821 --> 01:01:44,232
Leave if the work is more important.
Do you want to get divorced?

738
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:46,561
Hello Bao. Come here. Hug dad.

739
01:01:46,992 --> 01:01:48,672
Mom, who is this?

740
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:50,392
Your dad.

741
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:51,672
Come on, don't be afraid.

742
01:01:52,662 --> 01:01:53,662
Do not be afraid.

743
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:09,785
Elegant.
Yeah.

744
01:02:23,878 --> 01:02:24,878
Scintillation.

745
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:30,967
Scintillation! For for.

746
01:02:31,392 --> 01:02:32,847
Baby are you complete?

747
01:02:34,482 --> 01:02:35,482
Not hurt?

748
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,662
Dad is proud of you.

749
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:39,708
Class, class, class.

750
01:02:39,732 --> 01:02:40,732
Get prepared.

751
01:02:41,098 --> 01:02:42,451
Silence on the set!

752
01:02:42,476 --> 01:02:45,208
Three, two, one!

753
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:53,992
Are you okay, Ogonyok?

754
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:55,942
Not hurt?

755
01:02:55,967 --> 01:02:57,448
Well done. come on

756
01:03:03,972 --> 01:03:05,592
Why is Firefire covered in wounds?

757
01:03:06,222 --> 01:03:08,562
Can you at least
put him in danger?

758
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:11,652
They are just scratches.

759
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,422
You are too reckless.

760
01:03:14,922 --> 01:03:15,972
Reckless?

761
01:03:16,122 --> 01:03:17,122
You can not understand.

762
01:03:17,952 --> 01:03:19,572
Specialists have that job.

763
01:03:20,352 --> 01:03:23,202
Specialists yes, but Firepaw is not a specialist, Dad.

764
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:25,282
You're wrong.

765
01:03:25,872 --> 01:03:26,952
He is one of us.

766
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:28,962
You do not understand anything.

767
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,151
The time for people like you is over.

768
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:35,205
Ours is coming in here. Point and shoot!

769
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,312
Here is the explosion point.

770
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:39,522
You have to wait for the exact moment.

771
01:03:40,152 --> 01:03:41,152
Ready?

772
01:03:41,262 --> 01:03:42,668
Three! Two...

773
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:47,659
From the road!

774
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:49,739
It's too soon.
Call an ambulance!

775
01:03:49,932 --> 01:03:51,252
Extinguish! Extinguish! Faster.

776
01:03:58,722 --> 01:03:59,722
Take her home.

777
01:04:00,348 --> 01:04:01,348
It will be restored.

778
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:06,972
You may not be able to get back on your feet.

779
01:04:12,162 --> 01:04:14,149
I taught him and I'm sure

780
01:04:16,782 --> 01:04:17,782
she will rise

781
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:21,152
I have never been so scared.

782
01:04:22,606 --> 01:04:25,122
I didn't convince her to leave this job.

783
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:27,502
Specialist

784
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:29,682
live at risk

785
01:04:36,642 --> 01:04:38,322
tell me what is life

786
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:40,482
my dad and his friends

787
01:04:41,082 --> 01:04:42,132
Very simple.

788
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:44,422
Motor.

789
01:04:44,772 --> 01:04:45,772
Bounce.

790
01:04:46,422 --> 01:04:47,422
Hospital.

791
01:04:57,942 --> 01:05:01,542
Even if things go wrong,
don't be nervous. It's harmful.

792
01:05:01,742 --> 01:05:04,542
Do not be afraid. Better be glad for the teacher.

793
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:07,012
Good?

794
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:08,542
As?

795
01:05:10,158 --> 01:05:11,295
I will die laughing.

796
01:05:16,676 --> 01:05:17,676
And this?

797
01:05:19,152 --> 01:05:20,152
Will this fit?

798
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,232
Where is the clown nose?

799
01:05:29,262 --> 01:05:30,462
Well, is this better?

800
01:05:30,762 --> 01:05:32,442
This is not bad. Put on your shirt.

801
01:05:32,622 --> 01:05:33,622
Refuel?

802
01:05:34,212 --> 01:05:35,212
Can't.

803
01:05:43,242 --> 01:05:44,242
It's no big deal.

804
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,802
Master Lu, the main thing is that
you yourself like it.

805
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:51,322
Hello.

806
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:53,152
Hello.
Hello.

807
01:05:54,222 --> 01:05:55,602
Hello.
My parents.

808
01:05:55,948 --> 01:05:57,175
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

809
01:05:57,552 --> 01:06:00,058
I'm Donald. This is my wife, Daisy.

810
01:06:00,305 --> 01:06:01,305
Hello.

811
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:03,384
I... I'm Lou!

812
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:06,372
Please sit down, sit down.
Do not be shy.

813
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:08,092
Sit down.

814
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:13,848
Give me some water.

815
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:20,112
Are Mickey's parents really named Donald and Daisy?

816
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:24,582
His father is two hundred years old.

817
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,622
You're not a boy either.

818
01:06:31,302 --> 01:06:32,322
Hey! Menu!

819
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:33,922
Drinking water.

820
01:06:37,242 --> 01:06:38,892
King crab seven kilos.

821
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:41,472
Sir, we don't have that many.
It's true?

822
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:44,567
Is there a Himalayan civet?
That?

823
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:47,262
Himalayan civet.

824
01:06:47,487 --> 01:06:50,142
Sorry, we haven't even heard of this.

825
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:52,482
Clear.
You're always weird, dad.

826
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:54,082
I will order.

827
01:06:54,672 --> 01:06:57,342
That's what his mom and I ate on our first
date.

828
01:06:57,492 --> 01:06:58,492
And she was born.

829
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:03,954
Mr Lu.

830
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:06,702
What do you do for a living?

831
01:07:06,882 --> 01:07:07,882
¿I?

832
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:09,952
An important matter.

833
01:07:10,122 --> 01:07:11,172
I create movies.

834
01:07:12,852 --> 01:07:14,945
Creator! Interesting.

835
01:07:15,312 --> 01:07:17,112
I love the movies

836
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:19,032
Yasujiro Ozu.

837
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:20,952
Andrei Tarkovsky.

838
01:07:21,324 --> 01:07:23,871
And this Indian - Abbas.
He is Iranian, dad.

839
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:26,099
I just admire your work.

840
01:07:26,172 --> 01:07:28,136
Yes.
I'll be happy to discuss with you.

841
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:30,708
Necessarily. tell me mr lou

842
01:07:30,882 --> 01:07:33,762
What exactly do you do in the film industry?

843
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:34,962
Who I am?
Yeah.

844
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:37,985
I jump out of the houses, through the glass, into the fire.

845
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,681
I hold on to buses with an umbrella and
fly on cables.

846
01:07:51,552 --> 01:07:52,552
take more.

847
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:54,292
Don't let it.

848
01:07:55,722 --> 01:07:58,842
Oh no, I can't take it anymore.
Then I'll eat a mussel. Want?

849
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:00,412
No no.

850
01:08:02,194 --> 01:08:04,002
Dad, what's wrong with you today?

851
01:08:04,302 --> 01:08:05,502
Where are you in a hurry?

852
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:08,007
I'm sorry.

853
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:09,352
I will say.

854
01:08:09,762 --> 01:08:10,762
you do not know

855
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,972
On the first date with your mom

856
01:08:13,332 --> 01:08:14,982
I made her angry.

857
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:20,472
So it is not clear how I was born at all.
And then I loved it.

858
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:25,302
Well, girls are usually daddy's girls.

859
01:08:25,692 --> 01:08:28,782
They can see that they are
very close to each other.

860
01:08:29,802 --> 01:08:31,362
In fact, my dad and I

861
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:33,792
They haven't seen each other in over six years.

862
01:08:35,172 --> 01:08:37,392
And only recently they started talking again.

863
01:08:38,622 --> 01:08:40,332
You wanted to meet my parents.

864
01:08:41,052 --> 01:08:43,445
So, I only have one father like that left.

865
01:08:43,812 --> 01:08:44,812
I understand,

866
01:08:45,642 --> 01:08:48,012
It barely lived up to your expectations.

867
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:50,442
But in the end

868
01:08:51,042 --> 01:08:52,042
He's my dad.

869
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:59,172
I knew before dinner that I wouldn't
make a good impression on you.

870
01:09:00,612 --> 01:09:02,112
he can't pretend

871
01:09:02,502 --> 01:09:03,502
normal.

872
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:04,702
Absolutely.

873
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:06,492
But he is very good.

874
01:09:07,512 --> 01:09:08,592
And very honest.

875
01:09:09,252 --> 01:09:10,692
And I began to be proud of him.

876
01:09:10,992 --> 01:09:12,282
when i got to know

877
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:16,512
Of course, I won't let him dictate anything to me
.

878
01:09:17,472 --> 01:09:19,362
But I will definitely give it a shot.

879
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:21,732
be my real father

880
01:09:24,192 --> 01:09:25,192
I know,

881
01:09:26,357 --> 01:09:28,602
that marriage is the union of two families.

882
01:09:29,352 --> 01:09:30,972
I am not trained in manners.

883
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:32,922
But I hope that you

884
01:09:33,222 --> 01:09:34,632
don't reject my daughter

885
01:09:35,232 --> 01:09:36,342
for such a father.

886
01:09:37,332 --> 01:09:39,312
Not the best, to be honest.

887
01:09:41,232 --> 01:09:43,332
But since my daughter gives me a second chance,

888
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,412
I will try.

889
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:53,649
Nice to meet you.
See you later, uncle and aunt.

890
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,749
Bye bye.

891
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,134
Goodbye Sir.

892
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:03,202
Everybody is happy.

893
01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:06,552
You are really willing to try.

894
01:10:08,832 --> 01:10:09,882
How can I test?

895
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:12,702
I want you to teach Firepaw another way.

896
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:14,382
You don't have to handle it like that.

897
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:21,012
Twinkle is my horse,
it's up to me how to train him.

898
01:10:21,162 --> 01:10:22,162
And you don't have to go up

899
01:10:22,692 --> 01:10:23,692
not in your business.

900
01:10:32,442 --> 01:10:34,152
What has played enough in daddy?

901
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:37,722
I almost forgot who you are.

902
01:10:39,252 --> 01:10:40,663
You only think about work.

903
01:10:40,812 --> 01:10:41,812
You're a selfish.

904
01:10:41,892 --> 01:10:45,462
You are rude and impolite. You are
acting like a naughty child.

905
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,582
I was ready to accept.

906
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:51,372
But now I regret it.

907
01:10:52,302 --> 01:10:55,452
Even children are capable of compromise. I made
concessions

908
01:10:55,994 --> 01:10:57,432
and you don't care about anything.

909
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,052
I hoped you would understand.

910
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,342
I have it.

911
01:11:04,992 --> 01:11:07,032
If you don't need a father, don't come.

912
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:13,512
Did you hear that, mom?

913
01:11:15,612 --> 01:11:17,022
He will never change.

914
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:27,562
Teacher.

915
01:11:28,692 --> 01:11:29,692
Mother Lu.

916
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:31,342
We are ready.

917
01:11:34,392 --> 01:11:35,392
Thank you.

918
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:38,632
Buddy.

919
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:41,717
I might be wrong?

920
01:11:43,692 --> 01:11:44,692
Maybe,

921
01:11:45,012 --> 01:11:46,242
We need a change?

922
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:51,215
From this day forward, we will listen to her.

923
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:54,292
Come on.

924
01:11:55,182 --> 01:11:56,182
Forward.

925
01:11:57,019 --> 01:11:58,878
How is the leg? Nothing?

926
01:12:00,012 --> 01:12:01,012
..

927
01:12:26,382 --> 01:12:27,629
Scintillation. Leg!

928
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,572
Scintillation. Be careful.

929
01:12:45,626 --> 01:12:48,526
Be careful not to step on it. Take it aside!

930
01:13:03,221 --> 01:13:05,232
Bao, find your father's papers.

931
01:13:05,532 --> 01:13:07,062
Who knows what we will need.

932
01:13:19,332 --> 01:13:23,532
Insurance policy. The insured
is Lu. Beneficiary - Bao.

933
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:50,842
Hello Bao.

934
01:13:51,402 --> 01:13:52,482
What class are you in?

935
01:13:53,772 --> 01:13:54,772
Fifth.

936
01:13:55,272 --> 01:13:56,982
And why are you passing?

937
01:13:58,242 --> 01:13:59,242
How is your mom?

938
01:14:02,712 --> 01:14:03,852
I brought a gift.

939
01:14:07,512 --> 01:14:08,512
Honey, right?

940
01:14:08,933 --> 01:14:10,612
And then? Better.

941
01:14:20,887 --> 01:14:22,872
your dad took notes

942
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:24,492
all your meetings

943
01:14:24,672 --> 01:14:27,792
Then I watched them in a circle
when I missed you.

944
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:29,922
Countless times.

945
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:34,342
And always

946
01:14:35,082 --> 01:14:36,462
suffered terribly.

947
01:14:37,902 --> 01:14:38,902
Saying,

948
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:40,642
that very

949
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:43,092
suffers from the way things turned out.

950
01:14:43,355 --> 01:14:46,062
And looking forward to each new meeting of yours.

951
01:14:46,632 --> 01:14:47,982
And I regretted not being able

952
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:49,662
make you happy.

953
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,242
Dad.

954
01:15:52,752 --> 01:15:53,752
I'm sorry.

955
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,382
I didn't know anything

956
01:16:01,482 --> 01:16:02,592
Dad was stupid.

957
01:16:04,572 --> 01:16:05,572
I was blind.

958
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:20,442
Promise you won't leave me again.

959
01:16:24,308 --> 01:16:25,308
i will not quit

960
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:34,632
And risk less.

961
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:36,592
I will try.

962
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:39,708
It's true.

963
01:16:42,775 --> 01:16:43,775
And Ogonyok?

964
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,042
Enough of your tricks.

965
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,272
I promise.

966
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:52,151
It's true?
It's true.

967
01:17:04,782 --> 01:17:06,072
Well, what are you, millionaires?

968
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:07,512
Why spend money on me?

969
01:17:07,842 --> 01:17:08,922
I also have clothes.

970
01:17:09,552 --> 01:17:11,022
Throw away everything old.

971
01:17:11,652 --> 01:17:14,502
You will be our fashionista.
Yes, I have a lot of new clothes.

972
01:17:15,072 --> 01:17:17,412
And who will impress other parents?

973
01:17:21,072 --> 01:17:22,072
Bag?

974
01:17:22,782 --> 01:17:24,022
Come on, be bold.

975
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:29,632
Bag?

976
01:17:29,742 --> 01:17:31,855
What other parents?

977
01:17:32,592 --> 01:17:33,592
Whose parents?

978
01:17:37,782 --> 01:17:38,782
Bag.

979
01:17:39,582 --> 01:17:41,412
Please don't joke like that again.

980
01:17:42,432 --> 01:17:43,452
Broke my heart.

981
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:46,302
Well, I haven't actually said yes yet.

982
01:17:57,102 --> 01:18:00,122
Who said it would be cool?
I have excellent taste

983
01:18:00,162 --> 01:18:02,182
This is all I chose.
console yourself

984
01:18:13,932 --> 01:18:14,932
Don't be so hasty.

985
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:16,478
Take it easy.

986
01:18:16,782 --> 01:18:18,192
Are you throwing everything away?

987
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:21,252
Yes, it's reasonable. Here's another package.

988
01:18:21,732 --> 01:18:22,842
Look, this isn't stealing, is it?

989
01:18:23,862 --> 01:18:25,602
Trust treatment.
What article?

990
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:28,152
Three hundred thirty one.
Three hundred eleven.

991
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:29,332
How did you pass?

992
01:18:30,432 --> 01:18:31,542
This article is not applicable.

993
01:18:31,842 --> 01:18:34,288
Friendship theft.
Something new. But will be.

994
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,542
We run there.

995
01:18:39,342 --> 01:18:40,342
Youth.

996
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:41,512
Where did you go?

997
01:19:35,802 --> 01:19:36,802
Send Bao.

998
01:19:38,652 --> 01:19:39,762
Lou's will

999
01:19:41,622 --> 01:19:44,532
All my money and prizes
will be inherited by my daughter Bao.

1000
01:19:46,152 --> 01:19:49,152
As well as my property and a horse
named Fuego.

1001
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:22,182
There was so much pain.

1002
01:20:29,442 --> 01:20:30,442
A lot.

1003
01:20:31,782 --> 01:20:33,282
Do not look at me like that.

1004
01:20:35,688 --> 01:20:37,037
Dad, you're great.

1005
01:20:58,634 --> 01:20:59,634
Day.

1006
01:21:36,064 --> 01:21:37,064
come on

1007
01:21:53,864 --> 01:21:56,234
After the operation, they sent me to Hong Kong.

1008
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:58,830
I am complete, I am complete.

1009
01:21:59,474 --> 01:22:00,794
With brain damage.

1010
01:22:01,424 --> 01:22:03,224
He spent eight months in a coma.

1011
01:22:04,634 --> 01:22:06,494
I couldn't speak for over a year.

1012
01:22:07,724 --> 01:22:10,904
Much has been erased, amnesia.
Why did not you tell me?

1013
01:22:12,074 --> 01:22:13,544
I haven't worked for over a year.

1014
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,144
Spoiled.

1015
01:22:16,574 --> 01:22:17,574
Everyone left.

1016
01:22:18,824 --> 01:22:20,144
I'm stuck in debt.

1017
01:22:20,744 --> 01:22:22,677
Little by little it collapsed.

1018
01:22:23,624 --> 01:22:25,484
He went down to the bottom.

1019
01:22:27,284 --> 01:22:29,474
Due to this, he naturally fell into depression.

1020
01:22:30,584 --> 01:22:31,724
I saw no one.

1021
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:34,704
Including mom.

1022
01:22:37,214 --> 01:22:38,214
I was afraid.

1023
01:22:39,794 --> 01:22:41,144
And he let her down a lot.

1024
01:22:51,164 --> 01:22:52,164
Then I

1025
01:22:52,694 --> 01:22:54,284
I forgive you on his behalf.

1026
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:13,854
Here!

1027
01:23:21,674 --> 01:23:22,674
come on

1028
01:23:36,443 --> 01:23:37,803
Hug him tight.

1029
01:23:41,324 --> 01:23:42,324
Stop!

1030
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:39,890
Scintillation!

1031
01:24:40,605 --> 01:24:41,605
Aid!

1032
01:24:41,736 --> 01:24:42,736
Carefully.

1033
01:24:50,684 --> 01:24:52,464
Dude, forget about him.

1034
01:24:56,029 --> 01:24:57,229
Help daddy.

1035
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:58,890
There are many of them here.

1036
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:10,323
Young man, weren't you taught to respect your elders?

1037
01:25:11,654 --> 01:25:12,654
I respect you.

1038
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:16,116
Fighting is not good.

1039
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:19,980
So why are you fighting with yourself?

1040
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,574
Scintillation. Your dad is being beaten.

1041
01:25:28,964 --> 01:25:30,374
Are you sitting and relaxed?

1042
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,134
Good girl. Feel.

1043
01:25:33,314 --> 01:25:35,594
Who do you listen to?
What are you waiting for?

1044
01:25:35,841 --> 01:25:36,841
Beat him!
That?

1045
01:25:37,064 --> 01:25:38,064
Second round?

1046
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:44,604
Climb!

1047
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:02,895
Wait wait. Wait.

1048
01:26:04,634 --> 01:26:05,634
Are you tired?

1049
01:26:07,724 --> 01:26:08,724
No!

1050
01:26:47,021 --> 01:26:48,381
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1051
01:26:55,302 --> 01:26:56,302
Let go!

1052
01:27:01,498 --> 01:27:02,498
Are you complete?

1053
01:27:03,764 --> 01:27:05,477
Why didn't you... drop it?

1054
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:07,947
My hands are stuck.
And don't fight.

1055
01:27:11,714 --> 01:27:13,934
Now. Wait, I'll bring it to you.

1056
01:27:14,511 --> 01:27:15,511
Help the boss.

1057
01:27:18,074 --> 01:27:19,074
Let's go

1058
01:27:24,224 --> 01:27:25,224
Ladies.

1059
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:32,454
Hear.

1060
01:27:33,464 --> 01:27:34,544
You are a normal boy.

1061
01:27:35,294 --> 01:27:36,734
Why are you doing this?

1062
01:27:37,454 --> 01:27:38,774
There has to be something.

1063
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,484
You are a kung fu master.

1064
01:27:40,754 --> 01:27:42,854
You don't have to be a collector.

1065
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,114
Work needs to change.

1066
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:48,374
Become a stuntman and lie like a corpse in front of
the camera?

1067
01:27:49,154 --> 01:27:51,764
Early in my career, I excelled in corpse roles.

1068
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,354
That's how they noticed me.

1069
01:27:53,954 --> 01:27:54,954
I can teach.

1070
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:57,204
Next time.

1071
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:00,404
You will be my student.

1072
01:28:02,024 --> 01:28:03,764
But don't fight with your brother.

1073
01:28:03,884 --> 01:28:05,324
By the way, here it is.

1074
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:06,364
WHO?

1075
01:28:08,474 --> 01:28:09,474
Hold on ladies.

1076
01:28:09,554 --> 01:28:10,694
But what about the money?

1077
01:28:36,074 --> 01:28:37,074
¡ Yun Wei!

1078
01:28:38,984 --> 01:28:39,984
Master Lu.

1079
01:28:43,004 --> 01:28:44,004
What is this?

1080
01:28:45,254 --> 01:28:46,254
brother,

1081
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:48,434
How did you get here?

1082
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:50,324
No company, no home either.

1083
01:28:50,984 --> 01:28:52,484
Packed and shipped.

1084
01:28:54,074 --> 01:28:56,114
Enough space, no one interferes.

1085
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,360
Near work.

1086
01:29:00,494 --> 01:29:01,494
You are still the same.

1087
01:29:01,994 --> 01:29:03,284
It hasn't changed at all.

1088
01:29:03,614 --> 01:29:04,994
You care about others.

1089
01:29:05,839 --> 01:29:07,532
Don't think about your pain.

1090
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:09,054
Everything's fine.

1091
01:29:09,584 --> 01:29:13,304
I rejoice in the success of my students and
friends. Come on, sit down, sit down.

1092
01:29:18,134 --> 01:29:19,587
What destinations? Talk.

1093
01:29:21,014 --> 01:29:22,014
that paper

1094
01:29:22,904 --> 01:29:24,554
after which I became a star,

1095
01:29:25,724 --> 01:29:26,724
she was yours

1096
01:29:27,464 --> 01:29:29,144
It's all nonsense.

1097
01:29:29,984 --> 01:29:32,174
They were looking for a bright young talent.

1098
01:29:32,954 --> 01:29:33,954
And found.

1099
01:29:34,364 --> 01:29:35,444
You are a big star.

1100
01:29:38,684 --> 01:29:40,274
After moving to Hong Kong,

1101
01:29:41,684 --> 01:29:44,954
I couldn't even afford the noodles
. You brought me to the shoot.

1102
01:29:46,096 --> 01:29:47,654
I was so reckless

1103
01:29:48,254 --> 01:29:49,254
if not you,

1104
01:29:51,014 --> 01:29:52,014
I would have died.

1105
01:29:53,624 --> 01:29:55,574
I wouldn't let that happen, honey.

1106
01:29:56,594 --> 01:29:57,794
it's easy to jump

1107
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:00,554
hard to land.

1108
01:30:03,974 --> 01:30:04,974
It's easy to jump.

1109
01:30:06,584 --> 01:30:07,634
The landing is difficult.

1110
01:30:14,324 --> 01:30:15,734
I started as a specialist.

1111
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:18,194
And now I want to pay tribute

1112
01:30:18,494 --> 01:30:20,264
the true spirit of specialists.

1113
01:30:20,894 --> 01:30:23,054
Let's make a movie about them. My movie.

1114
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:26,144
Like old times. And you will lead.

1115
01:30:28,754 --> 01:30:32,024
I'm too old for this.
The daughter forbids doing tricks.

1116
01:30:32,117 --> 01:30:33,124
But be afraid.

1117
01:30:33,284 --> 01:30:36,176
We have the best equipment and
safety equipment.

1118
01:30:36,243 --> 01:30:37,923
It's not about safety.

1119
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:40,470
Brother.

1120
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:42,970
You've always been in the shadows.

1121
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,860
on the big screen were

1122
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:46,390
Others.

1123
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:51,100
The time has come for
yours to finally appear in it.

1124
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,230
Assistant

1125
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:13,430
asked a lot.

1126
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,680
The for sale.

1127
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:17,530
Come on sit down. You will manage quickly.

1128
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,540
Baby.

1129
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:42,860
Dad is old.

1130
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,670
But he wasn't used to giving up easily.

1131
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:49,390
Current viewers do not know our achievements.

1132
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:52,150
Someone has to show them.

1133
01:31:53,534 --> 01:31:55,180
Yun Wei has a great idea.

1134
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:57,040
I was very moved.

1135
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Baby.

1136
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,360
Listen, dad.

1137
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,200
You are not just any stallion.

1138
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,110
You have great potential.

1139
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:16,720
All you need is an opportunity.

1140
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,890
And your talent will conquer all.
Don't be afraid, I'll help you.

1141
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,540
We train.

1142
01:32:24,316 --> 01:32:25,316
Was

1143
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:26,710
Yes, is here.

1144
01:32:27,137 --> 01:32:28,137
Dad!

1145
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:29,789
We found evidence.

1146
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,060
By.

1147
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,440
We got in touch with Linlon's former owner. He said
that he belonged to Wang personally.

1148
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:41,410
Didn't the flame belong to the company?
Definitely.

1149
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,000
thanks mickey

1150
01:32:46,767 --> 01:32:47,807
Thank you all.

1151
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:49,010
Not at all, sir.

1152
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,953
Thanks Bao. Thank you.

1153
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,210
What are you doing?

1154
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:08,566
Wait wait.

1155
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:09,650
Listen to me, Bao.

1156
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,240
You know the movie star Yun Wei, right?

1157
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:16,420
He gives us a unique opportunity.

1158
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:18,880
I must agree

1159
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,580
What does must mean?

1160
01:33:24,993 --> 01:33:27,130
You children don't understand.

1161
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:29,080
You don't understand this.

1162
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,460
Do you want to risk it?

1163
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:32,630
But for what?

1164
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,940
For fame?

1165
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:36,470
Pride?

1166
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,250
The so-called stunt spirit?

1167
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,640
true specialists

1168
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:45,740
do not retire

1169
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,390
Specialists do not break the promise they made to your daughter.

1170
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:01,052
Baoo, please. Wait, Bao.

1171
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,622
A very important scene.

1172
01:34:20,647 --> 01:34:22,693
Three, two, one. Engine!

1173
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,760
Brother.

1174
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:34,670
Brother.

1175
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:36,230
our director

1176
01:34:36,256 --> 01:34:37,603
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

1177
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:39,850
Yun Wei talks about you all the time.

1178
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:41,770
Teacher.
He is wearing a vest.

1179
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,980
Look.

1180
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,100
This is a digital preview of the scene.

1181
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:55,970
Awesome!

1182
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,300
Now they watch cartoons before they shoot, right?

1183
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:00,910
Yes, not like before.

1184
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:04,930
This will help us add cj during
final editing.

1185
01:35:05,093 --> 01:35:06,106
That?

1186
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:08,470
Ordinary computer graphics.
Special effects.

1187
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,720
effects

1188
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:12,520
We are all getting ready to
adjust to the fall.

1189
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:14,170
So, prepare your horse.

1190
01:35:15,370 --> 01:35:16,370
And this is for you.

1191
01:35:18,867 --> 01:35:19,867
We will do

1192
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:21,800
TRUE.

1193
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,290
Excuse me, how is it?

1194
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:25,630
Fire and I will make a fall.

1195
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,680
So that?

1196
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:29,320
Wait, are you kidding?

1197
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,780
Now they don't really fall off.

1198
01:35:32,066 --> 01:35:34,570
So you're lying to the audience.

1199
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,130
We use technology.

1200
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,300
Why take the risk?

1201
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:44,110
Do you think I can't?
Brother, that's not the point.

1202
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,972
Master Lu, please don't be stubborn.
It's okay, I won't bother you. I'm sorry.

1203
01:35:48,997 --> 01:35:50,130
Wait. Brother.

1204
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:53,260
I'm sorry. I am going to talk with them. I'm sorry.

1205
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:55,563
Excuse me, give us a minute.
OK.

1206
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:59,350
Look, there are new ways to film.

1207
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:03,308
But it kills the spirit of stunts.

1208
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:06,730
Brother, listen...
I don't want to hear anything. We shoot as before.

1209
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:08,650
Or we do not shoot at all.

1210
01:36:09,834 --> 01:36:11,701
One more word and I'll be gone.

1211
01:36:12,095 --> 01:36:13,400
Ok go!

1212
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:16,660
I want to glorify you, not film your
death.

1213
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:20,200
If I resort to these things,

1214
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,790
I will never forgive myself.

1215
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:24,460
I need a real movie

1216
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:27,790
then shoot for real, like before.

1217
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,750
Guileless.

1218
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:34,070
I'll go get ready.

1219
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,380
Baby.

1220
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:50,890
Daddy has little to give you.

1221
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:53,050
but if you manage

1222
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,700
your life will change

1223
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,450
Can.

1224
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,230
Get prepared.

1225
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:02,080
Camera, engine...

1226
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:04,490
And they started!

1227
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:07,660
For the sake of saving the country.

1228
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:09,310
I beg you emperor

1229
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,250
don't break your vows. Give people a chance.

1230
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,540
This is my last trick.

1231
01:38:58,150 --> 01:38:59,290
Last fight.

1232
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,560
It's not a double.

1233
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,630
A boy who wants to please his dad.

1234
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,740
And he gets hurt too.

1235
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,300
I'll help you.

1236
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:32,840
We train.

1237
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:39,130
What are you doing? Stop!

1238
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:40,490
Don't act like that.

1239
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:41,810
Keep calm.

1240
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,790
You may not use it for your own purposes.

1241
01:40:14,088 --> 01:40:15,954
Is complete? What have you got there?

1242
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:18,160
I am complete, I am complete.

1243
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,140
Baby.

1244
01:40:34,869 --> 01:40:35,869
I'm sorry.

1245
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,760
Maybe,

1246
01:40:41,743 --> 01:40:43,077
it's time to stop.

1247
01:40:46,842 --> 01:40:47,842
Cold.

1248
01:40:50,322 --> 01:40:51,322
We do not.

1249
01:40:53,292 --> 01:40:54,775
Hello Wei!
Goes.

1250
01:40:55,522 --> 01:40:56,829
Hello.
Hello.

1251
01:40:56,883 --> 01:40:57,883
Are you complete?

1252
01:40:57,912 --> 01:40:58,912
I'm sorry.

1253
01:40:58,992 --> 01:40:59,992
Can't.

1254
01:41:01,362 --> 01:41:02,362
Finish.

1255
01:41:03,202 --> 01:41:04,775
I'm sorry.
Trivia.

1256
01:41:05,082 --> 01:41:06,082
Don't worry.

1257
01:41:06,358 --> 01:41:07,358
I am happy.

1258
01:41:08,022 --> 01:41:09,672
I didn't think it would come to this.

1259
01:41:10,962 --> 01:41:11,962
deshonrado

1260
01:41:12,792 --> 01:41:13,792
It's easy to jump.

1261
01:41:14,052 --> 01:41:15,162
The landing is difficult.

1262
01:41:15,432 --> 01:41:16,432
You yourself spoke.

1263
01:41:16,902 --> 01:41:19,362
He shouldn't have made Firepaw do the trick.

1264
01:41:20,172 --> 01:41:22,602
I've been jumping and falling all my life.

1265
01:41:23,742 --> 01:41:29,442
But as I lay there, I realized for the first time that
the true stunt spirit is indestructible.

1266
01:41:31,482 --> 01:41:34,408
Friends and family are what you should cherish.

1267
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:38,412
Director Tang, I was blind. I'm sorry.

1268
01:41:38,742 --> 01:41:42,342
I admire your courage and resilience.
Thanks brother.

1269
01:41:42,762 --> 01:41:44,832
Thanks for giving me one last chance.

1270
01:41:45,582 --> 01:41:47,668
But maybe I am everything.

1271
01:41:49,032 --> 01:41:50,032
No, forget it.

1272
01:41:50,802 --> 01:41:52,122
I'm a stunt double.

1273
01:41:52,242 --> 01:41:54,702
A stuntman doesn't need a cartoon stuntman.

1274
01:41:56,185 --> 01:41:58,242
Come on. It's time to go home, Twinkle.

1275
01:41:59,982 --> 01:42:00,982
Was.

1276
01:42:01,182 --> 01:42:04,242
Thanks brothers! Thanks thanks. Thank you.

1277
01:42:15,492 --> 01:42:16,989
My sweet girl.

1278
01:42:17,562 --> 01:42:19,782
Dad learned to compromise.

1279
01:42:23,742 --> 01:42:26,172
I know you've been waiting too long for this.

1280
01:42:27,342 --> 01:42:28,342
I'm sorry.

1281
01:42:42,582 --> 01:42:43,582
Home?

1282
01:42:51,162 --> 01:42:55,632
There is an affidavit from Mr. C,
the former owner of Linlon.

1283
01:42:56,652 --> 01:43:01,618
It follows from them that Linlon was acquired
by Mr. Van in personal possession by

1284
01:43:01,643 --> 01:43:07,782
980 thousand. But due to a temporary
cash shortage, Mr. Wang made an advance

1285
01:43:07,782 --> 01:43:09,998
payment of the corporate account "LM".

1286
01:43:10,212 --> 01:43:11,982
However, three days later,

1287
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:14,562
March 16, 2015

1288
01:43:14,832 --> 01:43:18,762
the same amount was transferred from
Mr. Wang's personal bank account

1289
01:43:18,882 --> 01:43:20,142
to the corporate account "LM".

1290
01:43:21,042 --> 01:43:22,632
even if it's true

1291
01:43:22,812 --> 01:43:27,822
used a corporate account and did not
compensate the company for interest earned.

1292
01:43:29,082 --> 01:43:33,792
And the company files show that
the transfer paid the costs,

1293
01:43:34,362 --> 01:43:38,652
Associated with another horse
named Hurricane, not Linlon.

1294
01:43:39,822 --> 01:43:41,442
Mr. Wang's signature.

1295
01:43:43,332 --> 01:43:44,332
This is true?

1296
01:43:45,306 --> 01:43:46,509
It's just a mistake.

1297
01:43:46,533 --> 01:43:51,162
Please keep order.
Here is the accountant's certified statement.

1298
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,682
Confirm the existence of the translation.

1299
01:43:53,802 --> 01:43:55,002
You faked everything.

1300
01:43:56,472 --> 01:43:57,912
I warn you again.

1301
01:43:58,062 --> 01:44:00,072
The defense can continue.

1302
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:07,032
We can not give up.

1303
01:44:07,332 --> 01:44:09,005
We have no right. No!

1304
01:44:12,672 --> 01:44:13,672
Dad?

1305
01:44:21,912 --> 01:44:23,172
I didn't protect him.

1306
01:44:24,193 --> 01:44:25,432
He trusted me a lot.

1307
01:44:37,512 --> 01:44:39,102
Thank you.
Trust!

1308
01:44:39,612 --> 01:44:40,752
A trusted deal.

1309
01:44:41,142 --> 01:44:46,620
Article 311 - The goods are transferred to the ownership
of the buyer on the basis of an oral agreement.

1310
01:44:46,645 --> 01:44:49,578
In the case of Ogonyok, in all respects,
it corresponds to the article.

1311
01:44:49,865 --> 01:44:51,225
We have already lost.

1312
01:44:51,372 --> 01:44:52,372
It's all over.

1313
01:44:54,012 --> 01:44:55,672
Mister! Mr. Ho, stop!

1314
01:44:56,108 --> 01:44:57,108
Mr Ho!

1315
01:44:57,342 --> 01:45:01,190
Hear. Yes, we really lost.
But please don't destroy the family.

1316
01:45:01,215 --> 01:45:04,122
I have always believed that the law should be
harsh but fair.

1317
01:45:04,272 --> 01:45:05,802
Ogonyok was born sick.

1318
01:45:06,132 --> 01:45:07,132
and teacher lou

1319
01:45:07,272 --> 01:45:10,032
prevented him from being sacrificed. He saved him.

1320
01:45:10,872 --> 01:45:13,572
For you, it will be an exhibition, a toy.

1321
01:45:13,842 --> 01:45:16,465
And for Lou - a child, his son.

1322
01:45:16,932 --> 01:45:19,962
After all, you probably know the feeling
Master Lu is experiencing.

1323
01:45:21,522 --> 01:45:23,882
I assure you that we are fine

1324
01:45:24,132 --> 01:45:25,132
take care of the horse

1325
01:45:25,422 --> 01:45:27,982
And even better than Master Lu. He will get
stronger.

1326
01:45:28,152 --> 01:45:29,682
Well, we can too.
Hear.

1327
01:45:30,942 --> 01:45:33,402
We will not put you in danger.

1328
01:45:35,352 --> 01:45:36,942
I also love horses very much.

1329
01:45:37,662 --> 01:45:38,662
And I know them.

1330
01:45:39,062 --> 01:45:42,042
Trust me, Ogonyok will be much better with me.

1331
01:45:43,772 --> 01:45:45,038
Good luck.
Mr Ho!

1332
01:45:45,432 --> 01:45:46,432
Please.

1333
01:45:46,602 --> 01:45:49,242
You can't live without it.
Enough, finish it.

1334
01:46:02,862 --> 01:46:05,862
Why can't I
help the most defenseless?

1335
01:46:07,812 --> 01:46:09,192
You did everything you could.

1336
01:46:17,052 --> 01:46:18,052
Mister.

1337
01:46:19,482 --> 01:46:20,712
Everything we lost.

1338
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:22,092
It needs to be recognized.

1339
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:23,752
Head up.

1340
01:46:24,222 --> 01:46:26,502
No matter what, you can't hang your nose.

1341
01:46:28,392 --> 01:46:29,392
Excuse me sir.

1342
01:46:30,162 --> 01:46:31,542
I was too naive.

1343
01:46:32,892 --> 01:46:33,892
You were young.

1344
01:46:35,052 --> 01:46:36,052
Thank you.

1345
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:55,282
Baby.

1346
01:46:58,992 --> 01:46:59,992
Unfortunately,

1347
01:47:00,942 --> 01:47:01,942
it's all over.

1348
01:47:10,722 --> 01:47:11,722
Soon

1349
01:47:11,952 --> 01:47:13,812
Dad can't take care of you.

1350
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:19,355
Come here.

1351
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:29,052
Remember what I tell you.

1352
01:47:31,212 --> 01:47:32,212
You are the best.

1353
01:47:36,402 --> 01:47:37,452
You will go far.

1354
01:47:38,442 --> 01:47:39,442
Head up.

1355
01:47:48,942 --> 01:47:50,052
Everything will be fine.

1356
01:47:55,002 --> 01:47:56,002
Light.

1357
01:48:18,882 --> 01:48:19,882
Want

1358
01:48:22,092 --> 01:48:23,382
last workout?

1359
01:48:28,992 --> 01:48:29,992
Cold.

1360
01:48:39,492 --> 01:48:40,492
Idiot.

1361
01:48:41,292 --> 01:48:42,292
Dodge.

1362
01:48:43,452 --> 01:48:44,622
if they hit you

1363
01:48:45,822 --> 01:48:46,822
Dodge.

1364
01:48:48,552 --> 01:48:49,552
Again.

1365
01:49:14,232 --> 01:49:15,372
future owner

1366
01:49:16,962 --> 01:49:18,912
will not praise you like a father.

1367
01:49:20,622 --> 01:49:21,622
Stay strong.

1368
01:49:22,512 --> 01:49:23,512
Do you understand?

1369
01:49:24,462 --> 01:49:25,462
you are an adult

1370
01:49:27,072 --> 01:49:29,112
You must be able to protect yourself.

1371
01:49:30,951 --> 01:49:34,122
Whatever you face, take a hit.

1372
01:49:35,382 --> 01:49:37,156
And don't forget about your dad.

1373
01:49:39,882 --> 01:49:40,882
I'm sorry.

1374
01:49:43,743 --> 01:49:45,048
It's dad's fault.

1375
01:49:45,072 --> 01:49:47,238
I didn't protect you.

1376
01:50:42,072 --> 01:50:43,072
Light.

1377
01:50:43,962 --> 01:50:44,962
be young

1378
01:50:49,658 --> 01:50:50,658
We have arrived.

1379
01:50:50,888 --> 01:50:51,888
Disengage.

1380
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:58,243
Scintillation.

1381
01:50:58,268 --> 01:50:59,268
Come on.

1382
01:51:11,078 --> 01:51:12,078
Nothing.

1383
01:52:26,138 --> 01:52:27,138
be young

1384
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:35,310
It has character.

1385
01:52:36,518 --> 01:52:37,598
Please do not hit me.

1386
01:52:42,668 --> 01:52:43,838
He has weak lungs.

1387
01:52:44,813 --> 01:52:46,068
He is often sick.

1388
01:52:48,038 --> 01:52:49,038
Thank you.

1389
01:53:07,358 --> 01:53:08,358
Go.
Sir.

1390
01:53:09,638 --> 01:53:10,638
Edema.

1391
01:53:13,448 --> 01:53:14,448
Light.

1392
01:53:14,528 --> 01:53:15,528
Do not be afraid.

1393
01:53:20,678 --> 01:53:21,678
Factory.

1394
01:53:44,198 --> 01:53:45,198
Let it run.

1395
01:53:50,768 --> 01:53:51,768
Light.

1396
01:54:09,315 --> 01:54:10,315
Dad!

1397
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:30,625
Stay.

1398
01:54:40,148 --> 01:54:41,148
Who called you?

1399
01:54:45,638 --> 01:54:46,638
Leave.

1400
01:54:52,538 --> 01:54:53,538
Go out.

1401
01:54:56,708 --> 01:54:57,708
Leave.

1402
01:54:59,558 --> 01:55:01,178
come back, get out

1403
01:55:06,758 --> 01:55:08,288
I do not need you anymore.

1404
01:56:17,648 --> 01:56:18,908
Let me remind myself.

1405
01:56:19,698 --> 01:56:23,978
I'm Mickey Luo. Due to university rules,

1406
01:56:24,458 --> 01:56:25,868
I can't represent you.

1407
01:56:26,318 --> 01:56:27,318
But...

1408
01:56:27,878 --> 01:56:29,078
I can and want to help.

1409
01:56:33,848 --> 01:56:35,528
Beware of the angry horse.

1410
01:56:39,218 --> 01:56:40,928
The bad horse no longer exists.

1411
01:56:53,108 --> 01:56:54,398
My father is a dreamer.

1412
01:56:55,598 --> 01:56:57,578
Their love is a passionate struggle.

1413
01:56:59,048 --> 01:57:02,408
This applies to work,
to me, and, of course, to Ogonyok.

1414
01:57:03,871 --> 01:57:05,678
His love is incomparable.

1415
01:57:06,608 --> 01:57:09,068
He lost half his life for the love of work.

1416
01:57:10,358 --> 01:57:12,998
Have mercy, do not deprive him of at least
one friend.

1417
01:58:20,565 --> 01:58:22,118
Let me sleep a little more.

1418
01:58:32,268 --> 01:58:33,268
Scintillation?

1419
01:58:37,208 --> 01:58:38,208
Fire...

1420
01:58:40,622 --> 01:58:41,622
Scintillation.

1421
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:44,960
It's you?

1422
01:58:46,215 --> 01:58:47,958
Scintillation. I missed you a lot.

1423
01:58:48,015 --> 01:58:49,241
How did you get here?

1424
01:58:50,198 --> 01:58:51,308
Did you run away yourself?

1425
01:58:55,431 --> 01:58:57,138
As? How did you come back?

1426
01:59:03,518 --> 01:59:05,348
I promise not to leave you again.

1427
01:59:05,858 --> 01:59:06,998
Never again.

1428
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:10,238
Your house has not changed. See?

1429
01:59:10,748 --> 01:59:12,861
Everything is in its place, even the straw. See?

1430
01:59:13,478 --> 01:59:14,478
Look.

1431
01:59:15,034 --> 01:59:16,928
Here, everything is in its place.
Thank you.

1432
01:59:17,648 --> 01:59:19,718
even if you didn't come

1433
01:59:19,838 --> 01:59:22,028
He would still soon return the Fire.

1434
01:59:23,011 --> 01:59:24,211
Because?

1435
01:59:26,234 --> 01:59:27,878
He refused the food.

1436
01:59:28,368 --> 01:59:29,484
We will have everything as before.

1437
01:59:30,121 --> 01:59:31,121
small fire.

1438
01:59:32,348 --> 01:59:33,848
fire, no. Get up!

1439
01:59:34,388 --> 01:59:35,388
There is no need.

1440
01:59:35,738 --> 01:59:36,788
Do not do it anymore.

1441
01:59:37,478 --> 01:59:38,708
I know horses.

1442
01:59:39,128 --> 01:59:40,508
and i never saw

1443
01:59:40,808 --> 01:59:43,388
such readiness for
self-sacrifice,

1444
01:59:44,048 --> 01:59:45,068
Like the fire.

1445
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:47,238
My baby.

1446
01:59:47,378 --> 01:59:49,951
Now you're going to take your dad everywhere, right?

1447
01:59:50,558 --> 01:59:53,858
You showed me teacher Lou's notes and I realized

1448
01:59:53,978 --> 01:59:55,268
how similar they are

1449
01:59:56,318 --> 01:59:58,778
Both are willing to sacrifice their lives.

1450
01:59:59,048 --> 02:00:00,068
for love.

1451
02:00:03,008 --> 02:00:04,628
He is also a student of a kung fu master.

1452
02:00:05,318 --> 02:00:06,668
Kung fu masters?

1453
02:00:10,358 --> 02:00:11,468
Already impressed.

1454
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:25,598
Dad!
Mister.

1455
02:00:29,356 --> 02:00:30,943
Children, thank you.

1456
02:00:30,968 --> 02:00:32,858
Thank you thank you thank you.

1457
02:00:33,248 --> 02:00:34,248
Thank you.

1458
02:00:45,878 --> 02:00:49,598
The film is dedicated to stuntmen,
kung fu masters, stuntmen,

1459
02:00:49,778 --> 02:00:51,788
and also to all those who stayed behind the scenes.

1460
02:00:51,998 --> 02:00:55,838
But it contributed to the centuries-old history
of Chinese cinema.

1461
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:58,396
A Larry Yan film

1462
02:01:00,130 --> 02:01:01,655
Engine! we started.

1463
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,960
So clear. Another double.

1464
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:06,110
WELL WELL.

1465
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,520
I agree,

1466
02:01:07,759 --> 02:01:08,925
but listen

1467
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:11,290
Did you notice that I was moving sideways?
She observed.

1468
02:01:11,416 --> 02:01:12,963
And the camera is there.

1469
02:01:13,357 --> 02:01:15,037
I have to get into the frame.

1470
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:16,250
Specialist

1471
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:19,060
You should always be able to keep up the frenzy.

1472
02:01:19,293 --> 02:01:20,293
That?
Understood?

1473
02:01:20,327 --> 02:01:21,327
Understood. Hit.

1474
02:01:21,567 --> 02:01:22,607
Blow... blow.

1475
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,910
Maybe we'd better discuss the lawsuit?
Come on.

1476
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:26,570
Now.

1477
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:30,593
I can not anymore

1478
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:32,950
Again.
Give me a second.

1479
02:01:33,108 --> 02:01:34,306
I can't do it right away.

1480
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:35,330
Help him up.

1481
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:38,030
Hold him.

1482
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:43,766
...of buildings, through glass and over stoves.

1483
02:01:43,870 --> 02:01:45,940
What other dish? To the kitchen?

1484
02:01:47,063 --> 02:01:48,308
Well, it's also open.

1485
02:01:48,333 --> 02:01:50,050
No, they don't install them.

1486
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:53,388
Okay, I understand, but I...

1487
02:01:54,388 --> 02:01:55,388
I jump.

1488
02:01:57,787 --> 02:02:02,540
Well, I jump off the building through the glass and fall into
the fire.

1489
02:02:03,593 --> 02:02:04,793
What are you doing?

1490
02:02:11,213 --> 02:02:12,213
come on

1491
02:02:17,912 --> 02:02:18,912
Are you capricious?

1492
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:21,497
Why are you so selfish?

1493
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:22,630
If it doesn't fall...

1494
02:02:24,227 --> 02:02:25,587
If I don't fall...

1495
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:27,450
If I don't fall...

1496
02:02:27,757 --> 02:02:29,437
If I don't fall, oh, that's all.

1497
02:02:29,462 --> 02:02:30,722
Take it away!
That?

1498
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:33,700
We're not done! I didn't get to say
a word!

1499
02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:35,680
Came back. Escape! Again.

1500
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:37,520
Come on, I'll serve you.

1501
02:02:40,544 --> 02:02:41,544
He is good.

1502
02:02:42,027 --> 02:02:43,027
I still have.

1503
02:02:51,823 --> 02:02:52,823
He is good.

1504
02:02:53,470 --> 02:02:54,470
Nothing, there's more.

1505
02:02:56,183 --> 02:02:57,220
And he is good.

1506
02:02:57,490 --> 02:02:58,490
Now pour.

1507
02:02:58,730 --> 02:02:59,800
And I still have.

1508
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:00,980
come on

1509
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,416
We laugh, we laugh. More active.

1510
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,610
Yes, thanks.

1511
02:03:18,036 --> 02:03:19,036
Again.

1512
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:21,440
come on

1513
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:30,460
Well done Jackie! Super.

1514
02:03:30,743 --> 02:03:33,810
Here it is applauded, but for me this is something common.

1515
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,940
Come on!

1516
02:03:44,535 --> 02:03:45,535
Taken!

1517
02:03:55,581 --> 02:03:56,581
Here is a nail.

1518
02:03:56,770 --> 02:03:57,880
Pull out the nail.

1519
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:08,230
More more! Fall!

1520
02:04:12,335 --> 02:04:13,375
I am complete, I am complete.

1521
02:04:23,737 --> 02:04:24,857
How strong

1522
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:36,620
