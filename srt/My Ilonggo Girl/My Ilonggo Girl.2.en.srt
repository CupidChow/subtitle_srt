1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,867
I'm still watching
Venice Hermoso.

2
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:06,600
The actress who looks exactly
like Tata.

3
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:07,933
I have an idea!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,633
Is that Venice?

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,867
The actress?

6
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,300
I heard your restaurant
was crowded.

7
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:17,067
Tata copied Venice so well.

8
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:20,667
Based on the tests, she has
stage 5 chronic kidney disease.

9
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,300
We'll be in debt
when I go on dialysis.

10
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:24,900
We can find a way.

11
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,533
You never wanted this to happen.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,133
Don't think that
you're a burden.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,167
Francis is madly
in love with you.

14
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:35,767
Heir to the fortune
of the Palma family.

15
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,267
Don't call or text.

16
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,033
Okay?

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,333
I don't want to get caught.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,000
Just give Francis an excuse.

19
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,700
Then go and see me.

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,433
Mister, may I use the restroom?

21
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:49,567
Yes, you may, Ma'am.
It's over there.

22
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,333
Thank you.

23
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:53,500
My gosh!

24
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,333
Venice, I've been waiting
for you.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Go and talk to your husband.

26
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,167
Hurry up, come on.
Wait!

27
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:00,700
Wait!
Ouch.

28
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,267
Venice, let's talk.

29
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,033
Please, let's fix this.

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,367
Sir, I'm not Venice.

31
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,233
I'm not your wife.

32
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,733
We just look alike.

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
Is everything clear to you, Sir?

34
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:13,633
I'm not Venice.

35
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,733
I'm Tata.

36
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,233
Excuse me, Sir.
I need to go pee.

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,100
Why can't I open it?

38
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,067
Joana, let us out!

39
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,267
This is a window, right?

40
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,100
Yes.
Why?

41
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,933
I'll just climb up.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,167
I'll go out from there.
I really need to pee.

43
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,300
Wait, Miss.
That's too high.

44
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:29,733
You might fall.

45
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:30,767
What?
This isn't high.

46
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:32,633
What the heck!

47
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,800
Careful, you might fall.

48
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,100
No, I can do this.
Chill.

49
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,100
You're overreacting.

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,067
I climb mango trees.

51
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,133
This is a piece of cake.

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,900
Don't you climb
a mango tree?

53
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,733
I can do this.

54
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,667
Oh!

55
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,500
Who is that woman you locked

56
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,967
with my husband
in the stockroom?

57
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,400
Oh my goodness!

58
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,033
It's you!

59
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,433
What did you do with my husband?

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,933
Nothing.
First, you copied me.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,467
You copied my face
and made money off of me.

62
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,867
And now you're seducing
my husband?

63
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,067
I'm going to sue you.

64
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,633
- Slut.
- Venice, stop!

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,400
Stop it.

66
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,400
- Why?
- Venice, that's enough.

67
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,867
Venice, please stop.

68
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,500
Stop.

69
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,000
Hey, stop!

70
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,867
- Stop it.
- Stop, please.

71
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,267
Tata, what did they do to you?

72
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,633
Miss, I'm really sorry
for this misunderstanding.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:30,167
Wait.

75
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,467
Why are you apologizing?

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,933
Who hurt you?

77
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,900
Who did that to you?

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,933
- I'm going to hit you!
- Wait.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,900
How dare you?

80
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,833
Watch your mouth!

81
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,433
Well, obviously, you grew up
on the street.

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,800
So you don't know what we
could do to people like you!

83
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,867
Just so you know,
your friend did me wrong!

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,367
And you...

85
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,833
you should learn your lesson!

86
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,600
Please stop copying me,

87
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,333
whatever the hell your name is!

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,967
Venice.

89
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,167
Venice, that's enough.

90
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,133
It was my mistake.

91
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,533
I thought she was you.

92
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,100
Miss...

93
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,933
Look, I'm really sorry
for what happened.

94
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,067
Please, I'll get my
staff to bring you home.

95
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,267
Jampol, let's go.

96
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,400
I don't want any more trouble.

97
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,033
Let's go.

98
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:50,800
What?

99
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,200
Babe.

100
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:01,967
Babe, come here.

101
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:03,567
Babe.

102
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:13,033
I knew you couldn't
say no to me.

103
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:17,933
Where's your security?

104
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,367
I escaped them.

105
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm tired of Francis, Babe.

106
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,800
I don't want to be with
that man anymore.

107
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,233
Babe, don't worry.

108
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,433
I got you.

109
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:37,833
I miss you.

110
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,067
What's that?

111
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,667
From now on...

112
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,333
you don't need this.

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,300
Okay?

114
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:24,133
Hello, Peter?

115
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,067
Where are you?

116
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,500
Can you come here now?

117
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,300
Okay, bye.

118
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,600
Peter, can you book me tickets
to Bali next week?

119
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:43,433
For two.

120
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,633
For me and Venice.

121
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,567
Yes, Sir James.

122
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:47,700
You can go.

123
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,133
Love, I don't understand you
anymore.

124
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
Why did you hurt
the woman earlier?

125
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,567
And the other day, you also hurt
your assistant.

126
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,400
Why do you take their side?

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,633
They did me wrong, remember?

128
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,000
They deserved what
I did to them.

129
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:18,933
Venice.

130
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,700
What I'm trying to say
is that you've changed a lot.

131
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,333
It seems that
I don't know you anymore.

132
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,567
Look, we're just lucky that
we can control the press.

133
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:33,333
But mom and dad are already
coming home from the States.

134
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,433
What will they say if
they hear about it?

135
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,400
See?

136
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,533
That's all you care about.

137
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,467
You care more about
what your parents will say!

138
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:45,633
Over me!

139
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,733
I'm your wife, Francis,
in case you forget!

140
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,800
We both know what's at
stake here, Venice.

141
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,867
You know how important
my family's reputation

142
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,500
is to my parents and, of course,
to this business.

143
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,867
I just want you to be on their
good side.

144
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,733
I don't want my parents to say
anything bad about you.

145
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,633
Well, guess what?

146
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,433
I don't care anymore!

147
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,933
They always have something to
say about me, right?

148
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:18,567
Love.

149
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,167
Let's not argue here.

150
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,867
Julius is here.

151
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,400
You know that he has a problem.

152
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,267
So it's me who's going
to adjust again.

153
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,267
This mansion is suffocating me,
Francis.

154
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,233
I'm tired of trying to impress
your family every single day!

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,967
In the first place, they don't
want us to get married.

156
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,667
Because they don't want
me to have your name!

157
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Nanny Nora!

158
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,633
Please get Julius' favorite toy.

159
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,367
Give it to him.

160
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,800
- Hurry!
- Okay, Sir.

161
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,900
Julius, it's okay.

162
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,300
Calm down, Julius.

163
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,100
Butterfly hug, butterfly hug.

164
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,800
This is tiring, Francis!

165
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,233
I'm tired of you all!

166
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,667
I'm tired of this boring
and miserable marriage!

167
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,067
Venice.

168
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,500
Venice.

169
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,267
Venice, wait.

170
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:51,400
Here.

171
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,567
Here's your favorite.

172
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:53,300
Don't cry.
Don't cry.

173
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,233
Don't cry.

174
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,200
Don't cry, don't cry.

175
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,733
It's okay, it's okay.

176
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,833
It's okay.

177
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,700
Inhale, exhale.

178
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:14,833
There.

179
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,833
I didn't know
Venice was so mean!

180
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,367
She's such a snob!

181
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,833
Maybe she's always been
like that.

182
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:25,900
And she got married to Francis.

183
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:29,000
The Palmas are the richest here
in Iloilo, aren't they?

184
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,733
If I were there, I would
probably hit Francis.

185
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,400
Imagine?

186
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,433
He didn't even comfort you
in front of his wife.

187
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,133
Isn't that how the rich
really are?

188
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,267
They look down on
poor people too much.

189
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,500
It was terrible earlier.

190
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,333
Tata and I were like insects
in front of them.

191
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,633
Leave them be.

192
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,367
Venice was right.

193
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,867
I should stop copying her
before something bad happens.

194
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,100
You're too kind, Tata.

195
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,833
You're like a protagonist
in a drama series.

196
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,033
There's no such thing.

197
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,500
Martyr?

198
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,967
That's not the trend anymore.

199
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:10,967
So what if you copy her?

200
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,667
Will that make her poor?

201
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,000
Hey, hey, hey.

202
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,300
Maymay, you're so blunt.

203
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,100
You shouldn't feel guilty
about it, Tata.

204
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,833
You just sang and danced.

205
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,867
What's wrong with that?

206
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,700
I want to hit the roof
of her mouth.

207
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,400
Let's leave everything to God.

208
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:35,600
I won't see Venice
and the Palmas anymore, anyway.

209
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:38,967
Don't cry.

210
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,767
You're beautiful.

211
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,400
Babe.
Babe.

212
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,033
Missed you.

213
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,200
I missed you, too.

214
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,200
Babe, I told you.

215
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,733
Come with me to Bali, okay?

216
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,267
I promise you,

217
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,900
no one will find us
in Indonesia.

218
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,333
It's just you and me.

219
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:48,433
James, you know
I can't just leave.

220
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,267
Babe.

221
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,233
Mom!

222
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,133
- Come here.
- Mommy!

223
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,867
- Venice, Babe...
- I said come here!

224
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:30,700
Mommy.

225
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:33,400
Come here.

226
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,400
I knew it.

227
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,900
You're hiding something
from me, Venice.

228
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,367
How could you do this
to Francis?

229
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,467
How did you manage to flirt?

230
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,433
You're married!

231
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,333
Mommy!

232
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,233
You know I don't love Francis.

233
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,900
I tried, but I really can't.

234
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:56,867
Venice.

235
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,367
Mom, I'm so tired of him.

236
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,200
I'm so tired of his family.

237
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,300
Wait!

238
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,067
- Don't hurt your daughter.
- You, too!

239
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,467
- Mommy!
- Stay out of this!

240
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,767
Stay away from my daughter!

241
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:15,800
You...
Mommy.

242
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,833
You will never meet

243
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,267
- with him again.
- Mommy, please.

244
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,300
Come with me!

245
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,367
Please stop!

246
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,867
Stop this!

247
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,967
Venice, come with me.

248
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,867
Please, Mom, I'm tired!

249
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,267
Stop this!

250
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:36,800
You will never meet
this man again.

251
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,267
You won't waste all our
hard work, Venice.

252
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,233
And Francis shouldn't know this.

253
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:51,067
You are going to stop this
insanity right now!

254
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,433
You hear me? And you're
coming with me.

255
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,167
Venice.
Venice, I love you so much!

256
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,833
- Mommy!
- Stay away!

257
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,000
- Stay away!
- Venice!

258
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,033
- I said stay away!
- Babe! Babe!

259
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,133
- Mom!
- Come with me!

260
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,800
- I love you so much, Venice!
- Please, stop!

261
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:00,633
Bring her car home.

262
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,033
Get in the car.

263
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,600
Get in the car!

264
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,633
Venice!

265
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:12,367
Go!

266
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,667
Dear.

267
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,767
Can I have a taste
of your cooking?

268
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,733
Oh, Sweetie.

269
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,000
You're the only one who can
imitate your grandma's cooking.

270
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,067
Among your siblings...

271
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,467
you're the only one
who can do it.

272
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
But you're still
a better cook, Mom.

273
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,433
You're the original gwapa ,
remember?

274
00:17:59,067 --> 00:17:59,900
And...

275
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,200
you're the one who taught me
how to cook this.

276
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,033
Dear...

277
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:08,933
why are you stupefied?

278
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,733
Look at what you're cooking.

279
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,733
It might spill.

280
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,300
Is there a problem?

281
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,067
Why is this happening to us?

282
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,700
We don't take advantage
of other people.

283
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,633
We fight fairly in life.

284
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,933
But you ended up sick.

285
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,567
Dear, God always
has his reasons.

286
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,467
Sometimes, we just don't
understand.

287
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
Because we're just humans.

288
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,633
But he won't give us anything
we can't handle.

289
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
Can I have a hug, Mom?

290
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,767
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,967
I got discouraged.

292
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,300
But Maymay was right.

293
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,000
I should fight.

294
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,300
We went through a lot, right?

295
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:30,300
When dad left us for another
woman back in Manila.

296
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,433
You supported us.

297
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,900
So now, Mom, I want to do
the same thing.

298
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,467
I promise you.

299
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,733
I will do everything for you
to get better.

300
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:50,733
As grandmother said,
we are Ilonggos.

301
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,700
We have an Ilonggo heart.

302
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,533
And an Ilonggo always put up
a good fight.

303
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,067
Can I have a hug, Dear?

304
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,767
I love you, Mom.

305
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:35,767
Come with me to Bali, okay?

306
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,533
I promise you.

307
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,700
No one can find us in Indonesia.

308
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,700
It's just you and me.

309
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,800
What happened?

310
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,633
Why are Ma'am Vivian and her
daughter here so early?

311
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,967
They don't usually
come here early.

312
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Vilma, here's the tea.

313
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,367
I heard that Ma'am Venice
left the house this morning.

314
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:57,600
She brought her stuff, but
not confirmed.

315
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,300
You're so into it, aren't you?

316
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,000
And I listened with enthusiasm.

317
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,133
That's how you are.

318
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,667
You love gossiping.

319
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:07,467
You're like a CCTV.

320
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,733
You capture everything.

321
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,733
Her ears are very sharp.

322
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,933
She might hear you.

323
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,367
Go water the plants.

324
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,233
Your mouth always works.

325
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:42,533
Francis, what do you mean
my daughter left?

326
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:44,967
Where would she go?

327
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:54,467
Francis, maybe she just went
to her friends like last time.

328
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,300
Yes.

329
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,000
Not this time.

330
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,667
This time it's different.

331
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:15,967
She left this
before she left the house.

332
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,233
What do you mean? What's this?

333
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,167
What's happening, Mom?

334
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,933
Francis, if you're
watching this...

335
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:48,333
it's over.

336
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm done with this marriage.

337
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:55,167
So don't look for me
because I will never come back.

338
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:58,567
- Oh, Venice.
- Mom!

339
00:24:58,633 --> 00:24:59,733
Mom, Mom.

340
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,400
Mom.

341
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,800
Are you okay, Mom?

342
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,133
Mom, Mom.

343
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:09,733
Mom.

344
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,200
You are Venice's stylist, right?

345
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:50,367
I want you to make Venice
look like a fool

346
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:53,967
in front of everyone, most
especially her husband.

347
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,733
That woman did me wrong.

348
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,767
I worked so hard to get Venice
married to Francis.

349
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:03,167
So, if you need to
drag your sister

350
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,200
back into the country,
do it!

351
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,467
Oh, my God!

352
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,400
You really are Venice.

353
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,333
You want me to pretend
to be Ma'am Venice?
