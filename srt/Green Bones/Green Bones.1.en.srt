1
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,125
<i>I've long heard about the stories.</i>

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,541
<i>There's a reason</i>
<i>why they call him Crazy Dom.</i>

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,166
<i>After killing his sister and his niece,</i>

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,791
<i>he was found on a bridge,</i>

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,958
<i>deranged.</i>

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,375
<i>He dumped the child's body there.</i>

7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,750
<i>The little girl was Deaf,</i>

8
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:42,583
<i>and some say Dom was too.</i>

9
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,750
<i>In those final moments,</i>

10
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,875
<i>he left a threat</i>
<i>to those who captured him.</i>

11
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,958
<i>"I'll get back at you.”</i>

12
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,833
<i>Zamora was never charged</i>

13
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:41,333
<i>for the disappearance</i>
<i>of his niece, Ruth Anne Pineda.</i>

14
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:45,875
<i>Her body was never recovered</i>
<i>from the river…</i>

15
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:49,875
<i>The Bureau of Reforms is now decongesting</i>
<i>correctional facilities.</i>

16
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,000
<i>Notorious convict,</i>
<i>Domingo Zamora is among those…</i>

17
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:57,125
<i>…Domingo Zamora will be sent</i>
<i>to San Fabian Prison and Penal Farm,</i>

18
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:01,541
<i>the largest prison island</i>
<i>outside Metro Manila.</i>

19
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,416
<i>Only two kinds of people</i>
<i>live in the world.</i>

20
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:11,125
<i>The good ones, and the bad.</i>

21
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,291
<i>I learned this early.</i>

22
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,666
<i>When my sister died</i>

23
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,750
<i>at the hands of a criminal.</i>

24
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,208
<i>I promised myself that one day,</i>

25
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,416
<i>I will stand guard between evil-doers</i>

26
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,958
<i>and those they would harm.</i>

27
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,166
<i>That day,</i>

28
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,833
<i>I fulfilled my promise.</i>

29
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,250
<i>I made it to San Fabian.</i>

30
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,875
All right.

31
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,625
Good morning, sir.

32
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,375
I'm CO Xavier Gonzaga, ma'am.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,041
CO Reyes. Just call me Mi.

34
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,291
Let's go.

35
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,708
Come on.

36
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,375
Are they all prisoners?

37
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,750
Yellow for medium security.

38
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,125
But most are green, minimum.

39
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,958
Many are waiting to be released.

40
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,416
<i>This was less than a prison.</i>

41
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,500
<i>What I saw was a taste of freedom.</i>

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
That's nothing.

43
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,000
Come on, man!
Want to fight now?

44
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,375
- You think highly of yourself!
- So, what?

45
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,375
Stop it!

46
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,458
You can't beat me!

47
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,541
<i>Least of all,</i>

48
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,750
<i>I did not expect to see him</i>
<i>in minimum security.</i>

49
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,708
<i>Crazy Dom.</i>

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,708
<i>Even inside, he used a different language.</i>

51
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,250
Prof!

52
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,625
Gonzaga!

53
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,291
Finally!

54
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,666
Now what did I tell you?

55
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,791
I'll make it eventually, Prof.

56
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,958
I'm not exactly "Prof" in here.

57
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,500
Superintendent, sir.

58
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,083
I was so happy when you told me

59
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,083
that you finished the course.

60
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,166
Did it take you five years?

61
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,916
More than five, sir.

62
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,833
Don't be embarrassed.

63
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,458
What's important is you carried on,

64
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,333
finished Criminology and now, you're here.

65
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,166
Thank you for the opportunity.

66
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,791
<i>There is a belief</i>

67
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:08,791
<i>that finding green bones</i>
<i>in a person's remains</i>

68
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,541
<i>is proof of</i>
<i>that person's goodness in life.</i>

69
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,041
<i>But there are no green bones</i>
<i>in this place.</i>

70
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,958
<i>Only one person I know is good</i>

71
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,875
<i>to the core.</i>

72
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,583
<i>They told me</i>

73
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,125
<i>they found green bones</i>
<i>in my sister's ashes.</i>

74
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,750
<i>A proof that Elise was a good one.</i>

75
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,375
<i>But I already knew that.</i>

76
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,791
- Sup.
- Cruz.

77
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,958
This is Lt. Jonathan Cruz, head guard.

78
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,500
This is Gonzaga.

79
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,458
He was a student of mine.

80
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,583
Sir.

81
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,083
Did you come from Central, too?

82
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,958
I don't remember seeing you there.

83
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,875
No, sir.

84
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,583
This is my first assignment.

85
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,250
Sup, this one will have a hard time
with the inmates.

86
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,208
I'll assign him to guest relations.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can do it, sir.

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,208
That's the attitude.

89
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,666
You see that, Cruz?

90
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,416
Sir, with all due respect--

91
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,041
All hands on deck, Cruz.

92
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,125
We're releasing some prisoners

93
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,958
and taking in transferees from Central.

94
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,458
You'll need him.

95
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,041
FRESH OUT OF JAIL

96
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,458
COMFORTABLE LIFE OUTSIDE

97
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,041
SLIPPERS

98
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,750
BABY'S MILK AND DIAPERS

99
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,625
Sir, what's this?

100
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,166
It holds the prisoners' small wishes.

101
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,666
That was a program
of the old superintendent,

102
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,375
Delos Santos.

103
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,458
He died this year,

104
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,500
so I had to move here from Central.

105
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,750
Cruz, too.

106
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,583
Delos Santos believed in rehabilitation,

107
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,833
not just punishment.

108
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,583
Many were released on good conduct

109
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,625
during his time.

110
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,791
This is not the prison you expected.

111
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,333
Sir, can I ask?

112
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,250
How can you tell
if a criminal has changed?

113
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,875
What if their case was murder?

114
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,875
Gonzaga, it's not in our oath

115
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,625
to question superiors.

116
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,125
Don't you understand that?

117
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,625
Nothing wrong with asking questions, Cruz.

118
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,083
You can do the headcount.

119
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,458
Here.

120
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,208
There are PDLs that could be released

121
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,750
in the next few months.

122
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,250
The last recommendation from Delos Santos.

123
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,458
Study each one.

124
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,250
There should be no violations

125
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,125
until the decision is handed down.

126
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,708
Let's help them.

127
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,583
Who knows?

128
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,583
You might find your answers.

129
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,833
Thank you, sir.

130
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,041
<i>How many of them have really changed?</i>

131
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>Luis and Minyong.</i>

132
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,666
<i>Lovers.</i>

133
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,083
<i>They killed Luis' uncle</i>

134
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,958
<i>with a hammer.</i>

135
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,833
<i>Ador.</i>

136
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,458
<i>Pusher.</i>

137
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,208
<i>Once a pusher,</i>

138
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,291
<i>always a pusher.</i>

139
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:28,875
<i>Gardo.</i>

140
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,250
<i>He took a security guard's gun</i>

141
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,750
<i>and killed his manager at a fast food.</i>

142
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,000
<i>Pol.</i>

143
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,583
<i>He was cheated at a cockfight,</i>

144
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,041
<i>so he killed the rooster.</i>

145
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,041
<i>Then he killed the owner.</i>

146
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,416
<i>Change?</i>

147
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,833
<i>In just one snap,</i>

148
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,125
<i>they'll strike again.</i>

149
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,541
<i>The worst of them all</i>

150
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,541
<i>is Domingo Zamora.</i>

151
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,916
<i>Addict.</i>

152
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,208
<i>Murdered his sister</i>

153
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,458
<i>and niece in cold blood.</i>

154
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>What kind of monster kills his own family?</i>

155
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,291
Headcount!

156
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:25,958
One, two, three, four, five…

157
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,958
Did you even shower, Gardo?

158
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,291
Yesterday, boss.

159
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,458
You smell like a cat.

160
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,500
Take a bath!

161
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,333
Yes, sir.

162
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,500
Every two hours…

163
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,791
Headcount!

164
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,250
Hey, hurry up!

165
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,250
<i>…headcount.</i>

166
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,375
Headcount!

167
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,791
<i>They should be complete.</i>

168
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,125
Headcount!

169
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,916
Look at these fools. Think they're angels?

170
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,291
<i>They're only after attendance.</i>

171
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,791
Headcount!

172
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,625
<i>If you complete it in a month,</i>

173
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,166
<i>that's one day off your sentence.</i>

174
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,750
<i>There is no mention of deafness</i>
<i>in Zamora's records.</i>

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,916
<i>The word is that</i>
<i>he was tortured at Central</i>

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,666
- <i>and lost the ability to speak.</i>
- Headcount!

177
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,791
<i>Others say</i>

178
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,875
<i>it runs in the family.</i>

179
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,833
Should we tell him?

180
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,041
Don't babble! You'll ruin it.

181
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,416
<i>The prisoners have one routine.</i>

182
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,416
<i>6 a.m., gardening.</i>

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,166
<i>8 a.m., woodworks.</i>

184
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,416
<i>10 a.m., cooking.</i>

185
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,333
<i>12 p.m., lunch break.</i>

186
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,208
<i>But there is a critical time each day</i>

187
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,875
<i>when the gates are opened</i>

188
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,416
<i>to let the prisoners out.</i>

189
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,250
<i>No walls,</i>

190
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,208
<i>no steel bars stand</i>
<i>between them and freedom.</i>

191
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,166
<i>Only our eyes stop them.</i>

192
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,375
This is what you call,

193
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,666
"fetch and return.”

194
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,875
Some work in fishponds,

195
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,708
some in construction,

196
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,250
most work in farms.

197
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,875
Where's Zamora heading?

198
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,375
He's just off to their hut over there,

199
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,791
the souvenir shop for handicrafts.

200
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,000
They sell to the locals,

201
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,666
but their livelihood really comes
from the tourists.

202
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,708
And they just come back on their own?

203
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,125
Once you've caged an animal long enough,

204
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,416
it won't escape that easily.

205
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,250
<i>But at night,</i>

206
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,250
<i>Domingo Zamora does something</i>

207
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:17,541
<i>I never observed from any other prisoner.</i>

208
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,166
Zamora!

209
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,583
<i>Lights off!</i>

210
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,166
It's time to sleep.

211
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,708
<i>I will get back at you.</i>

212
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:05,333
<i>He's still repeating his threat.</i>

213
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,083
<i>Just biding his time.</i>

214
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,250
Sevilla Edgardo!

215
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,916
Just because you're old, you get to go?

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,333
You take care there.

217
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,291
And I'm taking Kitten along!

218
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,416
Hold it.

219
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,625
Property of San Fabian.

220
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,208
You can't take it out.

221
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,208
But I took care of him
since he was a baby!

222
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,958
Where was it born?

223
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,375
<i>He can hear.</i>

224
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,208
<i>But why won't he speak?</i>

225
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,333
Ador, let's send Mang Gardo off.

226
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,375
Conjugal visits are only until 3 p.m.

227
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,916
You better hurry!

228
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,791
Domingo Zamora, please.

229
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,916
- Who?
- Domingo Zamora.

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,375
Write it down.

231
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,500
Sign here.

232
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,791
Where? This one?

233
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,833
Who was that?

234
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,375
An NGO worker for Zamora.

235
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,166
Just be patient.

236
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,458
You'll be out in no time.

237
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,208
Everything is ready

238
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,833
in case you're not granted parole.

239
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,875
I'm running out of time.

240
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,166
The new guard is watching me.

241
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,375
<i>Gonzaga! Where are you?</i>

242
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,083
Like the last time, remember?

243
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,625
So how are we supposed to bring it in?

244
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,250
Leave it to Dom.

245
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,083
Who will do it, then?

246
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,708
We will.

247
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,083
Hey, now. Don't lose your nerve.

248
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,375
Tell Pol, too.

249
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,000
Dom won't like it if…

250
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
You don't need to tell us.

251
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,791
All right, hurry up.

252
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,958
I need to drink my meds.

253
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,500
We're done already. Hurry up.

254
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,041
Mang Gardo!

255
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,958
Mang Gardo, what did I tell you?

256
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,375
Gardo, possession again?

257
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,041
That was fast.

258
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,458
Where's Kitten?

259
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,083
He's just around here somewhere.

260
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,000
Headcount!

261
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,041
- Seven.
- Eight.

262
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,083
- Nine.
- Ten.

263
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,250
- 11.
- 12.

264
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,583
- 13.
- 14.

265
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,083
- 15.
- 16.

266
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,208
- 17.
- 18.

267
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,208
- 23.
- 24.

268
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,000
- 25.
- 26.

269
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,125
- 27.
- 28.

270
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,041
- 29.
- 30.

271
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,541
31.

272
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,583
Four are missing.

273
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,625
Look for them.

274
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,083
I told you not to fight back.

275
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,625
You're so stubborn.

276
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,833
You got what you were looking for, huh?

277
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,041
Dom warned you.

278
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,000
You didn't listen.

279
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,125
What's the fuss about?

280
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,958
He's not feeling too well.

281
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,666
Must be the heat.

282
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,666
Leave me alone.

283
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:07,916
Chief.

284
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,375
I'll take it from here.

285
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,666
Sup.

286
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,166
Gonzaga, what is it?

287
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,416
It's Zamora.

288
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,166
I have a hunch that
he's planning an escape.

289
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,458
A hunch?

290
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,500
There's a woman who always comes by.

291
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,625
She gives him something

292
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:20,583
and he gives something back to her…

293
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,125
What?

294
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,333
I don't know yet, sir.

295
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,666
But Bautista,

296
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,291
Zamora hurts him so that
he won't squeal about their plans.

297
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,958
Did he tell you that?

298
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,458
No, sir.

299
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,083
But I saw burn marks on him.

300
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,791
I checked and Zamora's the one
who uses the branding iron--

301
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,666
Gonzaga,

302
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,125
did I ever teach you to rely on a hunch?

303
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,666
For over a decade now,

304
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,416
from Central to San Fabian,

305
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,166
Zamora has kept a clean record.

306
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,416
I was like you when I was young.

307
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,833
So determined to fight crime,

308
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,375
so eager for justice to be served.

309
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:21,625
But the reality is different
from the concept.

310
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,541
Let's agree on something.

311
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,791
Prof.

312
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,250
Didn't you tell us in class

313
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,208
that the courts are there…

314
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,208
for the victims?

315
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,666
Then why?

316
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,250
Why does a criminal like Zamora
have the right to justice?

317
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,666
My sister never even had a chance.

318
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:48,958
Lisa?

319
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,208
Xavier.

320
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,541
This is awkward.

321
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,541
It's only been two months--

322
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,958
Thanks…

323
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,500
for coming all this way.

324
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,000
That's nothing.

325
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,208
I have a client here.

326
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,416
And I wanted to talk to you.

327
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,666
I can't go back to the city just yet.

328
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,750
I just wanted to ask you

329
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,833
if there's an update on my sister's case?

330
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:35,041
Did you get the photo?

331
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,541
It looks like the suspect, right?

332
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:43,375
Someone told me
he was seen on España Boulevard.

333
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,625
We could find out where he went,

334
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,375
where he lives.

335
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,541
It's been ten years, Xavier.

336
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,958
That's why there are cold cases.

337
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:07,916
No one cares.

338
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,833
I care!

339
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,750
I asked everyone I know
in Legal Assistance.

340
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:16,375
One blurred photo isn't enough.

341
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,916
The crime hasn't prescribed yet, Lisa.

342
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,625
There's a reason why the law is that way.

343
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,791
Lisa,

344
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,000
I still have some time.

345
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,666
Don't give up on me now.

346
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,083
Okay.

347
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,666
Sorry for the trouble.

348
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,291
I heard you tattled to the chief.

349
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,166
What's your beef with Zamora?

350
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,291
You know what your problem is?

351
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,041
You take this job too personally.

352
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,375
I read your file.

353
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:31,541
Now I know why you hate murderers.

354
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,166
Hey.

355
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,333
If you want to report to the chief,

356
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:43,625
you go through me.

357
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,333
I don't like your heroics.

358
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,833
It pisses me off.

359
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:34,166
<i>Sister!</i>

360
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,541
Sister!

361
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:53,208
Sister…

362
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,375
Sister?

363
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,125
Sister…

364
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,416
Sister…

365
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,000
Inspection!

366
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,916
Why'd you come back?

367
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,708
- You brought something in?
- No, sir.

368
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,791
- Those are just my clothes, sir.
- What did you bring in?

369
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,791
What's in here?

370
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:23,791
Open it.

371
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:27,666
That's just cat food, sir.

372
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,500
See?

373
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,333
Contraband.

374
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,041
You're hiding something.

375
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,541
What are you hiding in here?

376
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,791
What are you sneaking in?

377
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,791
Spit it out.

378
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:11,708
Dom.

379
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,250
Dom.

380
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,166
- Why don't you…
- What?

381
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,541
What are you hiding?

382
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,083
Say goodbye to your good conduct merits.

383
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,916
You'll never get out of here.

384
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:39,875
Take him.

385
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:00,791
Sup.

386
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,000
Here's the evidence.

387
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,333
<i>No TV!</i>

388
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,875
No visits.

389
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,958
You can't have pets. Take that out.

390
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,416
No favors.

391
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,333
We'll close the gates, until you tell me.

392
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,416
Now,

393
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,125
spit it out.

394
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,625
What's Zamora's plan?

395
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,750
When's the escape?

396
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:57,208
So, no one's going to admit it?
No one's going to talk?

397
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,333
Zamora!

398
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,916
I know you're just pretending.

399
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,583
I'm not your enemy.

400
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,041
There's a contract on my life.

401
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,250
- Liar!
- They'll kill me inside.

402
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,333
There's a job order.

403
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:23,291
They'll find someone to do it.

404
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:25,041
You're the murderer.

405
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,666
You're the murderer!

406
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,375
Eat first.

407
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:46,958
Murderer!

408
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,958
<i>No matter who it is,</i>

409
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,916
if you can help them, do it.

410
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,416
- Got it?
- Yes, big sis.

411
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,625
<i>Sister, wake up.</i>

412
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,125
Murderer!

413
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,916
Sister!

414
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,541
Stop!

415
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:18,291
<i>There's another place</i>
<i>to isolate prisoners in San Fabian.</i>

416
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,250
<i>A prison within a prison.</i>

417
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:26,333
<i>Cruz calls it The Cage.</i>

418
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,708
<i>A place for secrets.</i>

419
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:35,791
<i>Here, Zamora won't see daylight.</i>

420
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,750
<i>I may not have avenged my sister's death,</i>

421
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:47,000
<i>but I stopped a person like Zamora.</i>

422
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,791
No visitors allowed.

423
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,916
The prisoners committed a violation.

424
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,041
I'm just here for NGO work.
I won't take long.

425
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,750
It doesn't matter. They won't let you in.

426
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:11,458
Sorry, we'll tell you
when visitation opens.

427
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,666
Okay. Thank you.

428
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,500
Is your mom inside?

429
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,041
Or your aunt?

430
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,291
<i>My name is Domingo Zamora.</i>

431
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:01,208
<i>I just got out of jail</i>
<i>for petty theft and drugs.</i>

432
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,625
<i>I just got out.</i>

433
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,750
<i>Again.</i>

434
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,916
<i>You'd think that</i>
<i>I would stay out of trouble.</i>

435
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,791
<i>But no matter what I do,</i>

436
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,458
<i>I keep going back to the old ways.</i>

437
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,708
<i>I'm not a good person.</i>

438
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,083
Is anybody home?

439
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,875
<i>Until I met you.</i>

440
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,666
Are you Ruth?

441
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,291
Where's your mom?

442
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:15,625
Dom.

443
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,208
I haven't seen you in years.

444
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,791
How do you say "sorry"?

445
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:19,875
<i>I babysat you</i>
<i>so your mom could go to work.</i>

446
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,125
<i>It was the least I could do</i>
<i>after everything my sister did for me.</i>

447
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,125
Come eat.

448
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,291
Your mom will get mad at me.

449
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:36,875
Come on, eat now.

450
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,666
Later.

451
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,583
Ruth, do you like this?

452
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,166
<i>And when I didn't know what to do…</i>

453
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,250
Betty!

454
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,666
<i>Betty was a godsend.</i>

455
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,500
What happened? Where's Joanna?

456
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,000
She's at work.

457
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,708
Ruth is sick.
She's looking for her mom.

458
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,500
She has a fever. Come inside.

459
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,958
Sit here.

460
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,666
Do you want to try?

461
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,083
Blow it.

462
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:02,875
<i>I learned your language</i>
<i>so that we could speak.</i>

463
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,916
<i>So that you would never be alone.</i>

464
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,875
<i>In the eyes of everyone else,</i>

465
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:28,708
<i>we were the same.</i>

466
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:43,166
<i>Because of you, I saw myself differently.</i>

467
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:48,041
<i>The days turned into weeks.</i>

468
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,416
Now, let's set this aside
so you can blow the candle first.

469
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,208
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

470
00:43:56,291 --> 00:44:00,875
<i>The weeks turned</i>
<i>into months and years.</i>

471
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,875
Make a wish.

472
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:17,458
Thanks for everything.

473
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:20,958
I know you always look after Ruth.

474
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:24,708
That's nothing.
We've got each other, right?

475
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:48,500
You're bluffing, I'm your only uncle.

476
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,458
This is my favorite.

477
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:02,666
<i>But things would change</i>
<i>when your dad was around.</i>

478
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,291
What do you mean dangerous?

479
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:07,000
That's my daughter!

480
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,375
I know the things you do!

481
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,250
I know what you're doing.

482
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,166
I'll take her from you!

483
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,541
Even if I have to see you in court!

484
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:09,500
<i>Caloy taught me everything I know</i>
<i>about the streets.</i>

485
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:14,166
<i>He'd bail me out</i>
<i>of my problems with money…</i>

486
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,916
<i>with the law.</i>

487
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,125
<i>He knows people.</i>

488
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,500
<i>He has many connections.</i>

489
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:26,791
Dom, I don't see you
at the usual spots anymore.

490
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,666
I've got a new hustle.

491
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:40,875
<i>The truth was…</i>

492
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,375
<i>I was scared.</i>

493
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,208
Dom, I don't know what to do.

494
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,916
I don't want to go back there.

495
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,666
Betty has a quiet place
in the countryside.

496
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,291
Do you want to go away for a while?

497
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,125
She's been asking us to go.

498
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:08,125
I'd like that.

499
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,750
A peaceful place.

500
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:15,791
I regret introducing you to that man.

501
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,750
Dom, if something happens to me…

502
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:26,333
I want you to take care of Ruth.

503
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:29,041
Jo,

504
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,791
nothing's going to happen to you.

505
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,791
You act like you don't know him.

506
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,250
I don't want Ruth to grow up
in her father's world.

507
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,708
They're getting dangerous.

508
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:49,833
Do you know what they do to children?

509
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:55,625
I found out and now he's threatening me.

510
00:47:58,541 --> 00:47:59,708
Dom…

511
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:04,041
Whatever happens,

512
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,875
you have to promise me.

513
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,583
You won't give her to her father.

514
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,083
<i>We planned on leaving soon after.</i>

515
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,208
<i>But I didn't realize…</i>

516
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,500
Who is it?

517
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:31,125
<i>…it would be the last time</i>
<i>I would speak to Joanna.</i>

518
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,500
Hey!

519
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:43,958
Hey!

520
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,375
Sister?

521
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:57,833
Jo?

522
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,083
Sister…

523
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:16,666
Sister…

524
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,708
Sister…

525
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:30,708
Sister…

526
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:36,625
Sister…

527
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,875
Joanna!

528
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:14,416
Ruth?

529
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,875
<i>I knew I was going down for it.</i>

530
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:17,958
Ruth!

531
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,333
<i>Addict.</i>

532
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,041
<i>Thief. Criminal.</i>

533
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:25,750
Ruth!

534
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:31,541
<i>They would have taken me</i>
<i>and given you to your father,</i>

535
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:34,375
<i>before I could even defend myself.</i>

536
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,041
Betty!

537
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:22,791
Betty!

538
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:25,958
Help us.

539
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,750
We need to get away from here.

540
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,083
Dom!

541
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,750
The police!

542
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,541
Just don't wear them.

543
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,000
Go.

544
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,416
I'll hold them off.

545
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,958
But they'll take you.

546
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:31,541
It's either me or Ruth.

547
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:35,208
She can't go back to her father.

548
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,166
Acting so brave, aren't you?

549
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,958
Say it.

550
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,083
I already told you.

551
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,541
I threw her in the river.

552
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:33,958
<i>Jorge Delos Santos was</i>
<i>the prison chief inspector in Central</i>

553
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:35,833
<i>where I was first incarcerated.</i>

554
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,000
<i>He would soon change my life in prison.</i>

555
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:54,833
Next time you want to escape,
don't use the front door.

556
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:58,625
There are lots of ways to get out of here.

557
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:04,500
The thing is, all these corrupt officers
only answer to money.

558
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,625
Seems you've got a powerful enemy.

559
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:12,166
Their roots in this system are too deep.

560
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,000
Let me guess.

561
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:32,333
You're innocent.

562
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:39,375
Aren't you all?

563
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:57,916
I'm not a good person.

564
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:06,250
It's my fault that my sister is gone.

565
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,500
I deserve to die…

566
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:27,125
Not Joanna.

567
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,708
I'll do anything

568
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:45,416
to get out of here.

569
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:52,916
There's another way.

570
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,958
It won't be easy,

571
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,333
but there is a way.

572
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:10,166
You can walk out right now if you want to.

573
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,541
But if you escape,

574
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:17,625
they'll hunt you all your life.

575
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:22,791
Zamora.

576
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:28,083
If you give yourself the chance…

577
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,000
you could earn your freedom.

578
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:36,250
The question is,

579
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:40,625
what kind of person will come out
on the other side?

580
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,958
<i>I confessed to something I never did,</i>

581
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:50,375
<i>and from then on, I kept my silence,</i>

582
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:54,083
<i>so that they would never find you.</i>

583
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,666
<i>Chief Delos Santos brought me</i>
<i>to San Fabian</i>

584
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,458
<i>as a transferee from Manila.</i>

585
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,958
<i>He needed an ally in the new colony.</i>

586
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,875
<i>I kept my silence.</i>

587
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:18,666
Watch out.

588
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,250
There are eyes and ears everywhere.

589
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:24,916
<i>He knew about Caloy's syndicate.</i>

590
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,291
Remember.

591
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:30,458
Every act of goodness
brings you closer to freedom.

592
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:39,541
<i>Betty found me a few years later.</i>

593
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,291
<i>She brought you</i>

594
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:49,125
<i>to the nearby mainland where you grew up.</i>

595
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:08,875
<i>She is the good one, Ruth.</i>

596
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:16,083
<i>Tell her that I'll always be grateful.</i>

597
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:26,166
<i>Because Chief believed it…</i>

598
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,375
<i>I soon believed that I would make it out</i>

599
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:33,958
<i>and see you again.</i>

600
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:41,416
<i>I started writing you these letters, Ruth.</i>

601
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:44,958
DEAR RUTH, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

602
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:49,625
<i>But no one else could know.</i>

603
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,750
Thank you.

604
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,750
When I get out of here,

605
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,666
I'll go back to the countryside

606
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,875
and become a delivery rider.

607
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:19,458
And where will you get the money?

608
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:20,833
I'll find a way!

609
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,708
Stop it. Are you high?

610
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:28,000
I'll open up a store.

611
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,875
And everyone can loan from there.

612
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:31,875
That's good.

613
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:35,083
I think I'll go back
to the countryside too.

614
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,166
Life there is simple.

615
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,583
Maybe I'll do some farming.

616
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:42,250
I'm used to it here, anyway.

617
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:45,041
I'll marry Nelia.

618
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,583
We aren't married yet.

619
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:54,208
Luis and I will try to start over.

620
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,666
Of course.

621
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,583
We'll finish our college degrees.

622
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,083
FOOD FOR KITTEN!

623
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:18,541
<i>We gave the tree a new name.</i>

624
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,250
<i>The wishes are simple,</i>
<i>but when they're granted,</i>

625
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:28,041
<i>the prisoners remember</i>
<i>that they're still human.</i>

626
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:35,625
I'll turn this in tomorrow.

627
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,625
Congratulations, Zamora.

628
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:40,375
You'll soon be free.

629
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:44,125
Hang in there.

630
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:47,000
Take care of your friends.

631
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:52,416
And never let anyone take away your hope.

632
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,541
<i>San Fabian was peaceful for a decade.</i>

633
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,791
<i>But eventually,</i>

634
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,833
<i>Chief's health declined.</i>

635
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,125
<i>With the chief gone,</i>

636
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:47,125
<i>darkness slowly made its way inside.</i>

637
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,666
<i>The abuses started with Cruz.</i>

638
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:54,791
<i>When the new guard came,</i>

639
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:57,416
<i>we watched him closely.</i>

640
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,916
<i>For many years,</i>

641
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,541
<i>I taught my companions</i>
<i>the language you taught me.</i>

642
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:14,416
<i>We found a code</i>
<i>so that we could speak freely.</i>

643
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,791
Like a Saint, when asleep.

644
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:22,291
I can't read him.

645
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:24,208
Don't judge,

646
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,125
he might be able to help us.

647
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:31,625
Property of San Fabian,
you can't take it out.

648
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:38,416
You take care,
don't do anything you'll regret.

649
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,958
- Gardo!
- Gardo!

650
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,208
Why are you back here?

651
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:54,041
<i>Mang Gardo was released ahead of us.</i>

652
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,375
<i>But he soon came back.</i>

653
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:59,500
Mang Gardo, I'll wring your neck!

654
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:01,583
Why are you back?

655
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,208
It's lonely out there.

656
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,291
<i>He came back on his own</i>

657
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:09,166
<i>because there was no one</i>
<i>waiting for him outside.</i>

658
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:12,875
What happened?

659
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,166
It's okay.

660
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:19,166
<i>It started with kickbacks and favors.</i>

661
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,041
<i>Until Cruz started recruiting inmates</i>

662
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:25,666
<i>for job orders outside</i>
<i>and within the walls.</i>

663
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:29,166
<i>Those who disobey are punished.</i>

664
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,625
<i>We heard from the grapevine</i>

665
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,666
<i>that the first contract</i>

666
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,916
<i>was for my life.</i>

667
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,375
Everything is ready

668
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,500
in case you're not granted parole.

669
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:02,375
I'm running out of time.

670
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,000
The new guard is watching me.

671
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:12,208
Go ahead.

672
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:13,541
Be careful.

673
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:18,416
<i>We came up with a bold plan.</i>

674
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:28,916
<i>To record Cruz' wrongdoings.</i>

675
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:42,083
Who will take the video?

676
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:48,000
I'll do it.

677
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:50,125
I'll help you.

678
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,125
Me too.

679
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,375
Don't.

680
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:58,166
Stay away from Cruz.

681
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:02,041
Isn't this dangerous?

682
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,958
Just be careful.

683
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:07,416
No one can find out.

684
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:12,375
This is our only hope.

685
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:16,500
Give it to me.

686
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,291
Now.

687
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:25,166
<i>We knew it was a gamble.</i>

688
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,208
<i>All our good conduct time</i>
<i>could be revoked.</i>

689
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:32,875
<i>But maybe they'll listen to us.</i>

690
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,041
Hurry up!

691
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:38,458
Were you surprised?

692
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,541
Slowly.

693
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:46,166
See? You got what you were looking for.

694
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:49,041
Dom warned you. You didn't listen.

695
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,750
What's the fuss about?

696
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,125
Chief, he's not feeling too well.

697
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,083
Must be the heat.

698
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,000
<i>Like a ritual,</i>

699
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:07,750
<i>I repeated my promise to you.</i>

700
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,958
<i>I didn't forget, Ruth.</i>

701
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:15,583
<i>Please wait for your uncle.</i>

702
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,250
Zamora.

703
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,458
<i>But if I don't make it out,</i>

704
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,416
<i>I hope you can use these letters.</i>

705
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:37,375
<i>If not now, if it isn't safe,</i>

706
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:40,000
<i>then maybe in the years to come.</i>

707
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:42,916
<i>So that everyone would know</i>

708
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,666
<i>that we lived here inside San Fabian.</i>

709
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,875
<i>And we have something to say.</i>

710
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,833
<i>I hope our plan succeeds.</i>

711
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:57,541
<i>I hope we are freed.</i>

712
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,833
<i>I hope to see you again,</i>

713
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:03,833
<i>even just one more time.</i>

714
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,750
Are you going to put us in jail?

715
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,333
Were you the one
who left him the raft so he could escape?

716
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,250
So what if it was me?

717
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,750
Did you hurt Dom?

718
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,666
Murderer!

719
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:39,541
Send him to isolation?

720
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:42,541
Go inside!

721
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:45,291
What now?

722
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,125
Jail me if you want to.

723
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:52,041
Just don't hurt the child.

724
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:54,708
I don't plan on hurting you.

725
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,041
Where's Dom?

726
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,416
Is he still alive?

727
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:28,625
Gonzaga, another emergency?

728
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,750
It's Zamora.

729
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:31,208
His niece is alive.

730
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,791
Are you certain?

731
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,541
I'm sure of it.

732
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:45,375
Can you point
to the location of the child?

733
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,500
Yes, sir.

734
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,250
And Zamora's letters?

735
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,041
She has them.

736
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,125
Good.

737
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:57,625
I've called someone who knows this case.

738
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,958
There he is.

739
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,416
Gonzaga,

740
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,166
this is Carlos Pineda.

741
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,416
You might recognize him
from his gaming business.

742
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:17,041
He is Ruth's father.

743
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,041
Gonzaga.

744
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:31,166
Thank you for investigating.

745
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,750
Are you sure that Ruth is alive?

746
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:35,750
Where can I see her?

747
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:36,666
No problem.

748
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:41,416
Sir, I'm not sure they'll meet us

749
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,791
if we don't have Zamora.

750
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:47,083
That was our agreement.

751
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:51,333
Did Zamora ever mention in his letters

752
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:53,625
who it was that conspired against him?

753
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,750
No, sir.

754
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:05,708
Get Zamora.

755
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:10,625
Yes, sir.

756
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,708
Gonzaga?

757
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:48,583
Sir, can I talk to you?

758
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:49,958
I just want to speak on behalf of--

759
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:52,500
- Later.
- Please, wait.

760
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:57,750
I want you to know that
Dom is not a bad person.

761
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,500
If it's all right with you,
can we speak for a while?

762
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:07,458
All right.

763
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:18,333
When we were still in Central,

764
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:22,458
the others would harass me and Luis.

765
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:25,333
Only Dom helped us.

766
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:32,125
Even though they hurt him afterwards.

767
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:36,041
If it wasn't for Dom…

768
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:40,375
we could've killed
someone else back there.

769
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:49,208
Weren't you imprisoned…

770
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:52,458
for killing Luis' uncle?

771
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,000
Minyong!

772
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,541
The truth is…

773
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:08,125
Luis was abused.

774
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,000
One night,

775
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:14,041
he was raped.

776
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,583
And then,

777
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:20,666
we had to fight back.

778
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,750
There was a hammer and…

779
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:26,666
Sir, Dom is a good man.

780
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:30,375
He finds ways to get us medicine
when supplies run out.

781
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:32,041
It's true, sir.

782
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:36,333
He even bought my son
a new pair of shoes.

783
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,458
We've done terrible things in the past.

784
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:53,083
And we regret them deeply.

785
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,208
But I hope you'll still listen to us.

786
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:58,916
For Dom.

787
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:10,083
What should I say?

788
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,625
Boss!

789
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:14,291
What is it?

790
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:16,791
Boss, there's fighting in the dormitories.

791
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:19,125
So what? Why are you out here?

792
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:22,166
No, sir.
It's too rowdy, one guard isn't enough.

793
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,125
CO Gonzaga is asking for help.

794
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,916
Didn't Gonzaga lock you in?

795
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,083
He locked us in,
but it was just chaotic there.

796
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,541
Zamora.

797
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:00,791
It's Ruth.

798
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:03,833
She wants to see you.

799
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:27,750
Hey! Stop it!

800
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,291
I told you to stop.

801
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:33,208
Not me.

802
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:37,166
Why are you laughing, huh?
Whose idea was this?

803
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40,666
- Boss, they were fighting!
- They were fighting a while ago.

804
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,791
- Are you playing tricks on me?
- Boss…

805
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,750
Where's Gonzaga? You said he was here.

806
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:48,666
- He was here.
- Yes, we saw him.

807
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:52,625
- You won't make a fool out of me!
- Sir! No!

808
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,791
We have proof of what you've done!

809
01:16:58,875 --> 01:16:59,833
What is that?

810
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,041
What did you say?

811
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,916
Move! Out of my way!

812
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,125
You.

813
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,291
Move it!

814
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,791
Get out of my way!

815
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:13,708
Move it!

816
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,583
Come here.

817
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:18,333
What did you say?

818
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:19,416
Come.

819
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,416
You were saying something?

820
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,708
Is this what you mean?

821
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:30,625
You want me to smash this on your face?

822
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,750
Is this it?

823
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:39,416
Give that to me!

824
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,041
We've had enough!

825
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:56,333
Then you can all burn in hell.

826
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:12,916
Water!

827
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:24,541
<i>- Cruz.</i>
- Sup.

828
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:25,750
<i>Where are you?</i>

829
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,416
<i>Secure Zamora.</i>

830
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,041
Yes, Sup.

831
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:41,791
Zamora, go on.

832
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:44,291
I'll take care of it.

833
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,708
<i>What's that smoke?</i>

834
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:02,458
<i>Is it coming from the dorms?</i>

835
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:05,166
<i>Call the station!</i>

836
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:09,458
They need help.

837
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:16,458
You go first. I'll be with you soon.

838
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:28,541
I'll come back for you.

839
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:53,166
Mang Gardo needs us.

840
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,958
Why didn't you kill him
when Delos Santos was gone?

841
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:08,041
Our whole operation's at risk
if Zamora talks.

842
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:12,750
Don't you realize
it's been peaceful here for years?

843
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:15,916
I'll be to blame if something happens.

844
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,750
Zamora can't die inside.

845
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,875
So what am I paying you for?

846
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:21,625
He was going to be eliminated outside.

847
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:24,500
Someone on the mainland was set to do it.

848
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:28,083
I had Cruz take care of it.

849
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,916
Everything was thought out,

850
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,041
even Cruz' replacement.

851
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:41,541
Sup, Gonzaga betrayed us.

852
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,583
Zamora already escaped once.

853
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:46,666
You should have done the job then.

854
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,083
- But Sup--
- You little…

855
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:50,541
What was I supposed to do?
Gonzaga was there.

856
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:51,458
Idiot.

857
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:54,416
My reputation is on the line.

858
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,000
I told you.

859
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:58,750
There should be no trouble from inside!

860
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,333
I'm sorry, Cruz.

861
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:06,333
Prepare yourself to take responsibility
for everything that happened here.

862
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:09,166
Sup, I was just following your orders.

863
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,208
And you got caught.

864
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:12,250
- But Sup--
- It's done, Cruz.

865
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:14,375
This is part of your oath, isn't it?

866
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:18,250
"I am ready to face
the consequences of my actions--"

867
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:23,500
Who's the idiot now?

868
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:28,875
- Help!
- Help!

869
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:33,041
Give way!

870
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:45,583
Get out! Get out now!

871
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,416
Get out!

872
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:56,291
Kitten!

873
01:23:58,291 --> 01:23:59,125
Get out.

874
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:02,750
Sir. Slow down.

875
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:04,166
Hold on. Come this way.

876
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,458
Where's Mang Gardo?

877
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:11,000
Dom!

878
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,500
Dom! It's Luis!

879
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,333
Kitten…

880
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:26,791
- Mang Gardo's still inside.
- Take care of him.

881
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:36,291
Come on. Hurry up!

882
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:37,291
Mang Gardo.

883
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:43,125
We need to leave.

884
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,541
Mang Gardo.

885
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,875
Dom.

886
01:25:58,125 --> 01:25:58,958
Dom.

887
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:07,291
Dom!

888
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:17,416
Dom.

889
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:24,791
- Ruth. She is waiting for you.
- Dom.

890
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:31,958
You promised you'd come back for her.

891
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,333
Dom.

892
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:48,333
Tell her that I tried.

893
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:15,708
Dom.

894
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:11,375
<i>When Dom died,</i>

895
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:15,000
<i>the PDLs sat in silence under the tree</i>
<i>for seven days</i>

896
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:19,541
<i>to protest the abuses that happened.</i>

897
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:24,291
<i>What they did turned into myth</i>

898
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:26,833
<i>and spread throughout other colonies.</i>

899
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:33,791
<i>When they want to protest any wrongdoing,</i>

900
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:37,458
<i>they would not speak for a day.</i>

901
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,916
<i>After a long time,</i>

902
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:47,166
<i>Dom's innocence was finally proven.</i>

903
01:28:49,166 --> 01:28:51,958
<i>But he never saw himself vindicated.</i>

904
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:04,208
<i>Sometimes, I wonder.</i>

905
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:08,583
<i>What would have happened</i>
<i>if I just let him go the first time?</i>

906
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:13,000
<i>Would things have turned out differently?</i>

907
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:20,000
<i>But I can't change the past.</i>

908
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:23,375
<i>I can only ask</i>

909
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,750
<i>for your forgiveness, Ruth.</i>

910
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,208
Ruth made it to pre-med.

911
01:29:42,291 --> 01:29:44,958
Thank you for all your help, Xavier.

912
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:48,125
It's nothing.

913
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:41,416
<i>Time passed.</i>

914
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,958
<i>And the day of freedom finally arrived.</i>

915
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:48,708
Galang, Adorado.

916
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:52,708
Thank you.

917
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,333
Thank you so much.

918
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:59,375
<i>But some need a little more time.</i>

919
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:01,583
Sevilla, Edgardo.

920
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:03,291
Edgardo!

921
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:09,833
- Mang Gardo.
- Kitten and I are free!

922
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:11,875
Take care.

923
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:13,666
<i>Every time we set prisoners free,</i>

924
01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:16,666
<i>there is a ritual in San Fabian.</i>

925
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:20,125
<i>Zamora, Domingo.</i>

926
01:31:22,291 --> 01:31:24,416
<i>When we call Dom's name,</i>

927
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:29,333
<i>it's as if we set him free</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

928
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:33,250
<i>Who is good?</i>

929
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:37,416
<i>And who is evil?</i>

930
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:41,625
<i>Are people born righteous?</i>

931
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,500
<i>Or wicked?</i>

932
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:52,166
<i>Can goodness grow</i>
<i>from those who have done wrong?</i>

933
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:03,250
<i>There is a belief</i>

934
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,541
<i>that finding green bones</i>

935
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:12,416
<i>in a person's remains…</i>

936
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:18,125
<i>is proof of</i>
<i>that person's goodness in life.</i>

937
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:30,875
<i>They did not find one green bone</i>
<i>in Dom's ashes.</i>

938
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:35,083
BE A GOOD PERSON

939
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,916
<i>They found</i>

940
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:43,583
<i>a hundred.</i>
