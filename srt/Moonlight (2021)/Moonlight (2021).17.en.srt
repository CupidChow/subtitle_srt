This is great!

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,009
Chief Editor Yu and Ms Suo Heng
finally reconciled.

6
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,070
What are you doing?

7
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,830
Give it back to me!

8
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,229
I have to tell her
to take care of herself.

9
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,190
You're indeed the Mama Duck.

10
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,150
She's my author.

11
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,910
It's my job to care for her.

12
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,310
I'm also your author.

13
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,229
Yet you weren't

14
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,490
so concerned about me when I was writing.

15
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,830
Speaking of that,

16
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,620
I've got some ideas for your new work,

17
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,150
Huang Quan Inn.

18
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,910
Hold on.

19
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,190
I've never said that

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,320
you'll be the editor of Huang Quan Inn.

21
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,470
Take a look at my proposal.

22
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm sure you'll know

23
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,829
that I'm your best choice.

24
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,950
I've drawn up a detailed plan

25
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,510
regarding the illustrator
and the book cover.

26
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,150
You're well-prepared.

27
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,210
You even carry it around with you.

28
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,510
You've prepared a lot.

29
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,870
It's good enough to be published already.

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,940
This is my brand new sincerity.

31
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,900
What's brand new sincerity?

32
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,230
Since every work is different,

33
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,030
I shall show my fresh sincerity for them.

34
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,990
I'll treat it as though it's my first time

35
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,260
being your editor.

36
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,260
I'll do my best.

37
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,710
Why are you so eager to

38
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,440
be the editor of Huang Quan Inn?

39
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,190
A lot of people are eager to do so.

40
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,990
Is that so?

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,940
Is that the only reason?

42
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,870
Also...

43
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,870
[If Drama King knows that I'm eager]

[to sign him up]

45
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,230
[for the sake of other author,]

46
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,910
[it'll definitely hurt his pride.]

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,110
Also, it's such a great honour

48
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,630
to be your editor.

49
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,030
Are you sure?

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,829
It's a compliment. Why are you leaving?

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,710
As expected from Ms Suo Heng.

52
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,790
It only took her half a day

53
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,990
to come up with three different topics.

54
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,140
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

55
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,870
Did you receive the topics from Suo Heng?

56
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,510
Yes, I'm looking at them.

57
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,110
[Send a copy to Mr Xia.]

58
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,950
[By the way,]

59
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,910
I've asked Mr Zhou Chuan.

60
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,310
[I told him that I wish to sign him up]

61
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,510
[so that Suo Heng gets the chance
to publish in our magazine again.]

62
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,910
Mr Zhou Chuan is very generous.

63
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,750
He doesn't have any hard feelings.

64
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,820
[And he understood that.]

65
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,220
You told him everything?

66
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,510
Mr Zhou Chuan is a smart man.

67
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,950
Rather than being told by
someone with ulterior motives,

68
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,870
he might as well hear it from us.

69
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,710
Mr Zhou Chuan,

70
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,790
I know you've had a long day

71
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,790
and so I prepared

72
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,920
a fruit platter that is double in size.

73
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,840
I don't want it if you cut it like this.

74
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,830
What do you mean?

75
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,690
It's the common way to cut apples.

76
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,590
I'm sorry,

77
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,830
Mr Zhou Chuan.

78
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,030
For not telling you about Ms Suo Heng.

79
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,960
I was afraid you'd misunderstand.

80
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,670
About what?

81
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,070
Do I seem petty to you?

82
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,710
No, not at all.

83
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,180
Even if it weren't because of Ms Suo Heng,

84
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,590
I'm genuinely interested

85
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,230
to sign you up for your book.

86
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,270
You're scraping off my scalp!

87
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,870
I have to focus on the ending of

88
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,870
Huang Quan Inn these two days.

89
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,350
Don't knock on my door.

90
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,310
Don't even call me at mealtime.

91
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,740
Leave the food at the door.

92
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,940
I'll open the door when I'm hungry.

93
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,710
Sir,

94
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,190
who will be the editor for Huang Quan Inn?

95
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,100

96

98
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,590

The topic of Six Eared Macaque

102
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,090
is Suo Heng's idea?

103
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,350
Yes.

104
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,150
It's completely different from

105
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,550
the other two topics.

106
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,230
It broke the usual setting of light novel

107
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,350
that the female writers
in Moonlight Magazine

108
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,110
have always adhered.

109
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,390
Personally, I think this is a great idea.

110
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,430
I like that.

111
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,670
It visualizes

112
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,710
the conflicts between Taoism

113
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,710
and Buddhism.

114
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,420
Ask her if she can

115
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,590
further explain the saying

116
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,590
"The dharma is not to be
transmitted to the sixth ear".

117
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,470
Sure, I'll give her the message.

118
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,950
Thank you, Mr Xia.

119
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,030
Mr Xia, I think Suo Heng's

120
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,630
story outline is good enough

121
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,620
even if we don't

122
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,110
sign Mr Zhou Chuan up for his new book.

123
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,910
It can definitely meet

124
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,990
the criteria

125
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,320
of Moonlight Magazine.

126
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,390
Indeed, the only way to shut everybody up

127
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,390
is to show them the work.

128
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,260
Although we manage to

129

save Suo Heng

130
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,990
by signing up Zhou Chuan,

her only means of survival

132

I'll be the editor of his new work.

136
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,310
Really?

137
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,190
Yes, we'll sign the contract

138
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,870
once he finishes his book.

139
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,470
Maybe after the book fair.

140
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,909
That's great!

141
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,550
Push forward the progress

142
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,790
as Chinese New Year is

143
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,070

144
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,990
Prepare the contract quickly.

145
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,710
Okay.

146
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,750
By the way,

147
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,110
what's our progress on the book fair?

148
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,150
Director Yang has ordered

149
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,500
that the book fair

150
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,470
must have total sales

151
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,990
of 2 million yuan,

152
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,600
which are 20% higher than
the previous year's sales.

153
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,950
We have to fight a tough battle.

154
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,030
Don't worry about the book fair.

155
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,670
We've already started on it.

156
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,630
But I wonder what
the circulation department

157
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,750
will come up with

158
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,910
to boost the sales.

159
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,070
Hold on.

160
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,670
That's their job.

161
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,270
All we need to do is to
try our best to cooperate.

162
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,890
But you must remember,

163
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,750
circulation and editorial department

164
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,830
are not enemies,

165
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,100
but friends.

166
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,030
I understand.

167
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,590
Since Mr Xia said so,

168
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,820
let's try to get along with them.

169
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,020
Chief Editor Yu.

170
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,220
Congratulations.

171
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,190
Suo Heng is finally back.

172
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,850
But here's a gentle reminder.

173
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,480
Don't forget Director Yang's condition.

174
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,230
Mr Zhou Chuan has agreed

175
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,160
that I'll be the editor of his book.

176
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,510
There's no proof.

177
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,010
Where's the contract?

178
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,990
Mr Liang,

179
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,820
the book fair is around the corner.

180
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,990
You should be taking charge
of the work in your department.

181
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,320
Why did you keep coming to our department?

182
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,470
I know Director Yang
gave you some privileges,

183
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,950
but you're taking it too far.

184
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,430
Chief Director Yu,
don't take this the wrong way.

185
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,670
Mr Liang is here to

186
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,190
talk about the book fair with me.

187
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,510
And you, Miao.

188
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,830
What's written on the staff card

189
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,510
hanging around your neck?

190
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,190
Deputy editor of the second section
of editorial department.

191
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,630
I'm the chief editor.

192
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,700
Mr Liang should have

193
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,310
come to me

194
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,710
instead of you.

195
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,390
Chief Editor Yu,

196
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,550
you have a very strong hierarchical sense.

197
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,870
That's some feudal dross. It's no good.

198
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,670
We're all doing our job.

199
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,190
Does it matter who is the chief

200
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,190
or deputy editor?

201
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,790
Mr Liang, I'm shocked you'd ask.

202
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,740
You said it yourself,

203
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,940
that nothing can be done without rules.

204
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,310
Did you forget it?

205
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:42,780
Yes,

206
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,910
I don't care about the hierarchy

207
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,070
of authority at all.

208
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,630
I know the only rule that
an editor has to follow

209
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,290
is to take care of the authors.

210
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,590
Okay, Chief Editor Yu, I got it.

211
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,790
Xiao Niao,

212
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,150
and you.

213
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,260
You and Chu Li joined us not long ago.

214
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,390
You must never act like

215
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,220
a brown-noser or
take an opportunistic approach.

216
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,320
I understand, Chief Editor Yu.

217
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,150
Impressive.

218
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,150
Chief Editor Yu, that's so cool.

219
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,630
Kiddos,

220
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,030
your leader is so nice that

221
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,710
she instructs and gives you
sincere advice every day.

222
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,670
You'd certainly succeed.

223
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,350
I see greatness in all of you!

224
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,910
I'm so jealous.

225
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,110
How great it is.

226
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,270
Mr Liang, just a gentle reminder.

227
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,150
Don't eat too much chocolate.

228
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,600
You'll get grouchy.

229
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,030
You went a little too far.

230
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,350
Where's your manner?

231
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,590
Mr Liang, wait for me.

232
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,180
Chief Editor Yu, that was so cool.

233
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,390
Everyone said you're just like me
when I was young.

234
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,630
But I think you look nothing like me.

235
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,270
How is that possible?

236
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,790
I can never be as good as you.

237
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,230
You're much better than me.

238
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,060
Did I just get a compliment
from Chief Editor Yu?

239
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,710
Ms Suo Heng,

240
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,750
you changed your style.

241
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,660
I could barely recognize you.

242
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,910
I'm taking this opportunity

243
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,640
to turn into a whole new person.

244
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,070
Right,

245
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,430
I had a meeting with
Chief Editor Yu and Mr Xia.

246
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,030
All of us think that the third topic

247
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,030
is very interesting.

248
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,310
Especially Mr Xia.

249
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,420
He has a message for you.

250
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,750
He asked if you can further
explain the saying...

251
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,750
The dharma...

252
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,950
The dharma is not to be
transmitted to the sixth ear?

253
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,950
Yes, the dharma is not to be
transmitted to the sixth ear.

254
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,810
Do you have a new interpretation?

255
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,230
I thought you wouldn't

256
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,510
pick this topic.

257
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,710
You said that nobody would like it

258
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,750
if it's not a fluff

259
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,790
romance novel.

260
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,660
Who says you can't sense
the charisma from a document?

261
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,550
I can clearly see

262
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,630
the bold text

263
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,950
on all the three documents

264
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,110
you sent me.

265
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,550
Pick me!

266
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,630
I know

267
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,630
you want to write about this, right?

268
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,710
I've thought it all out.

269
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,830
Even if you decline

270
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,270
all the three topics

271
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,150
and I can

272
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,880
no longer publish my work
in Moonlight Magazine,

273
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,550
I'd never give up.

274
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,100
I'm going to keep doing this

275
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,030
until

276
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,740
I manage to write something incredible.

277
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,190
I don't want my readers

278
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,510
to be disappointed.

279
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,590
I wonder if I have the chance to

280
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,980
participate in the making
of this masterpiece.

281
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,110
In my opinion,

282
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,110
the utmost requirement

283
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,470
to reach your goal

284
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,310
is your passion in writing.

285
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,900
So...

286
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,830
Good luck, Ms Suo Heng!

287
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,750
Thanks, Chu Li.

288
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,190
One more thing.

289
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,680
As a matter of fact, Chief Editor Yu
has always cared for you.

290
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,510
I know that.

291
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,290
But so many years have passed.

292
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,950
I don't know what to say

293
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,270
when I see her again.

294
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,110
Anyway, we are in a good place now.

295
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,830
We get to live our own lives

296
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,230
without resentments

297
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,630
and misunderstandings.

298
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,780
And we won't impose a burden

299
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,150
on one another.

300
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,790
I was relying too heavily on her.

301
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,910
But now I know better.

302
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,950
Only you

303
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,910
can solve your own problems.

304
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,550
Going out late at night?

305
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,190
I have

306
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,110
a movie date with Mr Jiang.

307
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,070
I have to work hard at home

308
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,200
while you're on a movie date with a guy?

309
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,860
Stop making me look like

310
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,870
a heartless rat who is having an affair.

311
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,950
You're working hard
for the sake of yourself.

312
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,900
Say that again?

313
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,430
Mr Zhou Chuan,

314
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,470
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,950
I know you're working very hard.

316
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,550
Just leave the plates on the table

317
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,470
when you're done.

318
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,710
I'll wash them when I'm back.

319
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,630
Thanks for your hard work.

320
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,310
Hello.

321
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,100
[Hey, Gu Bai Zhi.]

322
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
[Do you have movie tickets?]

323
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,590
You're not making any sense.
Buy it yourself.

324
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,310
I want a particular seat.

325
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,700
[Jiang Yu Cheng went for a movie]

326
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,710
[with my editor.]

327
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,030
They are dating behind my back.

328
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,630
I didn't know that until now.

329
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,150
What does it have to do with me?

330
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,500
[Cut it out.]

331
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,630
I asked her already.

332
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,870
They are going to watch
Sui San Duo's movie.

333
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,150
[I know you guys are]

334
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,390
close with Sui San Duo.

335
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,030
I'm sure you have the ticket

336
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,960
for the seat next to Jiang Yu Cheng.

337
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,060
See you at the gate in five minutes.

338
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,190
I'm hanging up. Bye.

339
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,020
Here.

340
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,030
Thanks.

341
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,390
You must have lots of work.

342
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,050
You keep checking your phone.

343
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,510
No, it's Mr Zhou Chuan.

344
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,670
He kept asking about the movie

345
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,430
ever since I left the house.

346
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,830
I didn't know he's interested

347
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,100
in literary film.

348
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,120
I guess he's worried about you.

349
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,670
What should he worry about?

350
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,390
We are not strangers to one another.

351
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,710
Sorry. Excuse me.

352
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,470
Director Gu?

353
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,990
Mr Zhou Chuan?

354
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,950
You're here for the movie too?

355
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,630
Move over, please.

356
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,490
That's my seat.

357
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,780
I don't want to.

358
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,370
Sit with the person who came with you.

359
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,950
I wasn't talking to you.

360
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,310
Did you not hear me?

361
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,370
Sit with the person who came with you.

362
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,550
I'm sitting next to you.

363
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,190
Are you here with me?

364
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,170
You don't have to come.

365
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,030
You think you own the cinema?

366
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,490
Why should I listen to you?

367
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,230
I'm going to sit here anyway.

368
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,430
This is the centre of the theatre.

369
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,490
It's the best spot.

370
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,420
All these four seats are in the centre.

371
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,830
Do you have a cast in one eye

372
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,910
or what?

373
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,670
Why are you fighting
for the centre position?

374
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,110
Are you here to walk the red carpet?

375
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,910
I can tell that from his clothes.

376
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,350
You guys keep moving around.

377
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,630
Are you done with the discussion?

378
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,230
The movie is starting soon.

379
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,430
Fine, get up.

380
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,700
Chu Li, let me send you home.

381
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,829
Zhou Chuan's been working on his book.

382
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,760
I'm afraid he's too tired to drive.

383
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,950
I'll go get the car.

384
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,590
We need to talk about work
on the way home.

385
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,430
Zhou Chuan is still willing to talk
about work at night.

386
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,490
You're doing a good job as his editor.

387
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,750
It's nothing.

388
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,870
I didn't expect that
Ms Sui San Duo's movie

389
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,750
is talking about two people
who met online.

390
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,900
They have dated online for three years

391
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,100
but they never met each other in person.

392
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,860
You've known Mr Fox for three years

393
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,830
and you've never met him in person too.

394
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,230
I asked him to come out but he refused...

395
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,510
[How come Mr Jiang Yu Cheng]

396
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,110
[knows that I've known
Mr Fox for three years?]

397
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,390
Don't just stand there. Hop in.

398
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,150
Jiang Yu Chen,

399
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,280
you'll send Gu Bai Zhi back to her home.

400
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,550
Get in the car quickly.

401
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,550
Coming!

402
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,630
I'll get going then.

403
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,020
Drive slowly.

404
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,180
Is it okay for you? Forget it if it's not.

405
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,870
Let's go.

406
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:15,340
♫ They say strange things
and keep rapport ♫

407
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,310
How did you know I like this song?

408
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,430
I don't know.

409
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,760
But I like this song too.

410
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,460
How is that possible?

411
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,510
You must have peeped my playlist.

412
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:23,270
♫ Guileless adults are reduced to a joke ♫

413
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,270
Grow up.

414
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,190
Did you?

415
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,300
No.

416
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,530
♫ Unceasingly ♫

417
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,270
Sorry.

418
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,630
When are you going home?

419
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,830
Have you bought your ticket?

420
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,670
So tired already?

421
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,790
Why are you still awake at this hour?

422
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,190
I couldn't sleep.

423
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,150
What's the problem?

424
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,750
Mr Zhou Chuan,

425
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,350
I suspect that

426
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,750
Mr Jiang is Mr Fox.

427
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,870
What?

428
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,070
Right,

429
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,590
I should have figured it out.

430
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,030
Mr Fox's full name

431
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,150
is The Disappearing Mr Fox.

432
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,150
And Mr Jiang's masterpiece

433
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,180
is the Disappearing Series.

434
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,400
How did you link them together?

435
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,140
Think about it.

436
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,150
There's no one in the world

437
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,950
who knows you more than Jiang Yu Cheng.

438
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,830
If there's someone who can

439
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,030
easily mimic

440
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,670
your writing style,

441
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,830
it must be none other than him.

442
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,660
This is so easy.

443
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,950
I should have figured it out.

444
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,910
Say that again?

445
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,260
Easily mimic Zhou Chuan's writing style?

446
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,580
Who are you kidding?

447
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,510
Who can mimic me?

448
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,780
Jiang Yu Cheng?

449
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,510
And I shamelessly boasted

450
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,630
that Mr Fox is my boyfriend.

451
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,350
I made fun of the illustrators and authors

452
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,270
in front of him every day

453
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,710
because I thought he's an outsider.

454
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,270
Besides, I spoke ill about you

455
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,990
in front of him all the time.

456
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,030
Don't be silly.

457
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,630
I'm...

458
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,290
You knew about it, didn't you?

459
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,620
That's why you could deny that

460
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,990
you're Mr Fox

461
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,870
in such a strong way.

462
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,710
I've been busting my ass to sell your book

463
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,590
and yet you and Mr Jiang chose to

464
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,590
keep this huge secret hidden from me.

465
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,710
Don't you feel ashamed at all?

466
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,790
I...

467
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,110
What did I know?

468
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,550
No wonder.

469
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,550
Even though I told him I like Mr Fox,

470
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,270
he wouldn't stop pursuing me.

471
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,830
Turns out they are the same person.

472
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,430
Which means we like each other then.

473
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,190
Are you...

474
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,910
You used to think that I'm Mr Fox,

475
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,670
how come

476
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,730
you never thought we like each other?

477
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,750
Didn't we sleep together

478
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,830
when we were drunk?

479
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,910
We agreed

480
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,350
not to mention it again!

481
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,310
Besides, unlike Mr Jiang,

482
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,970
you've never confessed to me.

483
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,990
Right!

484
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,310
So you're far too excited

485
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,510
to sleep now, is it?

486
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,350
You're going to

487
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,590
confess to Jiang Yu Cheng tomorrow

488
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,110
and tell him you like him, is it?

489
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,270
This...

490
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,050
Why are you getting all worked up?

491
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,990
Where are you going at this hour?

492
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,670
Who is it?

493
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,780
Jiang Yu Cheng!

494
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,430
What did you tell Chu Li behind my back?

495
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,560
She's so convinced that you're Mr Fox!

496
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,430
I have no idea.

497
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,790
She didn't ask my anything.

498
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,420
She went for a movie with you and

499
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,230
came back convinced that you're Mr Fox.

500
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,750
It's not like the old days

501
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,910
where you can just swap in

502
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,430
and pretend to be me.

503
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,900
Calm down.

504
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,550
I didn't get to tell

505
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,510
Chu Li anything

506
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,390
before you came with Gu Bai Zhi.

507
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,070
I...

508
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:03,990
I don't care!

509
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,430
I want an explanation!

510
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,300
What's the reason?

511
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,120
When you went to get your car...

512
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,830
You've known Mr Fox for three years

513
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,960
and you've never met him in person too.

514
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,660
She's never told me

515
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,390
how long you've known each other.

516
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,740
Could it be because of this?

517
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,190
Jiang Yu Cheng, did you do it on purpose?

518
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,520
So that she'll think you're Mr Fox?

519
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,030
Do you think I'd do that?

520
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,550
I'd never win her heart even if I did.

521
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,470
She thinks you're Mr Fox now

522
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,950
and we're just messing with her.

523
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,830
Not only am I replaced by you,

524
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,830
I also become your partner in crime.

525
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,670
You're not my partner in crime.

526
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,260
You're the main perpetrator.

527
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,670
Aren't you Mr Fox?

528
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,900
I'm the innocent one here.

529
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,910
Why don't I go talk to her
and clear up the misconceptions?

530
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,870
If I choose to confess,

531
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,310
it will work in my favour.

532
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,430
No! How dare you!

533
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,230
If Chu Li were to ask

534
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,350
if you're Mr Fox,

535
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,870
you must never admit it!

536
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,830
Understand?

537
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,950
No.

538
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,020
Enjoy your food.

539
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,460
I have to go somewhere.

540
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,060
Where are you going so early?

541
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,150
Sit down.

542
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,990
Sir,

543
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,500
the Book of Luo He God launch day.

544
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,790
Don't you want to take a look?

545
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,110
No.

546
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,030
It's so crowded. Why should I?

547
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,150
To see how well your books are sold.

548
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,590
I'm not going.

549
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,620
You want breakfast?

550
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,350
Cut it out.

551
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,950
I know what you're thinking.

552
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,390
You're still wondering if

553
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,120
Jiang Yu Cheng is Mr Fox, right?

554
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,390
Did you ask him in person?

555
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,270
Not yet.

556
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,510
I feel perturbed.

557
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,740
What if

558
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,750
he really is Mr Fox?

559
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,430
You think this is a gashapon machine?

560
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,550
Insert a coin and you'll get a boyfriend

561
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,950
who is tall and handsome?

562
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,510
Jiang Yu Cheng is 33 years old,

563
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,840
pushing toward his 40s.

564
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,670
Do you know what it's like?

565
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,630
It means when you were

566
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,070
just a baby waiting to be fed,

567
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,660
he was already learning
300 Tang Poems in school.

568
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,630
What boyfriend?

569
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,030
Do you still wish to deny it?

570
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,490
Why are you blushing then?

571
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,590
Give him a call right now

572
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,720
and clear things up.

573
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,510
No need.

574
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,190
Mr Jiang and I are going to

575
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,190
meet at his house to talk about this.

576
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,150
His house?

577
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,710
Do you know where he lives?

578
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,840
I can give you a lift.

579
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,830
He sent me the address.

580
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,710
I can go by myself.

581
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,430
Bye.

582
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,070
I...

583
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,870
You're here.

584
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,150
Come in.

585
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,030
Thanks, Mr Jiang.

586
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,070
When I heard you on the phone,

587
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,710
I thought I had interrupted your rest.

588
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,480
I didn't sleep well last night.

589
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,510
Have a seat.

590
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,230
Sir,

591
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,230
I've got a question for you.

592
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,510
Are you

593
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,750
Mr Fox?

594
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,550
This won't do.

595
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,550
Chu Li is a sitting duck.

596
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,550
If Jiang decides

597
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,510
to admit that he's Mr Fox,

598
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,030
what am I going to do then?

599
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,660
Or, if he tells Chu Li

600
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,910
that I'm Mr Fox,

601
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,790
things will get
even more difficult for me.

602
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,590
Chu Li is going to hate me so much.

603
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,110
You think it's risky too, right?

604
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,670
That's what I thought!

605
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,550
This won't do.

606
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,950
I need to check on her.

607
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,370

609
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,850
[Little Monkey]

610
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,950
Thank you.

612
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,530
[Saviour]

613
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,110
[Why would you think]

614
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,230
[that I'm Mr Fox?]

615
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,550
I've never told you that

616
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,030
[I've known Mr Fox for three years]

617
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,270
but you blurted it out yesterday.

618
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,350
Chu Li,

619
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,110
what are you going to do

620
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,070
if I'm really Mr Fox?

621
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,620
I told you before,

622
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,150
I like Mr Fox.

623
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,140
[And if you're Mr Fox,]

624
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,230
[I have to...]

625
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,030
Get together with me?

626
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,510
[What is Jiang Yu Cheng trying to do?]

627
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,490
[Saviour]

628
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,950
It got disconnected?

629
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,810
[Little Monkey]

630
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,630
[Hello.]

631
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,160
[The number you've dialled
is unavailable.]

632
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,670
Your words

633
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,790
are tempting me into

634
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,250
admitting that I'm Mr Fox.

635
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,430
But I don't want to lie to you.

636
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,110
I'm not.

637
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,190
How did you know

638
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,670
about Mr Fox and me then?

639
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,010
I saw your post on Weibo last year.

640
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,230
You talked about an online friend

641
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,030
that you've known for two years.

642
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,340
I see.

643
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,670
If you like a girl,

644
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,710
you want to know everything about her.

645
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,190
But I've never thought about

646
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,140
pretending to be someone else

647
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,550
to win your favour.

648
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,390
Besides, you'll know who

649
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,790
Mr Fox is sooner or later.

650
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,510
What's that supposed to mean?

651
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,140
Chu Li,

652
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,110
are you rather disappointed

653
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,910
or happy when you know that

654
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,270
I'm not Mr Fox?

655
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,470
Mr Jiang,

656
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,110
whether you're Mr Fox or not,

657
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,240
you'll always be my favourite author.

658
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,750
Jiang Yu Cheng.

659
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,740
Are you out of your mind?

660
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,310
What do you mean she has to
get together with you?

661
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,350
You're a punk! Scumbag! Little rat!

662
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,390
Try the coffee.

663
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,630
He hung up on me?

664
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,870
Too late. She left already.

665
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,350
I'm not here looking for her.

666
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm here because of you.

667
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,830
I told her everything.

668
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,110
That's bad, Little Zhou.

669
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,030
It's too light.
You can't even kill a mosquito.

670
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,490
Let me show you how to do it.

671
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,750
Great.

672
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,110
Okay.

673
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,310
Go on.

674
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,790
Come on.

675
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,100
You should go all out too.

676
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,670
Sure. Come on.

677
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,140
I'll show you a trick.

678
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,110
Flying Scissors Kick!

679
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,060
Pressing from above!

680
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,190
Time out.

681
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,260
I'm exhausted.

682
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,150
I have to take the call.

683
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,030
Hello?

684
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,380
[Hi, sir.]

685
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,700
[I'm calling from Fitness Center.]

686
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,830
[We're having promotion now.]

687
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,430
[Are you interested?]

688
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,870
No!

689
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,270
Who's that?

690
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,750
Cold call.

691
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,510
Well?

692
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,370
Shall we continue?

693
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,120
Let me drink some water.

694
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,640
Have you ever thought of

695
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,470
the reason why you
always get all worked up

696
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,950
when Chu Li is involved?

697
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,070
Never.

698
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,590
I told her

699
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,230
I'm not Mr Fox.

700
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,659
You like Chu Li, right?

701
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,670
I don't know.

702
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,670
You're stubborn.

703
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,710
You need a good beating.

704
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,420
Well then, let's do it again.

705
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,469
I want a drink too.

706
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,310
I'm out.

707
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,909
From now onward,

708
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,159
Chu Li is nothing but an editor.

709
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,750
Why did you come round
to the idea all of a sudden?

710
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,750
You're my little brother after all.

711
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,750
A piece of advice for you.

712
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,990
You better tell Chu Li earlier

713
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,350
that you're Mr Fox.

714
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,510
It will not end well if she

715
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,910
were to figure it out.

716
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,750
Clean up

717
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,110
the blood on your lips.

718
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,080
Here, you should clean up too.

719
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,190
You're back.

720
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,980
Are you

721
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,230
injured?

722
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,350
Who did you fight with?

723
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,870
I slipped and fell over.

724
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,430
Seems like you landed on your face.

725
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,070
It hurts, right?

726
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,140
You deserve it for fighting.

727
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,830
Are you punishing me right now?

728
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,030
I'm teaching you on behalf of your mother.

729
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,610
Aren't you acting like Mama Duck?

730
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,310
You did it on purpose.

731
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,100
You take it out on me

732
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,560
now that you know Jiang Yu Cheng
isn't Mr Fox.

733
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,070
How did you know he's not Mr Fox?

734
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,870
I made a guess.

735
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,030
Why?

736
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,550
Are you sad that

737
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,940
he's not?

738
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,830
I've mistaken two people for him,

739
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,230
shouldn't I be sad?

740
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,830
Actually,

741
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,310
I...

742
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,380
Forget it, I don't care now.

743
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,790
Maybe you were right.

744
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,460
He's just a kid

745
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,510
who's still in school.

746
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,620
By the way,

747
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,330
when are you going home
for Chinese New Year?

748
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,140
Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,630
That's great! We still have time.

750
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,270
Let's sign

751
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,130
the contract after the book fair.

752
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,710
You seem so eager to do that.

753
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,470
I just can't wait to go home.

00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,150
You like Chinese New Year?

755
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,190
Of course!

756
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,710

757
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,270

lots of fish and meat

760

and Eight Treasure Rice

761
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,110

765
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,510
Our company still cares about

766
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,910
the Book of Luo He God a lot

767
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,830
that they decide to
release the book today.

00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,510
Look at the slogan.

770
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,870

Maurer?

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,550
Xin Dun Books has invited Maurer.

782
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,990
Half an hour signing session
for Un Oiseau Effray E.

783
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,750
Aside from Un Oiseau Effray E,

784
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,710
Maurer will release two other

785
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,500
movie-to-book adaptations worldwide.

786
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,470
The books are translated
into 16 languages.

787
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,130
Xin Dun Books has already bought
the copyright of one of the books.

788
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,070
If Zhou Chuan knows that

789
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,530
Maurer's display board
is right next to his,

790
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,730
he'd be so happy that
he'll write 30,000 words a day.

791
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,310
Mr Zhou Chuan has
great respect for Maurer.

792
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,390
He's totally obsessed with him.

793
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,230
He can recite

794
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,310
all the lines from two movies.

795
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,710
One of them is Lion King.

796
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,740
And the other one

797
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,380
is Maurer's movie, Virgo.

798
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,990
Every time he travels abroad,

799
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,670
he will look for Maurer's CDs.

800
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,750
He has a drawer full of his CDs

801
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,070
under his TV cabinet.

802
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,150
How come she knows so much

803
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,750
about Mr Zhou Chuan's house?

804
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,990
He's the type of guy

805
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,540
who will keep his thought to himself

806
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,140
no matter how much
he likes or admires someone.

807
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,890
He's pretentious.

808
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,730
Hard to get along with.

809
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,780
I guess that's the way he was raised.

810
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,470
He wouldn't even eat the apple

811
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,910
unless you make

812
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,170
a bunny shape out of it.

813
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,700
He's not pretentious!

814
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,750
Talented people

815
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,270
always happen to be eccentric.

816
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,670
He's quite interesting.

817
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,230
I hope we will have
the chance to become teammates

818
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,630
instead of opponents.

819
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,860
How come she knows
everything about Mr Zhou Chuan?

820
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,380
She's not necessarily telling the truth.

821
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,110
Touché.

822
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,950
But did she just ask you
to join Xin Dun Books?

823
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,750
I'm not going to check if

824
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,280
there are CDs in his drawer.

825
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,630
So what if he has a drawer full of CDs?

826
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,790
I know Drama King

827
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,550
likes to sleep with soft toys too.

828
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,620
I won't do anything to find out

829
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,880
if he really likes bunny-shaped apples.

830
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,910
What am I doing?

831
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,390
I've been acting strange lately.

832
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:06,990
Mr...

833
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,940
Mr Zhou Chuan.

834
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,390
Well,

835
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,780
Xin Dun Books has invited Mr Maurer

836
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,350
to the signing session
for Un Oiseau Effray E

837
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,070
on your launch day.

838
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,380
He'll be there for half an hour.

839
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,310
Is that so?

840
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,710
You're so calm.

841
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,870
Did your previous editor

842
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,590
not tell you about it?

843
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,670
Mr Liang

844
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,820
suggested that we should hire
the Internet Water Army

845
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,230
to come and buy your books

846
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,900
with their arms flailing in the air.

847
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,590
Just to put up a front.

848
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,710
But you might need to pay for it.

849
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,510
What are you hiding?

850
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,950
Nothing.

851
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,550
Take it out.

852
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,510
This is good.

853
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,190
So sweet.

854
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,550
Do you really like

855
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,310
bunny-shaped apples?

856
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,630
What do you mean?

857
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,990
It's just an apple.

858
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,430
What's with the face?

859
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,310
It looks as though

860
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,870
I did something wrong to you.

861
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,030
The apples that I prepared for you before

862
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,420
are not apples, are they?

863
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,990
Besides, did I ever say that

864
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,510
these apples are for you?

865
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,750
Who is this for if it weren't for me?

866
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,830
Er Gou?

867
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,070
It only eats meat.

868
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,550
I prepared this for myself.

869
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,510
Is that so?

870
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,510
How delicate.

871
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,230
These are all for me!

872
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,910
I won't give you any of them!

873
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,460
Fine, it's all yours.

874
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,320
It's all yours.

875
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,190
How did you know

876
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,990
that I like bunny-shaped apple?

877
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,430
I didn't know about that.

878
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,350
These apples

879
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,070
are prepared for myself.

880
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,710
Director Gu told me about this.

881
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,510
And she said you have
a drawer full of CDs.

882
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,940
What's that look?

883
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,910
Are you jealous?

884
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,710
No way!

885
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,190
I'm not jealous.

886
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,030
She's just your former editor,

887
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,990
not your ex-girlfriend.

888
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,910
Even if she's your ex-girlfriend,

889
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,910
that's none of my business.

890
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,310
I'm your current editor.

891
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,170
Why did you tell her instead of me?

892
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,320
I didn't tell her about it.

893
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,190
She knew it from that big mouth,
Jiang Yu Cheng.

894
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,190
Mr Jiang?

895
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,430
Well then...

896
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,700
Mr Zhou Chuan,

897
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,670
you can eat as much as you like.

898
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,590
What else do you want to know?

899
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,050
I'll say everything I know
without reserve.

900
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,350
What's your favourite colour?

901
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,470
Black.

902
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,310
What's your favourite number?

903
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:03,910
13.
