He's been away looking for
inspirations and can't make it back,

to promote my book.

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,460
So it's only polite and reasonable that

92
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,780
I should go.

At the end, we decided
to give you a promise.

We promise that we will
take our job very seriously.

it is also necessary to
make proper concessions.

to gain more readers too.

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,340
Xiao Niao.

189
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,310
Mr Xia.

190
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,590
The better you do your job,

191
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,060
the more you understand
the importance of editing.

192
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,590
I believe that you will be able to

193
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,910
walk longer and farther on this path.

194
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,510
Keep it up.

195
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,270
I'll keep that in mind, Mr Xia.

196
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,340
Xian Xian,

197
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,030
the flowers and plants in my office

198
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,870
are now yours, remember to water them.

199
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,710
Don't let them die.

200
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,260
Mr Xia,

201
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,670
you are trying to chain me to Yuan Yue.

202
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,590
You need attachments, otherwise,

203
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,990
you are going to send
the leave application

204
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,630
to the office the second
I walk out of the door.

205
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,390
Chu Li,

206
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,150
for you,

207
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,580
I have nothing more to advise you.

208
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,510
You are growing so fast,

209
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,470
faster than I expected.

210
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,950
I'm very proud that Yuan Yue

211
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,910
has produced

212
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,940
another great editor.

213
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,990
Always remember to protect

214
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,990
and respect your writer.

215
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,630
Yu Yao,

216
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,190
all these years, I've been
feeling guilty toward you.

217
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,550
You've done so much for Yuan Yue,

218
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,990
you even sacrificed your family.

219
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,590
I've always regretted

220
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,110
appointing you as the chief editor.

221
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,230
I often ask myself

222
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,150
if my selfishness

223
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,430
has wronged you.

224
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,630
But I really can't find a person

225
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,740
who's more suitable than you.

226
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,710
I can only trust you

227
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,650
with Moonlight Magazine.

228
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,710
I've wronged you.

229
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,460
You didn't, Mr Xia.

230
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,110
It's you who

231
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,590
got Yuan Yue Publishing House
to where it is now.

232
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,710
You were the one

233
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,870
who brought me into
Yuan Yue Publishing House

234
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,700
and made me a part of it.

235
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,430
This is the proudest thing

236
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,150
I've ever done in my life.

237
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,430
Don't worry,

238
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,790
I'll take care of Yuan Yue,
take care of Moonlight Magazine.

239
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,430
I'll make sure everyone

240
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,230
passes on your belief.

241
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,510
Good.

243
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,950
the proudest and the luckiest thing

244
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,310
I've got in my life

245
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,790
is this job.

246
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,870
I got to read a lifetime of books.

247
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,150
With books as my companion

248
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,710
in all my life, I couldn't ask for more.

249
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,910
Everyone,

250
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,790
I'll leave Yuan Yue in
your good hands now.

251
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,510
You can count on us, Mr Xia.

252

what are you doing here?

257
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,270
I have to come.

I'm here to invite you to play
chess and drink tea with me.

259
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,430
It's been so many years,
we are old friends now.

260
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,590
Although you are retired now,

261
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,430
that doesn't mean you're getting rid

262
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,630
of all of our writers here.

263
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,190
You're right, thank you. Thank you.

264
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,870
Xia, if you hadn't encouraged me

265
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,100
not to give up on writing poems,

266
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,990
I wouldn't be here today.

267
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,310
Don't say it like that.

268
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,110
As an editor, when I
spot an author's talent,

269
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,270
I will definitely support him.

270
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,390
Yes.

271

272
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,390
Zhou Chuan,

273
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,990
being able to witness Yuan Yue

274
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,150
to get the Huazhi Award before I retired,

275
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,950
thank you for that.

276
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,950
It's me who has to thank you.

277
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,630
I heard my father say that

278
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,590
he always thought it's a
pity that Time Is Like A Song

279
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,270
didn't get the award.

280
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,310

before you retired

282
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,140

this award

287
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,120
isn't just a personal honour to me,

288
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,590
but it's also my admiration
for editors like you

289
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,590
who have dedicated

290
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,630
most of your life
in the frontline of publishing.

important place in my house.

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,100
data plays only the smallest part

has become a norm in many websites.

373
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,630
♫ Guileless adults are reduced to a joke ♫

374
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,630
I look forward to not
being alone in the future.

375
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:10,900
♫ Unceasingly, here to stay ♫

376
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,430
I'd like to open the window of my heart

377
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,140
to feel the smell of wind,

378
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:18,000
♫ No dancing on the roof, but rain ♫

379
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,470
the melody of rain,

380
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,870
the temperature of snow.

381
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:26,050
♫ To always be a source of warmth
just for you ♫

382
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,190
From now on,

383
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,430
the cat on the street,

384
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,790
the stranger I meet on the road,

385
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:33,980
♫ A mysterious weakness, came into being ♫

386
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,310
and the words I write,

387
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,990
I wish

388
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,670
to have your hand in mine.

389
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:41,390
♫ Melting, chewing ♫

390
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:49,270
♫ There's no hiding at the dining table.
There's only our joined souls ♫

391
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,190
I wish

392
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,590
I could spend my whole life with you.

393
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,900
♫ I've been giddy from drifting
in a sea of people ♫

394
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,950
Gu Bai Zhi...

395
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:07,790
♫ Unwilling to admit my anticipation
of getting submitted to gentleness ♫

396
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,910
Let's get married.

397
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:15,150
♫ I want to be led by you,
albeit a meager freedom ♫

398
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:21,980
♫ The Hand of the Creator has finally seen to ♫

399
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:29,680
♫ I'm drifting in a sea of people.
And will frequently look back♫

400
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:37,560
♫ Scared to reach out my hand
that no one will save me ♫

401
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,390
Do you like ginkgoes?

402
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:45,010
♫ How rich can concrete skyscrapers be ♫

403
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,910
I do.

404
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,230
♫ You are a rare shining oasis ♫

405
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:56,930
♫ Exactly what I want ♫

406
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,430
Coming.

407
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,230
Jiang Yu Cheng,

408
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,700
I've found a few more proposal ideas.

409
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,230
Take a look for me.

410
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,470
A nice one I found is

411
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,030
outdoor large LED screen proposal.

412
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,490
What do you think about it?

413
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,110
This idea won't work, it's too grandiose.

414
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,750
Grandiose?

415
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,550
Why don't you help me
take a look at other ideas?

416
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,230
Relax.

417
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,310
Let me tell you,

418
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,030
this sort of thing,

419
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,980
you just have to go with the flow

420
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,110
and everything will work out naturally.

421
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,750
You don't understand this, do you?

422
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,270
Just go with the flow?

423
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,700
I'd like to see how long
is it going to take until

424
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,950
Gu Bai Zhi agrees to marry you
if you keep going with the flow.

425
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,510
Who called me?

426
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,750
Gu Bai Zhi?

427
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,270
Well, sorry about this,

428
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,150
but I've

429
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,580
won again.

430
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,070
Jiang Yu Cheng,

431
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,150
it's just a marriage proposal.

432
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,990
Why is he so smug about it?

433
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,910
Anybody can do it.

434
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,590
Er Gou,

435
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,320
my happiness lies in your hand.

436
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,700
Don't drop the ball later.

437
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,670
Come.

438
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,820
Come here, put this on.

439
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,190
Listen,

440
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,430
come to me

441
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,350
when I do this later, got it?

442
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,860
Got it?

443
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,790
I'm home!

444
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,910
Go and hide now, go!

445
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,870
I'm here.

446
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,390
Why are you so romantic today?

447
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,710
Eating in the courtyard?

448
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,950
You don't like it?

449
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,430
No, no, I like it.

450
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,150
I taught Er Gou a new skill today.

451
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,220
Let me show you.

452
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,630
Er Gou.

453
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,110
Er Gou.

454
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,990
Why isn't he coming?

455
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,550
Forget it, never mind.

456
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,550
I'll watch it later when I go inside.

457
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,790
I have something to tell you. I...

458
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,740
Sorry, there's a mosquito.

459
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,870
Maybe we should

460
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,110
move our dinner inside.

461
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,750
Sure.

462
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,910
What were you trying to tell me just now?

463
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,870
I was going to say...

464
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,510
New Year's Day is coming.

465
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,780
Where would you like to
celebrate New Year's Eve?

466
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,390
Anywhere is fine, you can arrange it.

467
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,950
Use mine first.

468
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,470
Why is it gone?

469
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,590
What's gone?

470
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,430
Nothing,

471
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,790
just the two new books I bought.

472
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,470
I can't find it.

473
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,950
Don't wait for me.

474
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,710
Let me help you look for it.

475
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,070
It's okay.

476
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,750
Why don't you

477
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,510
check the room?

478
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,110
It's two new unopened books.

479
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,150
Okay.

480
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,270
Er Gou,

481
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,790
you really picked the right time

482
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,270
to drop the ball.

483
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,830
This is so hard for me.

484
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,230
I'm going to work now.
Today's New Year's Eve.

485
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,510
We're having after work
party tonight. Don't wait up.

486
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,940
Where's the venue?

487
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,030
I'll go pick you up.

488
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,070
That's fine, it's near our place.

489
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,150
What time will you be back?

490
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,360
It doesn't matter. She'll have to
come back sooner or later anyway.

491
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,510
Boss, do you have
a newer one for this book?

492
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,350
Hello, Sis Yao Yao,

493
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,110
I'll be there soon.

494
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,590
Don't worry.

495
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,310
Okay.

496
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,100
What's with the attitude?

497
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,990
Okay, see you.

498
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,510
What's with the attitude?

499
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,270
Suo Heng.

500
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,110
Deputy Editor Miao.

501
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,630
Cut it out.

502
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,910
I'm no longer Deputy Editor Miao.

503
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,990
Seeing how I'm doing now,

504
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,940
have you done enjoying the show?

505
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,470
Have you got some satisfaction now?

506
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,430
Just go.

507
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,510
Miao,

508
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,150
actually, I don't really hate you.

509
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,190
But I just want to tell you that,

510
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,850
despite you are both editors,

511
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,990
do you know what the big difference

512
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,390
between you and Chu Li is?

513
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,030
Stop bringing up Chu Li in front of me.

514
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,350
You know that she bugs me.

515
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,070
Chu Li is an editor who can

516
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,070
really see the best in writers.

517
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,710
I don't need to see your best.

518
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,790
I'm not a teacher.

519
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,990
It's not my job to cultivate you.

520
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,230
I was just an editor.

521
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,310
If you write a good book,

522
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,870
my job is to sell it for money.

523
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,870
Yes, for money.

524
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,950
All you care is money.

525
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,630
That's why you forced me

526
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,260
to write about subjects
I wasn't good at back then,

527
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,150
you made me lose myself.

528
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,630
But it was Chu Li

529
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,030
who found what I do best,

530
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,630
and that's the only way I could
accomplish a longer journey,

531
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,070
do you understand?

532
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,550
Miao,

533
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,680
for the sake of our previous partnership,

534
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,380
I would like to give you a word of advice.

535
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,030
Knowing how to respect people's dream

536
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,190
is what really matters.

537
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:52,790
[Marry me]

538
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,640
[Marry him]

539
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,510
Be on your best performance later.

540
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm counting on you.

541
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,550
Thank you for your hard work.

542
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,710
Has everyone got their ride?

543
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,630
Yes.

544
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,310
Xiao Niao's boyfriend has picked her up.

545
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,510
Sis Xian Xian will drive Ah Xiang home.

546
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,710
Get in the car, I'll drive you home.

547
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,270
It's okay.

548
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,830
I'd like to take a walk and get some air.

549
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,620
Sure, text me when you get home.

550
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,990
Okay, bye bye.

551
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,150
Bye.

552
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,110
I can't drink too much like this again.

553
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,030
Sis Yao Yao, it's New Year's Eve.

554
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,790
Do you have any wish?

555
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,230
Wish?

556
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,750
I wish that the reform of our

557
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,070
Yuan Yue Publishing House goes smoothly.

558
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,510
I mean your own wish.

559
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,040
Nothing to do with
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

560
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,350
Are you really going to the
spend the rest of your life alone?

561
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,390
Ever thought of finding a man?

562
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,710
He can take care of Qiu Qiu for you too.

563
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,390
No.

564
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,750
You know that

565
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,470
I can't balance

566
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,030
my career and family.

567
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,190
Yuan Yue Publishing House
is going through a reformation now.

568
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,310
It needs me.

569
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,750
And I don't have time to find a man.

570
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,390
Even if I do find one,

571
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,300
it's still unfair for him.

572
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,430
What's all this talk about?

573
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,790
I just think that

574
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,830
you've been alone for a long time,

575
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,710
and you don't know how
to take care of yourself.

576
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,910
You need to get yourself a good husband.

577
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,510
How should I put this?

578
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,750
The meaning of work to me is
like the meaning of writing to you.

579
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,190
To others, it may seem
exhausting, stressful,

580
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,790
and hard,

581
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,030
but only I myself know that

582
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,429
it brings me happiness.

583
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,060
Of course, you know that too.

584
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,030
I believe that being able to find a job

585
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,179
that you like in life

586
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,550
is more important and precious

587
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,670
than finding a compatible partner.

588
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,949
So I don't ask for it,

589
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,710
and I won't ask for it.

590
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,150
I hear you.

591
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,540
What's going on?

592
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,190
[I used to think that]

593
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,110
[writing alone]

594
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,430
♫ Dream flies above the horizon ♫

595
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,350
[and living alone]

596
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,790
[was not a big deal to me.]

597
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:46,730
♫ Night asks for dawn to come ♫

598
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,070
[Until an accident]

599
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,110
[barged into my life like a bandit.]

600
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,680
♫ Yet I'm still here ♫

601
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:58,460
♫ Waiting for a mapless journey ♫

602
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,120
[I heard applause that
I've never heard before.]

603
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,480
[I was infected by her cheerfulness.]

604
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,260
[She made me feel like
I'm an incredible hero.]

605
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:07,160
♫ The stillness you stirred ♫

606
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,070
[I got company that
I've never had before.]

607
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:14,880
♫ Fear is forgotten and
so is that time on the rooftop ♫

608
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,430
[In each of the nights that
I believe was freezingly cold,]

609
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,910
[she stood on tiptoe]

610
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,790
[to light up the swaying lamp for me,]

611
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:22,220
♫ Every footprint turns into
a stubborn silhouette ♫

612
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,410
[she waited with me for the dawn to come.]

613
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,150
[So sometime, somehow,]

614
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,360
♫ Nobody wants to be the first
to let their heart sway ♫

615
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,880
[suddenly I didn't want
to be alone anymore.]

616
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,190
[Like a plant that grows in dark corner,]

617
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,710
[once it sees the sun,]

618
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,860
♫ The wind quietly brought in a letter ♫

619
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,240
[it grows toward the sun from then on.]

620
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,110
[The moment]

621
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,590
[I made up my mind,]

622
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,300
♫ It tells that meetings and partings ♫

623
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:41,190
[my heart is calm, yet burning hot.]

624
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,040
♫ Are to carry on the eternal light ♫

625
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:47,630
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

626
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:50,270
♫ Glaring thoughts should not be heard ♫

627
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:53,230
five, four, three, two, one.

628
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,490
♫ Hide in a corner away from the light ♫

629
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,350
Happy new year!

630
00:36:54,490 --> 00:37:02,190
♫ Waiting for you to come ♫

631
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,190
[I want to keep my sun by my side.]

632
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,470
[With a lifetime]

633
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,310
[as the unit of time.]

634
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,590
Will you marry me?

635
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,220
♫ I'm willing to make an eternal promise ♫

636
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,890
♫ Be the rotating star ♫

637
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:39,590
♫ Changing the life from
gloomy to crystal-clear ♫

I'm off to work, see you.

641
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,790
Say goodbye to mummy, come on.

642
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,700
Bye bye.

643
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,390
[Two years later,]

644
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,990
[I'm still working for
Yuan Yue Publishing House.]

645
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,030
[I once took the first step of my dream]

646
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,060
-[in this same room,]
-Hi, Chief Editor Chu.

647
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,430
[but now]

648
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,850
[Conference Room]

649
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,910
[I'm leading others]

650
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,750
[to take theirs.]

651
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,750
Hi, I'm the chief editor
of Moonlight Magazine,

652
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,790
Chu Li.

653
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,830
Hi, Chief Editor.

654
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,830
You can relax.

655
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,110
People in our second section
are all very friendly.

656
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,630
I'm not nervous,

657
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,220
I'm just really thrilled.

658
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,070
I never thought I would
actually be hired by Yuan Yue.

659
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,330
This has been
my dream since I was a child.

660
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,470
Come with me.

661
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,910
-[People come and go in Yuan Yue.]
-Hi, Chief Editor Yu.

662
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,630
[We have many new faces here now,]

663
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,740
[but fortunately,]

664
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,590
[all my old friends are still here.]

665
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,790
Executive Editor Yu.

666
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,630
This is the new editor
who just joined us today,

667
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,870
Zhang Si Jia.

668
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,540
This is our executive editor, Yu Yao.

669
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,150
Hello, Executive Director Yu.

670
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,350
Si Jia,

671
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,950
ask the chief editor
if  you have any questions.

672
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,990
I'll be away on leave for a while.

673
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,900
Suo Heng and I are bringing
Qiu Qiu to northwest region

674
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,790
for a tree-planting campaign.

675
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,190
I'll leave things to you now.

676
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,030
You can count on me, Executive Editor.

677
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,990
By the way, I heard that TV adaptation

678
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,650
of Ms Suo Heng's novel
is already in production.

679
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,550
That's wonderful.

680
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,390
Yes.

681
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,030
It's a good thing we didn't
give up on her back then.

682
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,360
And it all thanks to you.

683
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,390
All right, I'm going to get back to work.

684
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,270
Come on.

685
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,470
Hi, Chief Editor Chu.

686
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,310
Chief Editor, these are
the serialization agreements

You have to come.

693
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,990
The one just now

694
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,860
is a long-time editor in our team.

695

If you have any questions,
you can consult her.

696
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,710

And there is me too.

698
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,510
Assign a seat for me with Si Jia.

699
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,750
Ah Xiang, today is

700
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,070
your last day here.

701

You're the one I'll miss the most.

702
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,300
Silly.

703
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,670
You are now a super famous illustrator.

704
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,950
There are still many opportunities

705
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,590
for us to work together in the future.

706
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,350
Please remember to give priority

707
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,480
to drawing the book cover for
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

708
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,350
You got it.

709
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,900
Did you hear that?

710
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,340
You might be the one to make appointment

711
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,540
for book cover illustration in the future.

712
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,270
I promise I'll get the job done.

713
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,750
I'm going now.

714
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,830
Bye bye.

715
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,270
Chief Editor, I have proofread

716
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,510
next month's serials of
the three authors on my side.

717
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,030
Deputy Editor Li,

718
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,470
you're the first again this month.

719
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,670

720
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,140
This is Deputy Editor Li.

721
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,700
Hi, Deputy Editor.

722
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,630
Hi.

723
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,230
Proofreading and badgering writer are two
of the most difficult tasks for editor.

724
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,690
You have a lot to learn
from Deputy Editor Li.

725
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,990
Noted.

726
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,830
So you...

727
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,590
You can sit here.

728
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,390

730
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,830
I've read Ghost's latest novel.

731
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,790
It's brilliant, do you want to sell to me?

732
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,320
I can get the best team to
make a TV adaptation.

733

736
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,990
[comrades and friends.]

737
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:43,650
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

738
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,710
[And every time I see the words
"Yuan Yue Publishing House",]

739
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,660
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

740
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,660
[I'd still be reminded
of Mr Xia's teachings.]

741
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,110
[Keep our promise, don't let others down.]

742
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,680
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

743
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,540
Doggie is coming here.

744
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,350
Give this to him, come on.

745
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,830
Here we go.

746
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,510
Er Gou.

747
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,950
Take care of your sister, Er Gou.

748
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,220
Turn over.

749
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,950
Check out the doggie.

750
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,110
Playing with child can be tiring.

751
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,710
I appreciate your hard work.

752
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,110
I brought you here to take a break,

753
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,710
why are you reading again?

754
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,190
I'm at the part where the female lead
has her first job interview,

755
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,470
and the male lead yells
in the editorial department

756
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,270
30,000 copies to test the water?

757
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,710
Did you tell Ghost

758
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,910
everything?

759
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,390
Looks like

760
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,150
Ghost did process things

761
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,820
when she wrote this.

762
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,550
At least she didn't include

763
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,610
your "do you think I'm a beggar" line.

764
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,510
I think this book

765
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,980
should be renamed as

766
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,990
Chu Li's Memoir.

767
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,630
But I think Moonlight

768
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,350
is a good name

769
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,630
for this book.

770
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,990
Over there.

771
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,390
Over here.

772
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:37,960
