[Episode 35]

4
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,310
Here's your coffee.

5
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,310
Have a seat.

6
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,870
Come on.

7
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,900
So,

8
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,150
I wasn't in my right mind last night.

9
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,430
Please don't take it to heart, okay?

10
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,940
Actually, I passed out last night.

11
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,580
I don't remember anything.

12
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,229
Uncle, the congee is almost ready.

13
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,229
Let me take a look.

14
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,700
Don't do that.

15
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,550
Sit down.

16
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,190
So,

17
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,430
who does the chores usually?

18
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,270
We'll take turns.

19
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,390
If Chu Li is cooking,

20
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,350
I'll be her assistant.

21
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,590
I'll wash the dishes or
cut the vegetables for her.

22
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,230
When it comes to cleaning the house
or folding our laundry,

23
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,630
we'll do them together.

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,270
That's right.

25
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,270
When you two are living together,

26
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,790
you two need to help each other out.

27
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,310
Of course.

28
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,640
Uncle, you don't need to worry about that.

29
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,870
This daughter of mine,

30
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,950
although

31
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,310
she isn't born with a silver spoon,

32
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,710
we did spoil her a little bit

33
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,140
since young.

34
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,710
That's good to hear.

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,970
Ladies are meant to be spoilt, am I right?

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,260
That's why

37
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,750
she isn't afraid

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,590
of anything.

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,910
You haven't seen her

40
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,150
when she was arguing

41
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,070
with children from the nearby area.

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,829
Our neighbours said that

43
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,790
she has a greater sense of justice

44
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,990
than the police dogs in our area.

45
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,350
I can imagine that scene.

46
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,470
In the future,

47
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,870
you need to stop her, okay?

48
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,430
Don't let her get in trouble all the time.

49
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,190
She doesn't know the limits
of her own capability.

50
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,270
Uncle, you see,

51
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,030
if you can't stop her,

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,590
I will never be able to stop her.

53
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,030
The key is, someone needs to protect her.

54
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,270
We need to let her know that

55
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,590
the sky will never

56
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,710
fall on her.

57
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,670
Even if the sky is falling,

58
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,830
someone needs to hold it up for her.

59
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,790
I understand.

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,470
I need to protect her when

61
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,600
she's trying to protect someone else.

62
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,390
In the past,

63
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,740
I was her guardian.

64
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,230
In the future, I'll be her guardian.

65
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,310
Is this Oath of the Peach Garden?

66
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,630
What nonsense are you saying?

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,550
It's nothing.

68
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,350
I was just afraid that

69
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,710
you want me to call your buddy
instead of Uncle.

70
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,590
Do your chores.

71
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,030
Dad, Mum,

72
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,190
why aren't you guys
staying for a few more days?

73
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,910
Yeah, you guys
should stay for a few more days.

74
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,540
It's not that. I still have things to do
in the police station.

75
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,430
We need to return early.

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,430
Come and visit us whenever you're free.

77
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,470
Uncle, Aunty, don't worry.

78
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,630
I will surely take good care of Chu Li.

79
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,110
Alright, we'll leave now.

80
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,950
-Alright.
-See you guys.

81
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,350
Goodbye, Dad, Mum.

82
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,030
Don't drink too much and
don't stay up late, okay?

83
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,510
I don't drink.

84
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,030
Alright.

85
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,270
Aunty, I'll keep an eye on her.

86
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,190
Alright.

87
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,620
You guys don't need to see us off.

88
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,470
Goodbye, Uncle, Aunty.

89
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,060
Let's go.

90
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,550
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

91
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,510
Let's go.

92
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,470
It's finally over.

93
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,670
Was it that scary for you?

94
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,390
Of course it was scary for me.

95
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,110
I was afraid they thought that
I was too old for you

96
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,230
or that I don't have a stable job.

97
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,950
I came up with all kinds of solutions,
you know?

98
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,230
What solutions?

99
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,510
If they think I'm too old for you,

100
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,230
I'll go for a facelift.

101
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,790
If they think I don't have a stable job,

102
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,590
I'll work for Jiang Yu Cheng.

103
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,230
With my looks,

104
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,150
I'm sure I'll be able to attract
some customers for him.

105
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,910
What?

106
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,470
Are you planning on stealing
Xiao Bai's job?

107
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,230
If I don't do it,

108
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,390
I won't be able to keep you by my side.

109
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,990
You're full of nonsense.

110
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,900
Go and do the dishes.

111
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,990
Alright.

112
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,550
Everyone,

113
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,150
I'll be leaving today.

114
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,070
See you when I see you.

115
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,750
Looks like you guys are quite free, huh?

116
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,470
I heard that you're going
to start a business.

117
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,130
How's the preparation going?

118
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,350
It's none of your business.

119
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,990
Bai Zhi,

120
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,390
if, one day, you feel like
returning to us,

121
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,070
Xin Dun Books will always
welcome your return.

122
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,790
Thanks, but no thanks.

123
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,550
Boss.

124
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,260
Seems like Xiao Tang still has
a great relationship with you.

125
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,190
She's still referring you as Boss.

126
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,870
She'll always be my boss.

127
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,070
Boss,

128
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,910
I've notified the HR department
regarding my resignation.

129
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,470
Have you made up your mind?

130
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,830
Xiao Tang, follow me.

131
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,030
Mr Luo, there's no need for that.

132
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,580
Sorry for the trouble.

133
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,350
And me.

134
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,110
Mr Luo,

135
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,940
this is the contract report
for the new book.

136
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,710
But, since my sister isn't working
for Xin Dun Books anymore,

137
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,640
I guess there's no need to
sign the contract anymore.

138
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,270
Yun Fei, you don't need to be anxious.

139
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,950
You should take your time
and reconsider this, okay?

140
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,820
Last year, you published the
Imperial Guard's Journal early.

141
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,150
Even now, I still remember what you did.

142
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,750
I would've left this company long ago

143
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,280
if it weren't for my sister.

144
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,750
If you want to spend that much effort
to keep me around,

145
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,870
why don't you use that effort
to try and keep the others around?

146
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,030
What do you mean?

147
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,830
Are they leaving as well?

148
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,510
Yeah.

149
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,630
It's been one week since
the Highly Recommended list

150
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,060
isn't as accurate as it used to be.

151
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,350
Mr Luo, I'm sure you know why.

152
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,870
Sister, let me ask you this.

153
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,190
Are you going to hire us?

154
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,950
But of course.

155
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,070
Gu Bai Zhi!

156
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,340
Luo Wen, I wish you luck.

157
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,500
Chu Li.

158
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,070
Are you done discussing the contract
regarding Zhou Chuan's new book?

159
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,390
Not yet.

160
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,789
You're not done with it yet?

161
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,470
Didn't I tell you that
we can negotiate this?

162
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,030
Mr Liang, it's not that
I didn't mention the contract to him.

163
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,390
But, whenever I mention it to him,

164
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,470
he'll shift the topic immediately.

165
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,590
Seems like he's not willing to
let us sign his new book.

166
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,510
Did you put in enough effort?

167
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,230
You see,

168
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,780
I can see if you've put in effort or not.

169
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,430
Am I right?

170
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,950
I know you're the best employee
of our company. That's a given.

171
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,070
But, sometimes,

172
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,310
you need to put in
more than just plain effort.

173
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,910
You need to apply some
special methods as well.

174
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,950
Chu Li,

175
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,270
I suddenly realized that
you actually look great.

176
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,180
You look like a girl

177
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,750
who can bring fortune to
everyone you meet.

178
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,140
You can be cool, sweet,

179
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,190
pure, and wild at the same time.

180
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,430
Let's not mention Zhou Chuan,

181
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,270
if I weren't

182
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,740
as old as I am right now,

183
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,790
I would've acknowledged you
as my elder sister.

184
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,790
You need to use this advantage of yours.

185
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,340
When you talk to him,

186
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,670
you need to create a relaxing atmosphere.

187
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,110
You can feel that,

188
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,910
am I right?

189
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,190
By doing so, Zhou Chuan

190
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,750
will agree to everything you say.

191
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,790
Mr Liang, are you saying that

192
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,390
you're willing to sponsor 500,000 copies
as the minimum number of printed copies?

193
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,630
How about 200,000 copies?

194
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,890
Alright, Mr Liang.
I will relay your message to him.

195
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,310
Chu Li.

196
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,910
Chu Li.

197
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,830
Here's some breakfast for you.

198
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,070
Take it.

199
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,580
Thank you, Mr Liang.

200
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,670
Remember,

201
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,670
girls who love breakfast are always lucky.

202
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,150
Fighting.

203
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,190
Buns?

204
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,150
Soy milk?

205
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,710
He thinks that I'll forget about
the 200,000 copies

206
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,430
just because he bought me
some buns and soy milk?

207
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,950
Liang Chong Lang, you old fox.

208
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,470
I finally understood how
Zhou Chuan felt back then.

209
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,550
I'm in no mood for breakfast.

210
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,790
Chen Cheng.

211
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,630
Mr Liang.

212
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,750
Buy me a set of breakfast.

213
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,410
Sir, didn't you bring breakfast
with you today?

214
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,590
Mr Liang.

215
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,110
Morning, Director Yang.

216
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,510
Director Yang, why are you here?

217
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,220
Have a seat.

218
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,190
I'm sure

219
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,670
you would've forgotten
what you were supposed to do

220
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,390
if I didn't come to the office.

221
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,470
Let me ask you this.

222
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,990
Have you managed to
sign Zhou Chuan's new book?

223
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,590
It's like this.

224
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,050
I've asked his managing editor
to follow up.

225
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,270
You think an editor

226
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,000
will be able to get the job done?

227
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,670
I've taught her

228
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,620
all kinds of methods.

229
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,550
I believe they'll be useful.

230
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,140
What kind of methods?

231
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,510
Just solid

232
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,670
negotiation techniques.

233
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,070
Xiao Liang,

234
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,510
it seems like you're not as
efficient as you were before.

235
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,190
If this happened in the past,

236
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,720
you would've visited
the writer personally.

237
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,430
Alright, Director Yang.
I understand what you mean.

238
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,150
I'll visit him personally today.

239
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,510
You must sign his new book
before the Huazhi Award.

240
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,990
I don't need to
tell you the details, do I?

241
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,310
I understand.

242
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,350
You better do your job well.

243
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,070
I have a question for you.

244
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,270
Do you still want to be the vice president
of the company?

245
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,350
Director Yang, I understand.

246
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,310
I'll do anything

247
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,780
for the sake of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

248
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,660
As for my position,

249
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,590
I don't think it's that important.

250
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,590
I'm relieved to hear that.

251
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,990
Take care.

252
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,390
See you, Director Yang.

253
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,870
Why are you still reading your book?

254
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,950
The award ceremony
will be held tomorrow night, you know?

255
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,830
Have you prepared your speech?

256
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,070
Just take a look at the previous
award winners.

257
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,990
You'll see that there's no need
to prepare anything.

258
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,830
And it doesn't matter

259
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,110
if I get the award or not.

260
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,470
Of course it matters.

261
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,150
The award ceremony
will be a live broadcast, you know?

262
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,630
The entire Yuan Yue Publishing House,

263
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,190
your parents, even my parents
will watch the ceremony.

264
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,520
You better get up and prepare your speech.

265
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,430
So, you're watching the past
Huazhi Award ceremonies?

266
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,510
Who's watching it?

267
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,070
It's just a coincidence.

268
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,270
Coincidence?

269
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,000
But, someone's watching
Uncle Zhou when he's receiving his award.

270
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,390
We're in the digital era, you know?

271
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,550
They knew that I am his son,

272
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,010
that's why they recommended
the video to me.

273
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,990
In this era,

274
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,230
there's no privacy at all.

275
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,270
Don't worry,

276
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,800
Uncle will surely attend
the award ceremony.

277
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,550
Who cares?

278
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,990
It's better if he's absent.

279
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,050
I won't need to listen
to his criticisms if he's absent.

280
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,670
In my family, the only way
to maintain my relationship with him

281
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,630
is to see no evil. It's better
if I don't see him.

282
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,070
Why are you such a hypocrite?

283
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,150
I know that you're happy to see him,

284
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,750
but you're unwilling to admit it.

285
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,550
It's not that.

286
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,300
Honestly speaking, my award ceremony

287
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,350
has nothing to do with him.

288
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,110
There's no reason for him to be there.

289
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,990
Am I right?

290
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,630
You're wrong.

291
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,270
I...

292
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,750
Don't tell me your parents

293
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,230
are here again?

294
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,150
How's that possible?

295
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,910
They just left last night, you know?

296
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,680
Go and open the door.

297
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,070
It's Liang Chong Lang!

298
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,260
So adorable.

299
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,780
Mr Zhou Chuan,

300
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,230
do you need to let it take a walk outside?

301
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,630
It'll depend on its mood.

302
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,460
Is that so?

303
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,550
I brought this pack of tea leaves

304
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,630
especially for you.

305
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,830
They're premium tea leaves.

306
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,360
I told my friends to buy them
from Wuyishan...

307
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,470
I don't drink tea.

308
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,020
That's right.

309
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,100
You always stay up late in order
to finish your books.

310
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,230
I should've brought you some coffee
if you want to refresh yourself.

311
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,910
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,390
I'll bring you some coffee next time.

313
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,550
Mr Liang,

314
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,670
so, why are you here today?

315
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,870
It's like this.

316
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,270
Mr Zhou Chuan,

317
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,470
regarding The Jarred Bird Within My Dream,

318
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,470
you still haven't found a publisher
for that book, right?

319
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,910
I'm here today

320
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,830
to have a chat with you.

321
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,510
I want to listen to your opinion.

322
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,630
Just a chat?

323
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,230
You're calling it a chat
when you're here with the contract?

324
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,180
Mr Liang,

325
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,590
you don't trust me at all.

326
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,830
That isn't the case at all.

327
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,830
Mr Zhou Chuan is an established writer.

328
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,270
Of course I need to see him personally.

329
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,470
This is how we show our respect to him.

330
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,550
Alright then, I'll take a look
at the contract later.

331
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,510
You should return now.

332
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,860
Why don't you
take a look at it right away

333
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,750
since I'm already here?

334
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,630
Just take a look. I can explain it for you

335
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,550
if you have any questions.

336
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,870
You see,

337
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,630
Director Yang told me something.

338
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,270
He said that

339
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,030
I will be fully in charge of this matter.

340
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,830
I'm in charge of everything.

341
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,260
Just tell me

342
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,430
if you have any requests.

343
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,760
I can give you the
final verdict right now.

344
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,790
This doesn't concern the final verdict.

345
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,950
Our Zhou Chuan

346
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,150
has been receiving too many calls lately.

347
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,670
It's hard for him to make a decision.

348
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,660
Yeah, I need to consider my options.

349
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,790
-I know that, but Mr Zhou Chuan, I...
-Don't do this.

350
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,510
I hate it when people pester me.

351
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,170
The more you pester me,
the more I'll reject you.

352
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,330
You guys can continue.

353
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,510
But, Mr Zhou Chuan...

354
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,190
He said he needs to consider this.

355
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,390
No one will be able to change his mind.

356
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,830
Chu Li,

357
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,790
you've been staying with him
for some time.

358
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,670
I guess it's easier for you

359
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,550
to communicate with him.

360
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,069
You should speak up for me

361
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,800
since you belong to our
publishing house as well.

362
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,750
Alright.

363
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,589
No problem, Mr Liang.

364
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,630
And, you should take back

Alright. See you, Mr Liang.

368
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,349
Thank you in advance.

370
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,350
Yeah.

371
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,060
I should've

We can watch the footage
whenever we're unhappy.

I'm sure it'll lighten our mood.

At least until the Huazhi Award is over.

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,390
What if you do receive the award?

380
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,390
By then,

381
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,350
we can raise our price.

382
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,270
By the way, did you prepare
for your speech?

are you nervous?

386
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,230
Not really.

387
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,030
Just keep calm.

388
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,930
He's just pretending.

389
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,220
Continue with your act.

390
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,230
I wasn't pretending.

392
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,180
are nothing to me.

Listen,

396
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,430
you should be thankful that
I didn't participate in this award.

397
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,360
If not, you'll never get the award.

398

Can you guys

399
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,430
stop insulting each other
whenever you guys see each other?

400
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,030
Precisely.

Aren't we sitting together?

411
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,830
The seats for the nominees are in front.

412

You should go to your seat.

413

Director Gu, I'll leave her to you then.

00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,230
I think as a father,

511
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,910

517
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,950

Actually, ignoring
the childish descriptions,

522
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
your novel is actually pretty good.

523
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,030
It's really rare for him
to praise his son.

524
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,030
But when he praises him,
he praises him with utmost conviction.

525
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,870
I think he has acquired something

526
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,930
more valuable than the award itself.

talk to each other again.

in a silly corner?

534

I just feel that this award

543

doesn't belong to me alone.

544
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,150

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,110
and...

547
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,070
It's all because of my editor

548
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,950
that The Book of Luo He God

549
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,990
was able to participate
in the 30th Huazhi Award.

550
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,270
My readers

551
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,630
have always been there for me as well.

552
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,070
A lot of things have happened

553
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,900
for the past few months.

554
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,870
I even doubted myself,

555
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,130
wondering if I should continue to write.

556
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,910
But now, I think that

557
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,800
as long as people have expectations of me,

558
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,270
I will

559
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,870
never stop writing!

560
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,870
I'm lucky

561
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,870
because my works are
acknowledged by everyone.

562
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,790
I hope people will give more chances

563
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,520
to the other writers who are
relatively unknown.

564
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,020
So, today, I hereby announce that

565
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,310
I will establish a fund

566
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,980
using the royalties

567
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,830
of The Jarred Bird Within My Dream.

568
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,270
The fund will be used to

569
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,700
hold literary competitions for
children who live in poverty

570
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,510
so that people will be able to
see their works.

571
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,420
Thank you.

572
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,340
Old Mr Zhou, please hang on.

573
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,550
Please say something

574
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,470
for the sake

575
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,110
of all lovers of literature.

576
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,430
Literature creation is
a gruelling process.

577
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,910
The people here...

578
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:03,990
Congratulations.

579
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,310
Thank you.

580
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,220
Mr Zhou,

581
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,870
this is my name card.

582
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,470
I hope we can work together in the future.

583
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,550
Alright, Guang Ming Publishing House?

584
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,500
I'll take note of that.

585
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,230
Let's work together
when we have the chance.

586
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,630
See you.

587
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,350
See you.

588
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,870
You should stop.

589
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,150
I feel disgusted.

590
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,810
We're leaving.

591
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,830
Mr Zhou,

592
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,470
please visit

593
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,710
our company when you're free.

594
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,310
I'll prepare a feast for you.

595
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,030
Mr Zhou,

596
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,110
I knew you would win the award.

597
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,030
You deserved it indeed.

598
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,910
Why don't you stay here for a moment?

599
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,750
Let's have a drink later.

600
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,680
Mr Zhou, wait...

601
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,510
Have a seat.

602
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:42,910
You guys are...

603
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,470
Hello, Mr Liang?

604
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,350
Thank you, Mr Liang.

605
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,020
He's busy right now.

606
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,340
-Mr Zhou.
-Mr Zhou.

607
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,070
Yeah.

608
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,150
More and more people

609
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,680
are trying to sign a contract
for his new book.

610
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,750
I can show you the pictures
if you don't believe me.

611
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,510
I don't feel like talking about
business today.

612
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,790
Let's talk about it in the future.

613
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,190
Excuse me.

614
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,790
-Mr Zhou!
-Mr Zhou!

615
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,830
Let's go.

616
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,080
Let me hold it properly.

617
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,870
Thank you so much.

618
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,070
Come and visit us when you're free.

619
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,530
Alright, I look forward
to our cooperation.

620
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,630
See you.

621
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,670
See you.

622
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,180
I'll wait for you outside.

623
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,030
Hello, Aunty.

624
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,070
Chu Li.

625
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,670
I'll return first.

626
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,270
Have a nice chat with our son.

627
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,190
Dad.

628
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,230
Don't be arrogant

629
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,390
just because you won the Huazhi Award.

630
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,270
You still have a long way to go.

631
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,140
Why aren't you saying anything?

632
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,430
I thought you have something to tell me?

633
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,360
I think both of us should talk less.

634
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,670
Silence is gold, right?

635
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,190
My son,

636
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,100
you did great with the fund establishment.

637
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,990
It's been so many years

638
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,270
since I've heard
a word of praise from you.

639
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,670
This is really rare.

640
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,590
Don't try to joke with me.

641
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,190
It's been so many years,

642
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,990
I suppose

643
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,770
we have never had
a proper conversation before.

644
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,070
Didn't you say so yourself?

645
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,750
We still have a long way to go, right?

646
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,990
Your mother always says that

647
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,390
we're just like two stubborn mules.

648
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,390
We'll kick each other with our hoofs
whenever we see each other.

649
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,710
I think it's not entirely my fault.

650
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,790
You should try to understand

651
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,430
our feelings as parents.

652
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,500
This is my first time

653
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,870
being a son as well.

654
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,300
Zhou Chuan,

655
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,990
about the incident during high school...

656
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,940
Dad,

657
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,950
I'm 28 now.

658
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,350
I've forgotten most of

659
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,750
my high school moments.

660
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,990
Even if I do remember them,

661
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,150
they're just trivial matters.

662
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,190
How could I blame my father for them?

663
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,190
You do put it in a nice way, huh?

664
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,150
If so, why did you leave the family then?

665
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,700
You want me to stay with my parents
when I'm 25?

666
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,580
I'm not as shameless as Jiang Yu Cheng.

667
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,830
Why do you always make me angry
whenever you come home then?

668
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,630
As the saying goes,
two of a trade never agree.

669
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,620
But, I've always thought of

670
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,350
our arguments as discussions.

671
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,950
But, honestly speaking,

672
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,070
you better write a new book soon.

673
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,790
If not, I'll take over

674
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,940
your place soon.

675
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,910
You're overestimating your ability.

676
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,870
I'm a long way ahead...

677
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,710
You're a long way ahead of me, right?

678
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,030
I know that.

679
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,070
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

680
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,230
Your mother is still waiting for me.

681
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,270
Dad.

682
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,260
What?

683
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,390
Can't you finish everything in one go?

684
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,630
When I was 16,

685
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,590
I gave you the first script I've written

686
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,350
when we were in the study room.

687
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,910
Actually, I just wanted you to say that

688
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,910
I'm not doing too bad.

689
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,390
I've been waiting for that for 13 years.

690
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,740
I've finally heard it today.

691
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,070
You only know how to speak nonsense.

692
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,940
You should arrange an appointment
for us to meet with

693
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,630
Chu Li's parents when you're free.

694
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,350
We want

695
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,880
to arrange your marriage
as soon as possible.

696
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,230
Alright, understood.

697
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,590
See you, Mr Zhou.

698
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,510
See you.

699
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,310
Zhou Chuan,

700
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,630
where's the award?

701
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,940
I want to take a picture of it
for my parents.

702
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,110
It looks great.

703
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,670
Your hair is wet and your feet are bare.

704
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,670
You want to catch a cold that badly?

705
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,750
I forgot about it.

706
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,070
Zhou Chuan,

707
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,830
can I sleep with this award for one night?

708
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,030
No.

709
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,110
But why?

710
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,790
This is the first award
in my life, you know?

711
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,750
I beg you.

712
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,220
The award is mine, you know?

713
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,470
But what's yours is mine as well, right?

714
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,220
Fine, I'll sleep without it.

715
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,550
I didn't say I was rejecting you.

716
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,270
I think the award by itself isn't enough.

717
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,270
Do you want the award winner as well?

718
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,270
It's quite late now.

719
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,720
Don't tell me you're just here
to take a picture of it?

720
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,810
What else do you think?

721
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,900
♫ I want to hide like a kid
who made mistakes ♫

722
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,430
♫ My heart skipped a beat ♫

723
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,190
♫ When you look at me
everything seems so cute ♫

724
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,670
♫ I am the only one feeling strange ♫

725
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,650
♫ I have got a million whys ♫

726
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,820
♫ But I can't tell ♫

727
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,960
♫ I still have my sanity ♫

728
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,010
♫ I fled for a week ♫

729
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,410
♫ You don't seem to be surprised ♫

730
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,100
♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

731
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,780
♫ I have told you a thousand times ♫

732
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,120
♫ The world is on the verge of elimination ♫

733
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,440
♫ Only you are still favoured by me ♫

734
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,590
♫ Because when you hold me in your arms ♫

735
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,580
♫ I have never felt so right ♫

736
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,640
♫ If this is not love ♫

737
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,110
You're going to tear the doll apart!

738
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,870
♫ What can I tell myself? ♫

739
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,020
That's great! You're full of energy.

740
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,390
I suppose the meat I've cooked for you
isn't wasted.

741
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,870
Er Gou, come to me.

742
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,550
Er Gou is going crazy!

743
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,310
My goodness!

744
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,270
♫ As if enemies, yet full of chemistry ♫

745
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,800
♫ We could've become sworn brothers ♫

746
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,710
You're awake? The congee is on the table.

747
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,950
Finish it while it's hot.

748
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,620
♫ If it weren't for the moonlight ♫

749
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,110
♫ I realized that I was going astray ♫

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,590
Er Gou, over there!

♫ I have got a million whys ♫

752
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,190
Er Gou, come!

753
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,470
Come to me!

754
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,910
I thought you were doing great just now?

755
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,080
♫ From a genius to a fool ♫

756
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:36,780
♫ I still have my talents ♫

757

Hello?

759
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,710
Will you be able to

760
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,810
♫ You don't seem to be surprised ♫

761
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,070
understand the happiness I'm feeling

762
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,550
when I wake up with a bowl
of hot congee on the table?

763
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,490
♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

764
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,590
You're crazy.

765
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,670
♫ I have told you a thousand times ♫

766
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,230
Jiang Yu Cheng.

767
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,510
♫ If this is not love ♫

768
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,710
I feel like getting married now.

769
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,970
♫ What can I tell myself? ♫

770
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,510
I feel like getting married as well.

771
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,900
Those are the two conditions
you want, right?

772
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,070
Later, I'll need to engage
Liang Chong Lang in a battle.

773
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,830
Both of them are a must.

774
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,510
No problem.

775
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,150
Okay.

776
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,310
Will this really work?

777
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,470
Of course.

778
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,780
It's time for us to retrieve the net.

779
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,750
Liang Chong Lang.

780
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,180
Chu Li.

781
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,380
Thank you, Mr Liang.

782
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,070
You're still eating when
you're fatter than an elephant?

783
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,390
Go to your desk.

784
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,270
Chu Li, I'm sure
you haven't had breakfast yet.

785
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,620
Here.

786
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,630
Why did Mr Zhou Chuan

787
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,710
publish the first two chapters
on his Weibo?

788
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,110
He even said that he's looking for
a publisher.

789
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,950
Didn't you close the deal with him?

790
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,550
What? That can't be!

791
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,350
I'll hold them for you.

792
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,150
I did my best

793
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,150
in persuading Mr Zhou Chuan.

794
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,710
But, the minimum number
of printed copies he requested for

795
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,030
was too high for us.

796
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,890
He requested for 500,000 copies.

797
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,190
That's a huge sum, you know?
I had to ask my superiors about it.

798
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,750
I didn't expect him to post that on Weibo

799
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,110
just after I left the house.

800
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,270
500,000 copies?

801
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,750
Are you sure Mr Zhou Chuan
requested for that himself?

802
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,340
Judging from this situation,

803
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,190
I think we're the first company

804
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,910
that knows about his asking price.

805
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,510
I wonder if we can close the deal?

806
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,270
Fine.

807
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,430
500,000 copies then.

808
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,150
It's a deal.

809
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,620
Don't I need to ask for
Director Yang's opinion?

810
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,870
Why do you need to ask for his opinion
when I can make the call here?

811
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,530
Call Zhou Chuan immediately.

812
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,230
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan?

813
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,470
Mr Liang has agreed to your condition.

814
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,830
What? Alright.

815
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,350
I'll tell him immediately.

816
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,070
Mr Liang,

817
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:54,870
Mr Zhou Chuan said
he has one more condition.

818
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,230
He has one more condition?

819
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,140
What is it?

820
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,430
He said he has lost trust in
Yuan Yue Publishing House

821
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,390
due to the incident with
Yi Shui Han last year.

822
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,910
So, in the future, he wants us
to ask for his permission

823
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,070
before we announce anything

824
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,700
about his books.

825
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,270
He wants us to include it
in the contract as well.

826
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,630
He's still on the line.

827
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,960
Mr Zhou Chuan is
listening to us right now.

828
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,510
Are you okay with that?

829
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,790
Sure, of course.

830
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,230
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan? Did you hear that?

831
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,310
Mr Liang

832
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,550
said sure.

833
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,140
Alright.

834
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,550
Thank you, Mr Liang.

835
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,030
You're welcome.

836
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,190
Why are you here?
