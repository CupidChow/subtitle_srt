00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,070
Hi.

190
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,880
Do you have Natsume Soseki?

191
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,160
You have to look for it.

192
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,430
Such a casual bookstore.

193
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,120
Natsume Soseki.

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
I found it.

195
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,400
Watch out.

196
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,910
Are you all right?

197
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,640
I am fine.

198
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,880
Why don't you come down first?

199
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,600
I'll go up.

200
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,560
Thanks.

201
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,200
Hey.

202
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,200
Hey.

203
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,760
I can carry this book myself.

204
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,030
You don't have to do this.

205
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,800
Here you go.

206
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,280
All right.

207
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,320
Put it on my account will do.

208
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,960
Thanks.

209
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,320
Didn't you take this book for me?

210
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,710
First come, first served.

211
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,570
This is the rule of the bookstore.

212
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,560
How can he change his mood
faster than turning a page?

213
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,840
My boss often says that too.

214
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,040

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,870
[Where are you, Stinky Monkey?]

216
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,280
[You went for an interview
or were you kidnapped?]

217
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,710
[That's not right.]

218
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,000
[You are a fool,
you won't fetch a good price.]

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,440
[Kidnapped but not sold.]

220
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,600
[What a pity.]

221
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,040
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

222
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,520
[I failed the interview.]

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,200
[I am on my way home.]

225
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,560

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,640

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,360
[What a coincidence.]

230
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,560
[I found one from my friend.]

231
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,090
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

232
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
[People nowadays]

233
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
[look cute on the outside.]

234
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160

Hello.

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,160
Yes, I will be right there.

244
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,080
Hi, new girl.

245
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,930
Chief Editor Yu, you want me to...

246
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,920
I want to return this.

247
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,840
Hold this.

248
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,480
Have you read it?

249
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,610
Thanks for giving me the opportunity.

250
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,080
Open the folder.

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,340
Read it before we talk.

252
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,410
Where's the future of publishing industry?

253
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,440
The end of print media

254
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,240
and the fall of nobles in
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
There are about 200 similar articles

256
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,840
in the folder.

257
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
Please let me explain.

258
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,040
I know.

259
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,960
There is also a letter from your mother,

260
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,490
persuading you to
get back on the right track.

261
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,890
I am sorry.

262
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,020
I shouldn't keep your personal items.

263
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,440
Pack up and go home.

264
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,370
Miao.

265
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,600
Has Mr Kou Wei arrived?

266
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
I am coming right now.

267
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,960
Hi.

268
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
Gu Bai Zhi.

269
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,130
Why are you here?

270
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,400
Long time no see.

271
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,640
I'm back in Shanghai.

272
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,530
We'll see each other often.

273
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,930
Mr Kou won't be coming.

274
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,040
I represent him.

275
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Xin Dun Books will handle his book.

276
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,820
He sends his termination letter.

277
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,320
Don't worry.

278
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,850
Xin Dun Books will pay the penalty.

279
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,520
The five-year contract

280
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,200
for his masterpiece is expiring soon.

281
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,960
Please stop printing it.

282
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,240
No.

283
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,440
It's impossible.

284
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't get upset.

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,880
I will call Mr Kou Wei immediately.

286
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,520
No need.

287
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,760
Mr Kou said

288
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,960
he'll ask you out for sports.

289
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,920
But as his editor,

290
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,050
you have never read his book.

291
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Gu Bai Zhi.

292
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,760
This is daylight robbery.

293
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,570
Shame on you.

294
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,120
Daylight robbery?

295
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,290
I don't think so.

296
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,290
Mr Kou chooses Xin Dun Books,

297
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,290
which is a larger company.

298
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,000
We also handle

299
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,040
copyright development.

300
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,280
We are different from Yuan Yue.

301
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,360
Instead of blaming us,
you should be thinking

302
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,240
why you can't retain him.

303
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,890
It is stated very clearly

304
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,280
in Mr Kou's contract.

305
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,000
it's valid from 2013 till 2018.

306
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,220
[Publication must be by 20 October 2013.]

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,160
It's expiring soon.

308
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,490
I'm so kind to give you
one month's notice.

309
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,300
[Party A: Kou Wei, 20 July 2013.]

310
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,680
Excuse me.

311
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,290
Chief Editor Yu.

312
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,970
I remember Kou Wei's novel

313
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,050
was launched in the autumn

314
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,560
of 2014.

315
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,880
I was in high school.

316
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,080
My mum almost beat me up

317
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
because I wanted to buy the novel.

318
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,290
Is there a problem regarding

319
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,930
the copyright expiry date?

320
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,470
[Manuscript by 20 July 2013.]

321
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,080
Yes.

322
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,160
She...

323
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,120
She is right.

324
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,210
I remember.

325
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,640
Mr Kou Wei delayed for a year

326
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,960
before he sent

327
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,280
his manuscript to us.

328
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,130
Which means

329
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,040
the publication date

330
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,720
should be postponed for a year.

331
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
She is right.

332
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,000
Therefore, the five years stated in the contract,

333
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,840
starts from the publication date.

334
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,570
If so,

335
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,280
Yuan Yue Books owns the copyright

336
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,920
for another year.

337
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,000
Gu Bai Zhi.

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,640
Come again after one year.

339
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,570
It's only one book.

340
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,950
Mr Kou's future lies in Xin Dun Books.

341
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,160
What's your name?

342
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,600
She is Chu Li.

343
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,720
She's our staff.

344
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,930
What a pity.

345
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,640
If Yuan Yue Publishing House
can't keep you,

346
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,250
come find me in Xin Dun Books.

347
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,330
[Gu Bai Zhi]

348
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,490
Gu Bai Zhi.

349
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,210
I only want to join Yuan Yue.

350
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,170
Report to the editorial
department next week.

351
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,280
Really?

352
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,250
Two months probation period.

353
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,890
You'll be paid 3,500 yuan.

354
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,730
Full attendance 100 yuan.

355
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,930
Meal subsidy 10 yuan.

356
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,960
Any questions?

357
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,960
I am good.

358
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,090
I am excited.

359
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,570
I have a question.

360
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,480
You see,

361
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,770
we have an intern

362
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,290
Du Niao Niao.

363
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,880
An extra headcount is too many.

364
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,940
Didn't you hear what I told Gu Bai Zhi?

365
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,480
We never hire non-performing staff.

366
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,170
Two interns,

367
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,650
only one gets to stay.

368
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,730
Yes, I can do it.

369
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,170
[I got the job.]

370
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,400
[I am so good.]

371
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,960
[They want me.]

372
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,450
You got the job?

373
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,050
You are a finance graduate,

374
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,120
[why must you work
in the publishing industry?]

375
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,880
[You got the job.]

376
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960

He goes straight to the subject,

562
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,210
throw in the suspense.

563
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,430
You are comparing Zhou Chuan
and Jiang Yu Cheng?

564
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,540
That's right.

565
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,860
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng is more experienced than

566
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,370
Mr Zhou Chuan.

567
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,740
He has won more awards.

568
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,770
It's not fair

569
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,090
to compare them.

570
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,900
Rest assured.

571
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,140
The Oriental Beauty

572
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,780
is Mr Zhou Chuan's first book.

573
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,420
There is room for improvement.

574
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,050
And

575
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,210
he hasn't encountered
a writer's block yet.

576
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,940
A writer's block is
nothing to be proud of.

577
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,900
I...

578
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,860
Zhou Chuan wouldn't want it.

579
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,250
Did you read his book?

580
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,820
Yes.

581
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,410
I read his book.

582
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,580
I get it.

583
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,050
Are you a fan of Jiang Yu Cheng?

584
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,250
What are you doing

585
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,890
at Zhou Chuan's book club?

586
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,140
Stop shouting.

587
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,460
What if someone hears you?

588
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,020
I am here to see someone.

589
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,300
Too bad he isn't here.

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,150
and carries a backpack?

593
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,780
How do you know?

594
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,250
She said she has been
my fan for seven years.

595
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,540
When I saw her,

596
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,270
she's putting my books
in the middle of the shelf.

597
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,530
Are you arranging my bookshelf?

598
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,050
I am sorry.

599
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,490
I...

600
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,420
Little girl.

601
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,330
An author who's no longer popular

602
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,500
will not regain his fame

603
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,420
just because

604
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,280
you arranged his books together.

605
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,660
Wait.

606
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,810
Have you read this book?

607
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,300
The Disappearing Zoo

608
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,380
is a classic.

609
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,780
It's worth a place

610
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,380
on the most noticeable spot.

611
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,740
But the truth is,

612
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,620
nobody buys

00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,420
Are you the owner of this bookstore?

615
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,020
The author of this book,
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng,

616
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,940
likes your bookstore very much.

617
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,060
Could you please

618
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,180
stop saying

619
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,420
he's an author past his prime?

620
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,780
He will feel sad if he hears you.

621
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,500
He came this morning.

622
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,750
How did you know?

623
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,420
He posted a photo.

624
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,780

The daisy in the vase

627
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,500
looks exactly like the one

628
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,860
at your entrance.

629
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,700

on the vase

631
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,140
is the same as the window in your store.

632
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,500
You are his...

633
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,940
I've liked him for seven years.

But did you know?

638
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,820
His books in the past two years

639
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,900
recorded the lowest in sales.

640
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,340
These books

641
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
are becoming antiques.

642
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,860
Yes.

643
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,700
Some of his books are not doing well.

644
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,260
But who doesn't go through ups and downs?

645
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,970
Who says no one buys his books?

646
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,980
I'll buy, I'll buy all of them.

It's not my book's issue.

She is the one having an issue.

652
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,490
That's true.

653
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,900
She didn't even like you.

654
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,330

I have told you many times, Ah Xiang.

662

You can't draw according
to your own ideas.

It's not a comic book.

664
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,940
You must satisfy the author.

I am drawing according
to his requirements.

our guest authors.

752
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,220
Can you handle the job?

753
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,300
Yes, I can.

754
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,470
Right.

755
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,710
Come with me, Xiao Niao.

756
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,420
Okay.

757
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,780
Please put these on my desk.

758
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,630
Thanks.

759
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:15,980
Chief Editor.

760
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,010
Deputy Editor.

761
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,940
Who will come

762
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,460
to the open day?

763
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,780
You don't need to worry about

764
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,980
the open day.

765
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,949
Those who can really write

766
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,949
will submit their writings online.

767
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,030
It's hard to say who will come today.

768
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,739
Hi.

769
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm the intern editor of Yuan Yue.

770
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,580
I'm Chu Li.

771
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,630
Are you here to submit your writing?

772
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,980
Let me tell you.

773
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,940
This novel

774
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,310
will win at least three major awards
for Yuan Yue Publishing House.

775
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,260
Besides the Nobel Prize in Literature,

776
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,980
Nobel Prize in Chemistry,

777
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,469
Noble Prize in Physics

778
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,179
will make an exception for it.

779
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,139
Little boy.

780
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,660
There's a typo error

781
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,860
in this sentence.

782
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,030
Grandma.

783
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,230
This is a book on Huangmei opera.

784
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,460
Perhaps you want to try
the opera publishing house?

785
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,420
The intern in the opera publishing house

786
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,150
asked me to come here.

787
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,910
Perhaps

788
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,030
I can sing for you?

789
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,750
Later,

790
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,990
I'll take you to meet

791
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,020
some authors who often work with us.

792
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,150
That will be useful.

793
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,910
No wonder my uncle says

794
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,770
you are the kindest chief editor.

795
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,040
Deputy editor.

796
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,950
Mr He Ma is one of the most

797
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,980
promising authors

798
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,780
contesting in the Huazhi Award.

799
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,950
However,

800
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,270
about the copyright

801
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,940
for his new books,

802
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,620
could you please talk to him?

803
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,580
Of course.

804
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,550
You can rest assured.

805
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,550
My uncle said

806
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,900
as long as you're in Yuan Yue,

807
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,150
you will be the editor of his books.

808
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,620
I can promise him

809
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,300
as long as you are with Yuan Yue,

810
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,700
I'll make sure you are

811
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,350
happy and comfortable.

812
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,870
Thank you.

813
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,020
You are welcome.

814
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,380
Who are these people?

815
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:18,400
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

816
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,220
[First day at work and]

817
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,350
[I have seen the
bottomless Mariana Trench]

818
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,590
[between reality and dreams.]

819
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,020
[Undercurrent running
below a calm surface.]

820
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,220
Grandpa.

821
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,660
It's working hours.

822
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,920
You can do the cleaning in the afternoon.

823
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,940
Do I look like a cleaner?

824
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,430
Aren't you here to mop the floor?

825
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,510
Unless you are here for a Quidditch match?

826
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,950
Yes.

827
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,180
I am cleaning.

828
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,940
I am old.

829
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,060
I'll clean anything

830
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,470
that looks dirty.

831
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,260
Thank you.

832
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,830
It's not dirty.

833
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,860
It isn't very dirty.

834
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,980
Just like Mum.

835
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,500
They have sharp eyes.

836
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,820
Are you a staff here?

837
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,420
I have never seen you before.

838
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,030
I am the new intern editor.

839
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,540
I am Chu Li.

840
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,070
Nice to meet you.

841
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,390
Are you a fan of Moonlight Magazine?

842
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,630
That's on the first page
of the inaugural issue.

843
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,490
My grandfather gave me that name.

844
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,110
Mr Xia.

845
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,350
You are back early.

846
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,190
Mr Xia?

847
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,870
You are the editor-in-chief.

848
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,980
Miao.

849
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,040
I heard you have contacted Zhou Chuan?

850
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,950
It's like this, Mr Xia.

851
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,190
Zhou Chuan has published only one book,

852
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,030
Oriental Beauty.

853
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,870
Compared to Kou Wei

854
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,700
there's a huge gap.

855
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,990
I've read Zhou Chuan's novel.

856
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,390
I think he's good.

857
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,630
Apart from him,

858
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,030
are there any other candidates?

859
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,260
I want to recommend

860
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,220
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng.

861
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,750
Who?

862
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,910
Jiang Yu Cheng.

863
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,180
Chu Li.

864
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,260
I remember you have a degree in finance.

865
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,790
Jiang Yu Cheng

866
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,190
is showing an obvious downward trend.

867
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,830
Does he have potential?

868
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,470
How did you get your degree in finance?

869
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,670
That's true.

870
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,310
Since he and Gu Bai Zhi

871
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,900
stopped working together,

872
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,030
he failed twice consecutively.

873
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,870
Failing twice is not a major issue.

874
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,310
Failing twice isn't a major issue?

875
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,790
This will affect

876
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,470
our jobs

877
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,310
in the editorial department.

878
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,470
Do you think it's a game?

879
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,110
That you have a few chances?

880
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,150
Do you think you can wake up

881
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:46,020
the sleeping Jiang Yu Cheng?

882
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,780
Are you better than Gu Bai Zhi?

883
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,030
Yuan Yue Publishing House

884
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,590
made Jiang Yu Cheng famous.

885
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,580
Anyone can let him go.

886
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,710
But I think

887
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,150
Yuan Yue should give him another chance.

888
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,910
Xiao Niao.

889
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,270
Chu Li.

890
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,150
Come over.

891
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,150
You heard

892
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,310
what Mr Xia said.

893
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,100
Whoever signs him first

894
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,740
and gets a good result

895
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,800
will be hired permanently.

896
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,750
I am willing to represent Yuan Yue

897
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,630
and talk to Mr Jiang.

898
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,190
I am his fan for many years.

899
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,390
My success rate may be higher.

900
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,030
I'll follow your order.

with Jiang Yu Cheng.]

Welcome.

Looking for a book?

905
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,550
Yes, I'm looking for Oriental Beauty.

It's here.

Let me pack up.

911
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,230

It's her.

913
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,210
She returns to the right path?

914
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,430
Hold it.

915
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,110
I thought you said it's
good for nothing two days ago.

916
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,070
How come you want to buy it today?

917
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,710
I didn't say it's not good.

918
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,510
I'm not going to take the blame.

919

Check your eyes if you have bad eyesight.

That's a personal attack.

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,910
Did I offend you?

927
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,070
Do I know you?

00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,790
Am I close to you?

Why did you put them far apart?

938
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,910
It's only right to put

939
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,310
their books side by side.

00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,430
Look at your shop.

942
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,390
Anybody can come in.

943
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,150
I agree.

944
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,150
Anybody can come in.

945
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,430
It's quite a good book.

946
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,600
Do you need a bag?

947
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,270
No, thanks.

948
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,110
Hurry up.

949
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,870
Hurry up.

950
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,590
Let's go.

951
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,370
What are you doing?

952
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,190
Childish.

953
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,270
2070.

954
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,790
2080.

955
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,550
2070 is here.

956
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,190
It's huge.

957
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,390
How long do I need to work

958
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,110
to afford such a big house?

959
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,750
I can hear dog barks.

960
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,150
Er Gou.

961
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,750
Great.

962
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,190
Mr Zhou Chuan isn't in today?

963
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,790
Mr Zhou Chuan.

964
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,630
Who are you?

965
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,600
[Are you]

966
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,000
[Mr Zhou Chuan?]

967
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,830
[I'm Chu Li, an editor from
Yuan Yue Publishing House.]

968
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,710
[It's like this.]

969
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,350
[I sent you a message yesterday.]

970
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,870
[But you didn't reply.]

971
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,240
[That's why I am here
without an appointment.]

972
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,040
[How come it's her?]
