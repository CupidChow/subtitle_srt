[Episode 9]

4
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,630
Shut the gate if the pipe broke.

5
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,030
Why are you covering it with hands?

6
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,630
What if the metal pipe broke?

7
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,060
You would've broken your hands.

8
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,590
Mr Zhou Chuan?

9
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,470
Put the clothes on first.

10
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,280
What's the matter with you?

11
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,310
Why did you return all of a sudden?

12
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,670
This is my house.

13
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,180
Can't I come back?

14
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,870
I haven't asked you.

15
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,509
What did you do to my pipe?

16
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,710
Perhaps it's broken due to

17
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,900
your sudden return.

18
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,630
Really?

19
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,710
And maybe it's because

20
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,390
I patted it lightly.

21
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,710
Patted it lightly?

22
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,310
Which rainforest

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,460
are you from, King Kong?

24
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,990
Pretending to be a monkey
and destroy my house.

25
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,670
Didn't you say

26
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,030
you'll be back in several days?

27
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,870
Is this the reason

28
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,430
you ran around with your pyjamas

29
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,890
and turned my bathroom into
Waterfall Cave?

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,790
You... You saw it?

31
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,150
I'm not blind.

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,310
Stop covering!

33
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,950
You'll smother yourself!

34
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,100
Where's your manners?

35
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,630
Look people in the eye
when they're talking to you.

36
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,510
I've seen it all anyway.

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,880
Just smother yourself.

38
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,950
Why are you being reasonable

39
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,310
now that you've seen it?

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,370
Why can't I look
if you dare to wear it?

41
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,350
I'm going back to the room and sleep.

42
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,310
Just say I'm not around

43
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,110
if someone looks for me.

44
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,190
Tell them you don't know where I went.

45
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,470
Especially if it's my father
and Jiang Yu Cheng.

46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,430
Hold on!

47
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,430
You haven't told me

48
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,910
why you came back all of a sudden.

49
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,110
Is it because you had a fight
with your family

50
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,750
or with Mr Jiang?

51
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,790
The 30th rule of the tenancy rules.

52
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,030
All right, I'll stop asking.

53
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,670
From my experience,

54
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,990
your father must be in a bad mood.

55
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,070
Hello.

56
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,910
Hello, Mr Jiang.

57
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,730
Why do you call me at this hour?

58
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,550
Mr Jiang, I'd like to ask you.

59
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,900
What happened to Mr Zhou Chuan?

60
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,350
He looked upset

61
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,110
when he came back just now.

62
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,750
[He seemed to have quarrelled with
his family this afternoon.]

63
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,190
We planned to have dinner tonight

64
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,450
but he didn't come too.

65
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,910
As I expected.

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,550
But how did you know he went back?

67
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,230
Isn't there a location feature
in the chat software?

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,230
[Perhaps when we were having
conversation just now,]

69
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,270
the distance between us

70
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,270
was shortened by dozen kilometres.

71
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,060
Is there such a function?

72
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,630
Yes.

73
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,230
It's getting late.

74
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,990
Get some rest.

75
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,460
I'll stop bothering you.

76
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,310
Goodbye.

77
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,430
[Breakfast is on the table.]

78
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,540
[Microwave it for
two minutes before eating.]

[Chu Li]

80
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,350
Chu Li!

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,630
Big trouble!

82
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,620
Cocoon urges the entire illustrator world

83
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,190
to boycott Yuan Yue Publishing House.

84
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,550
Saying that our editors
are hard to communicate

85
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,870
and always rush her
to submit the drafts.

86
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,540
She said we even find fault with
her drafts after handing them in

87
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,140
and threaten the illustrator
with rejection.

88
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,350
Come in.

89
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,790
Mr Liang,

90
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,790
there's something I need your help.

91
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,750
You

92
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,270
can mess things up even by just

93
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,270
making appointment with an illustrator.

94
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,950
Ask Yu Yao

95
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,270
to clean this mess up for you.

96
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,670
I can't help you.

97
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,510
Mr Liang.

[Book of Luo He God]

99
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,540
Look at this calligraphy.

[Book of Luo He God]

101
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,950
Doesn't it have an overbearing impact

102
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,550
in comparison to those books
in the same genre?

103
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,210
[Book of Luo He God]

104
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,830
An overbearing impact.

105
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,990
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,230
It's hard for me to admire

107
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,070
your poor aesthete's taste.

108
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,630
Just explain it to me.

109
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,909
We can follow the trend.

110
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,790
This is a type of mindset.

111
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,500
Everyone is wondering

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,790
if Yuan Yue Publishing House
could create something unique.

113
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,909
No one has ever

114
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,030
used this traditional ink and
calligraphy as the cover.

115
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,150
It's outdated.

116
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,230
That's why no one use it.

117
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,550
It's not outdated. Why is it outdated?

118
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,870
If we only use it

119
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,230
as couplets on the cover,

120
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,870
that will be boring

121
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,390
and outdated for sure.

122
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,710
But if we use a kind of

123
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,350
special display technique,

124
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,680
then this calligraphy
can be cool as well.

125
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,670
Then have you thought about

126
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,130
the reason why you want to
use illustrations as the book cover?

127
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,270
I've thought about it.

128
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,390
It's because many readers think

129
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,940
that would fulfil their fantasy

130
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,820
if their imaginary characters

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,460
appear vividly on the illustrations.

132
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,510
Right.

133
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,030
Then why do you want to
break their illusion?

134
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,560
Don't you think it's cruel?

135
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,940
I'm not trying to break their illusion.

136
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,630
I just want to try
a different display technique.

137
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,020
For example, we can

138
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,780
use this calligraphy on the cover

139
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,110
and use hollow technique

140
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,750
to vaguely reveal the illustration inside.

141
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,590
It will be more
attractive with this way.

142
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,190
And it can fulfil
the readers' fantasy as well.

143
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,470
Are you here to apologise?

144
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,670
But it's too late.

145
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,670
I just went to the legal department.

146
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,390
This is the termination agreement
they drafted.

147
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,460
If you're furious with
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

148
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,630
we'll agree to terminate the agreement.

149
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,910
But we will not return the drafts

150
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,150
and we own the use-right.

151
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,280
You still have to pay us twice the fine.

152
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,590
You guys were the one to spite me

153
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,780
and you still have
the audacity to fine me?

154
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,630
Who's the one that
refused to communicate

155
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,070
and violated the contract?

156
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,670
You knew it well.

157
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,270
Do you want me to

158
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,270
remind you with the chat histories?

159
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,030
I didn't hold you to account

160
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,710
because Yuan Yue Publishing House
is a big company.

161
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,990
We don't want to waste time

162
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,110
to deal with an ordinary illustrator

163
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,660
because of some trivial matters.

164
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,630
That will dishonour

165
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,090
Yuan Yue Publishing House
and Mr Zhou Chuan.

166
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,150
Who are you scolding?

167
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,950
But it's different now.

168
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,510
You're complaining around.

169
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,310
You assaulted me

170
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,790
in every illustrator group
with your illustration.

171
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,710
Have you forgotten
the privacy terms in the contract?

172
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,950
For this reason alone,

173
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,480
I can legitimately terminate
the agreement.

174
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,750
If you did that,

175
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,750
no illustrator will be willing
to cooperate with you.

176
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,180
You don't have to care about that.

177
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,990
Mr Xia

178
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,470
has invited a famous calligrapher

179
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,000
to write an epigraph for
Mr Zhou Chuan's book.

180
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,910
I can't believe you'll use

181
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,370
calligraphy as the cover.

182
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,630
This is our official account.

183
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,870
It has been forwarded over

184
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,800
ten thousand times in a short time.

185
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,430
The readers are cheering
in the comments.

186
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,190
They said the cooperation between
Zhou Chuan and Yuan Yue Publishing House

187
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,310
is a transboundary between
emerging art and traditional art.

188
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,780
Terminating the agreement

189
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,870
won't affect us in such situation.

190
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,950
But it's different for you.

191
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,350
Soon, everyone will say that

192
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,070
we terminate your agreement

193
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,460
is due to your terrible work.

194
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,100
Tell me.

195
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,030
What do you want?

196
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,790
The second plan is

197
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,470
your drafts won't be rejected.

198
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,190
Let bygones be bygones

199
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,540
but you have to sign
a complementary agreement

200
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,750
to agree that your illustrations

201
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,280
can only be used
in the poster or inside cover.

202
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,630
Only inside cover?

203
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,510
Think about it.

204
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,220
I'll leave first as I'm busy.

205
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,590
There's a truth that
I always wanted to tell you.

206
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,900
Your ability is outstanding.

207
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,750
But I was young and ignorant

208
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,030
to like you.

209
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,630
Director Gu, it's me.

210
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,230
Director Gu,

211
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,470
what should I do?
You have to help me.

212
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,270
This is quite a major controversy.

213
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,230
Director Gu, I

214
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,830
didn't meet the deadline

215
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,790
because of you.

216
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,790
I just asked you for
the cover of Yun Fei.

217
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,780
You can't complete the job you took

218
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,510
and now you're blaming it on me.

219
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,370
It won't do me any good
if you screw up.

220
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,310
I have ways to give us an out.

221
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,290
I'll do anything you want.

222
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,910
Chu Li,

223
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,510
look, Cocoon just issued a statement.

224
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,780
She said people got the wrong idea.

225
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,910
"It has nothing to do with
the editor of Yuan Yue Publishing House."

226
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,870
"I worked well with
Yuan Yue Publishing House."

227
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,430
"We even had coffee
together this afternoon

228
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,780
and discuss about
Mr Zhou Chuan's new book."

229
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,190
She even posted the photo of the cafe.

230
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,270
It's really hard for her.

231
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,710
I guess her heart was bleeding

232
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,670
when she wrote these words.

233
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,670
[Sorry,]

234
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,070
[the user you're calling is unavailable.]

235
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,550
[Mr Zhou Chuan,]

236
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,990
[I've taken care of
the matter of the cover.]

237
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,350
[You'll be satisfied.]

238
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,110
[Chu Li]

239
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,270
Chu Li.

240
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,190
Mr Xia.

241
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,830
This cover

242
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,100
is interesting. Look.

243
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,120
Monochrome calligraphy
is eye-catching

244
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,550
[Book of Luo He God, Zhou Chuan]

245
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,630
and Cocoon's colourful drawing

246
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,510
can be seen vaguely.

247
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,590
It's the combination
of modern and traditional.

248
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,950
I'm very satisfied.

249
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,910
This is my idea

250
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,270
but it's designed by Ah Xiang.

251
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,510
You've done a great job
in such a short time.

252
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,510
Ah Xiang,

253
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,310
I think

254
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,710
you're as good as Cocoon.

255
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,310
Youngster like you
should express yourself more.

256
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,310
Don't always hide in the back.

257
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,350
Okay, the design of this cover

258
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,230
will be settled once it's completed.

259
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,950
The next step is to collaborate with

260
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,230
the circulation department
in publicizing it.

261
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,550
Right, Chu Li.

262
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,070
I heard that you assured Miao and Liang

263
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,270
that you can reach the sales volume
of 350,000 for the book?

264
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,470
All right.

265
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,430
That's brave.

266
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,550
But you have to walk the talk.

267
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,710
I'll try my best, Mr Xia.

268
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,390
Oh my god!

269
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,140
Is Mr Zhou Chuan
experiencing depression?

270
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,830
Brother, are you still alive?

271
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,620
Mr Zhou?

272
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,900
Mr Zhou, what do you want
to have for dinner?

273
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,270
I don't want to eat.

274
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,540
Dinner is on the dining table.

275
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
Remember to eat it when you come out.

276
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,190
Mr Zhou, I've taken care
of Cocoon's cover.

277
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,750
You don't have to worry.

278
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,230
[Do not disturb]

279
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,460
This can't go on.

280
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,990
What are you doing?

281
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,430
What are you doing?

282
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,630
Open your door.

283
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,690
I can't hear you with the door closed.

284
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,950
I said what...

285
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,870
Why don't you get up?

286
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,830
It's improper for man and
woman to be too intimate.

287
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,350
What does that mean?

288
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,390
Where is the last pretty boy

289
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,070
in 21st century like we said?

290
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,870
What's going on

291
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,330
as you look like a caveman?

292
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,510
Get out.

293
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,150
Mr Zhou,

294
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,390
how long do you plan
to lock yourself?

295
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,150
You don't even update
your article on the internet.

296
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,230
The readers thought you went missing.

297
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,670
Do you know that cause for concern?

298
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,310
What's going on?

299
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,310
Why do you take it on all by yourself?

300
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,900
Why is your face

301
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,870
so big?

302
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,870
Right, right.

303
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,870
I know I'm a freeloader.

304
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,870
And I bother you
with the matter of publication.

305
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,200
It's true that I am bold.

306
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,180
But we live under the same roof after all.

307
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,390
We are not friends

308
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,790
but we are more than
just a nodding acquaintance.

309
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,869
I'll ask you even if you think

310
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,829
that I'm nosy.

311
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,990
What happened when you were
in your hometown?

312
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,790
What's with all those emotions?

313
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,940
I just asked you

314
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,349
why your face is this big.

315
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,589
I mean your facial shape

316
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,390
is big.

317
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,390
Then,

318
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,589
how about this?

319
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,710
Why are you playing dumb?

320
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,750
Can you get out?

321
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,350
I'm fine, I just want
to rest for two days.

322
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,190
Every job provides annual leaves.

323
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,870
Is that too much for a writer

324
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,330
to rest for several weeks?

325
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,980
This is not a break.

326
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,030
You're attaining mortality.

327
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,110
As your editor,

328
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,030
I can't sit there

329
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,310
and watch you ascend.

330
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,870
I don't need an editor
to worry about me.

331
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,710
How about this?

332
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,030
Let's eat out later.

333
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,030
It's my treat.

334
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,030
I know there's a restaurant nearby

335
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,470
which sells delicious beef pot.

336
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,070
Let's go.

337
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,070
Eat out?

338
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,350
The 7th rule of the tenancy rules.

339
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,150
"No outside food as cover-up."

340
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,940
And you violated the 8th rule just now.

341
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,750
"Taking advantage of
living under the same roof

342

relationship between the landlord

343
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,670
and the tenant is forbidden..."

344
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,390
Stop!

345
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,750
The 4th rule. "Respect your landlord."

346
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,390
The 5th rule. "Respect..."

347
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,390

348
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,630

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,750
Good morning.

371
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,110
Have you finished writing the book?

372
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,110
Why do you mention book
once you see me?

373
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,780
Go back and write it
if you haven't finished.

374
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,550
I refuse to.

375
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,750
Exercising makes me
feel better when writing.

376
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,990
Then just exercise near your house.

377
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,920
Don't come here.

378
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,950
The air and view here are good.

379
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,880
That makes me more energetically.

380
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,030
Yun Fei,

381
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,310
I'm not a young lady.

382
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,670
I know what you're thinking.

383
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,390
I'll make it clear with you.

384
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,790
This won't work for us.

385
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,950
Why won't it work?

386
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,790
You are

387
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,150
a young lady to me.

388
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,510
What's wrong with me?

389
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,870
I won't date the author.

390
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,630
Do you refuse to date an author

391
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,340
or me?

392
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,270
I heard that

393
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,390
you had

394
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,120
dated Mr Jiang Yu Cheng before.

395
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,150
Right?

396
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,430
Just ask the one

397
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,430
you heard it from.

398
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,040
Then just leave this aside.

399
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,790
What if I

400
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,110
like you?

401
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,990
I want to court you,

402
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,460
and I want to date you?

403
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,910
I have a headache.

404
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,610
Did you have a fight with your family?

405
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,080
Did Jiang Yu Cheng tell you?

406
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,670
He really has a blabbermouth.

407
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,630
No, no. He didn't say anything.

408
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,990
I just guessed it.

409
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,630
You asked me

410
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,190
if I have no childhood
or I'm heartless.

411
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,190
Why I don't miss my time as a student?

412
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,730
I really don't miss it.

413
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,590
How is it possible?

414
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,790
People like you...

415
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,980
You have good looks

416
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,150
and you're talented.

417
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,620
You're great in writing

418
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,670
and you're graduated
from top university.

419
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,270
Your school days

420
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,830
should be your finest moment.

421
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,250
Let me tell you a story about a friend.

422
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,910
[Father,]

423
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,480
[have you read my manuscript?]

424
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,670
[Is it all written by you?]

425
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,280
[It should have more
than 200,000 words.]

426
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,320
[I didn't count the words.]

427
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,590
[When do you start to write it?]

428
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,870
[I think I started from senior one. ]

429
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,600
[I wrote it once I had the time.]

430
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,940
[How is it?]

431
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,870
[I finally realize]

432
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,550
[the reason why your result]

433
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,630
[didn't improve]

434
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,150
[in your senior years.]

435
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,180
[You wasted your time and energy]

436
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,310
[on writing this meaningless stuff.]

437
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,550
[This stuff?]

438
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,470
[Then what kind of
stuff did you write?]

439
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,270
[What kind of attitude is that?]

440
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,990
[A man should know his place.]

441
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,950
[You've been rejected
by several publishing houses.]

442
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,410
[It wasn't for no reason.]

443
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,830
[I can hardly read]

444
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,630
[half of your manuscripts.]

445
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,630
[I don't know what you're writing!]

446
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,350
[Tell me]

447
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,030
[what you're trying to say.]

448
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,470
[Does your novel
mention any real life?]

449
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,230
[Does it have any social sense?]

450
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,030
[Does it have your own thought?]

451
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,710
[Nothing at all!]

452
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,710
[Some of them is just self-righteous]

453
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,820
[wit and pubertal venting.]

454
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,110
[A shallow novel like this
which is only for entertainment]

455
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,510
[will never be
considered as literature.]

456
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,020
[I can teach you the correct]

457
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,430
[literary writing]

458
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,760
[after your college
entrance exam ends.]

459
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,910
[I don't want to write anymore.]

460
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,170
[What does that mean?]

461
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,160
[Does the stuff you
write have any point?]

462
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,630
[You are just imposing]

463
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,990
[your value on others.]

464
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,100
[Saying that your
writing is meaningless,]

465
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,560
[this is me being gentle.]

466
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,230
[If I were to be harsh,]

467
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,870
[I would say what you write is trash!]

468
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,470
[It's a waste of papers!]

469
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,510
[Are you satisfied?]

470
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,950
No way!

471
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,710
That was cruel!

472
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,990
How could he tear his son apart

473
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,920
after working so hard to raise him?

474
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,500
Are you talking about my father or me?

475
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,160
You guys are in the same strain.

476
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,910
So,

477
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,230
Oriental Beauty is not
your first novel.

478
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,270
It's not. My first novel

479
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,930
was called trash by my father.

480
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,390
So, now you know why I refused to

481
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,660
sign the contract with Miao.

482
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,710
Apart from being a glib,

483
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,060
he always talks about
father-son enterprise.

484
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,230
"Mr Zhou senior must
be very proud of you."

485
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,790
"Father and son make a literary family."

486
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,990
He would say the words that I

487
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,950
hate the most in my life
within ten seconds.

488
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,630
So,

489
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,660
I could only tell him to stay out.

490
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,510
Mr Zhou Chuan, I didn't expect

491
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,340
there's such bitterness

492
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,350
behind your smile.

493
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,180
I didn't expect you can still create
Oriental Beauty, such masterpiece

494
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,350
after your maiden work was torn.

495
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,990
I really admire

496
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,070
your indomitable spirit.

497
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,150
Did you learn this

498
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,990
exaggerate expression from Miao?

499
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,700
Do I look alike?

500
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,630
Your flattering gaze isn't alike.

501
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,870
But Mr Zhou Chuan, to be honest.

502
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,470
I believe that you can get back up

503
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,750
in front of your detractors

504
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,390
after Book of Luo He God is published

505
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,550
and say aloud,

506
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,470
"Look, I did it!"

507
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,670
You can invite me if you think

508
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,270
you have insufficient aura.

509
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,870
Why are you staring at me?

510
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,790
I... I'm just thinking that

511
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,070
you look cute today.

512
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,220
But your face is big.

513
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,630
Here, here!

514
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,230
Eat a sweet ice cream when you're upset.

515
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,470
I don't want to eat it.

516
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,750
Try this ice-cream.

517
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,230
It's very delicious.

518
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,230
I don't want to.

519
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,750
It's too sweet.

520
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,430
Right, it's quite sweet.

521
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,510
Let's go home early.

522
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,750
Er Gou is waiting for us to feed him.

523
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,350
I warn you.

524
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,950
Don't engage in such
boring activity anymore.

525
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,910
Okay.

526
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,430
Sister.

527
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,910
We have a special rapport.

528
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,630
Why are you here again?

529
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,830
I'm here to court you.

530
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,150
Are you free tonight?

531
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,910
I'll eat with you.

532
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,590
I'm not free. I'm going somewhere.

533
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,650
I'll come with you.

534
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,010
It's a private matter.

535
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,230
I... No.

536
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,790
I'll never disturb you.

537
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,350
I'm already here, sister.

538
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,590
Get in the car.

539
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,990
So, this dictionary is published!

540
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,150
I'm not dreaming, right?

541
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,230
You're not dreaming.

542
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,390
I thought

543
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,980
once the data dictionary has launched,

544
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,910
this thing I made

545
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,380
would be completely worthless.

546
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,070
Why would it be worthless?

547
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,670
The gold will shine one day.

548
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,030
I put seven years of my life into it!

549
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,030
It's not wasted.

550
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,830
I can

551
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,310
retire comfortably now.

552
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,750
Why didn't you take Jiang with you?

553
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,110
Has he finished writing his new book?

554
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,590
His new book is already on sale.

555
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,870
He is too busy recently.

556
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,150
I'll take him to visit you
after some time.

557
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,670
Okay, okay.

558
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,030
Time to eat.

559
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,790
Let me treat you
with a cup of juice tea.

560
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,870
Then,

561
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,470
I want to tell you a good news.

562
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,470
Thanks for your juice tea.

563
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,310
What is the good news?

564
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,470
After a few days of the publication of

565
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,910
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

566
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,830
there're many letters from the readers.

567
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,430
I think it's obvious
that Mr Jiang Yu Cheng

568
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,890
will become famous again.

569
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,420
I'll be happy as long as Mr Jiang

570
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,750
could keep writing

571
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,550
new articles.

572
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,350
Then I pray for your teacher

573
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,950
to keep on writing and succeeding.
How is it?

574
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,790
Everyone come take
two movie tickets from me.

575
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,670
Movie ticket?

576
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,500
This is the perk comes with Yuan Yue.

577
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,630
There's a replay of a movie

578
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,670
about an author and an editor this week.

579
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,460
By then, you can

580
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,190
watch it with an author
who is close with you.

581
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,150
It's a chance to build
rapport with them.

582
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,630
Okay, thank you, Chief Editor.

583
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,230
Okay.

584
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,630
Thank you, Chief Editor.

585
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,630
Chu Li.

586
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,460
The respond of
Jiang Yu Cheng's serial is good.

587
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,420
This is the publishing contract of
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

588
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,180
But

589
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,310
the minimum guaranteed print run
the Marketing Department provides

590
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,790
is the same with Book of Luo He God.

591
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,950
He said since you could score this number

592
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,480
and handled Zhou Chuan, then
you can also handle Jiang Yu Cheng.

593
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,790
But the styles of these two authors

594
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,990
are totally different.

595
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,820
I know. I know.

596
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,870
It's hard.

597
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,150
But... That's why you should find a way

598
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,750
to take Mr Jiang and make him

599
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,410
sign the agreement promptly.

600
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,550
I understand.

601
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,990
I'll try my best.

602
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,710
All right.

603
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,910
Then do you want to
watch it with Mr Zhou Chuan

604
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,510
or Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

605
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,430
Make your own decision.

606
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,630
Do you mean the movie?

607
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,870
If I invite Mr Zhou Chuan,

608
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,700
he'll tell me not to bother him

609
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,070
with such boring activity.

610
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,830
And he'll stick these two movie tickets

611
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,150
on my forehead as if they are

612
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,550
Demon Sedative Amulets.

613
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,310
Sister,

614
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,540
is Ms Liu your relative?

615
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,070
Don't ask something you shouldn't.

616
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,150
When is that dictionary

617
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,540
published?

618
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,140
Why haven't I seen it before?

619
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,940
That dictionary was planned to publish

620
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,140
but it got cancelled.

621
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,720
Ms Liu had made painstaking efforts in it.

622
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,420
She couldn't accept that

623
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,300
and had sudden cerebral haemorrhage.

624
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,110
That's why she lives here.

625
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,390
I see.

626
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,350
So, Ms Liu is your senior.

627
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,950
Then why was the publication cancelled?

628
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,910
Why do you have so many questions?

629
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,430
That's because I want to know you more.

630
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,030
Okay, I'll ask other people

631
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,160
if you don't want to tell me.

632
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,630
I was Ms Liu's apprentice.

633
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,730
As for the cancellation
of the publication,

634
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,310
who would buy

635
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,970
a paper dictionary nowadays?

636
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,260
The era has changed.

637
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,950
Mr Zhou Chuan.

638
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,390
The new books are on the shelf over there.

639
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,430
Okay, thank you.

640
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,670
Mr Zhou Chuan.

641
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,110
Chief Editor Yu.

642
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,750
What a coincidence!

643
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,790
Right, that's a coincidence!

644
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,700
I was talking to one of my authors.

645
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,990
Right, has Chu Li invited you?

646
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,950
Our company

647
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,270
has given out two movie tickets

648
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,630
to each person.

649
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,350
If Chu Li invites you,

650
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,670
please accept her.

651
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,670
This...

652
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,110
About the movie, I...

653
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,230
I don't really like to watch movie.

654
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,990
Why don't you ask her
to invite other person?

655
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,430
I think Chu Li must be really sincere

656
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,990
if she invites you.

657
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,630
Just consider it as a senior

658
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,580
taking the junior to edify sentiment.

659
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,510
And let her learn from you.

660
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,590
All right.

661
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,750
I'll reluctantly agree to it

662
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,590
if you say so.

663
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,470
Mr Zhou Chuan, you're a gentleman,

664
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,580
very generous.

665
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,420
I'm sorry, I've got a call.

666
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,190
I'll go to work first.

667
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,710
Go ahead.

668
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,910
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

669
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,030
Hello.

670
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,130
Just call that number will do.

671
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

672
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,710
are you going to
walk the red carpet?

673
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,110
The Ideal Empire?

674
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,580
The original version of
The Ideal Empire is written in Greek.

675
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,670
You're reading the
English version which is

676
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,150
translated from the Chinese version.

677
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,180
There are two languages in between.

678
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,870
It will create biases
from the original text.

679
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,470
I suggest you

680
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,070
to read the Chinese version.

681
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,510
Those translation experts

682
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,110
are professional after all.

683
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,380
I'm going to cook now.

684
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,310
Teacher, I've drafted the agreement.

685
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,270
I'll send it to you

686
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,830
if you're free tomorrow.

687
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,880
What are you doing?

688
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,870
Who are you talking with?

689
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,510
Mr Jiang, who else would it be?

690
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,790
Tomorrow is your day off.

691
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,860
Why don't you sleep in?

692
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,350
Why do you want to send agreement?

693
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,990
Just send it to him by delivery.

694
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,430
Why do I have to send delivery
while we're living in the same city?

695
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,870
Yuan Yue Publishing House
has given me two movie tickets.

696
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,230
Let's go and watch it together

697
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,270
if you're free.

698
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,070
It's about author and editor...

699
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,630
You're going to watch
the movie with Jiang Yu Cheng?

700
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,489
Are two of you close enough
to watch movie together?

701
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,030
And Yuan Yue Publishing House

702
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,230
doesn't stipulate that
Jiang Yu Cheng must watch it.

703
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,429
It gave two movie tickets

704
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,350
for you to watch it
with anyone you like.

705
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,790
Right, Yuan Yue Publishing House
didn't stipulate

706
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,989
the person I want to watch it with.

707
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:26,989
But aren't we going out

708
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,870
together tomorrow?

709
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,530
We can watch it together then.

710
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,550
Give it back to me.

711
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,420
Then

712
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,270
what movie are you planning to watch?

713
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,670
City of Words.

714
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,429
This movie is replaying recently.

715
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,429
Of course I know it.

716
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,429
You know it?

717
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,710
Why?

718
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,590
Am I not allowed to take interest in

719
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,449
theatrical and biography movie?

720
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,300
I'm planning to watch it too.

721
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,469
You're planning to watch it?

722
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,350
So,

723
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,280
don't watch it with Jiang Yu Cheng.

724
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,750
First come, first served.

725
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,310
I said I want to watch it first.

726
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,440
It's me who stand in front of you first.

727
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,270
Isn't one of these

728
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,560
two movie tickets supposed to be mine?

729
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,110
That's not reasonable.

730
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,630
Why is it not reasonable?

731
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,110
We have the same editor.

732
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,870
Am I not your author?

733
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,070
Yuan Yue Publishing House didn't mention

734
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,740
that you must give
this ticket to Jiang Yu Cheng.

735
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,200
Why can't you give it to me?

736
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,830
You make me feel dizzy.

737
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,550
[Okay, then see you tomorrow at noon.]

738
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,750
[I'll buy you lunch.]

[What do you want to eat?]

740
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,090
Let's go and watch it tonight.

741
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,510
Let's eat out and watch the movie.

742
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,350
Don't do that.

743
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,820
It's just a movie ticket.

744
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,230
It's only 38 yuan.

745
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,510
Aren't they money?

746
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,510
38 yuan is money as well.

747
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,420
How about this?

748
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,230
Both of you go and watch it.

749
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,110
I'm not going.

750
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,070
Two authors watch this kind of movie?

751
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,030
What are we going to do?

752
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,070
Complaining about

753
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,130
how unreliable the current editor is

754
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,510
or teasing each other?

755
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,790
"This drained author looks like you."

756
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,350
"The arrogant and annoying look

757
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,350
of this male lead looks familiar."

758
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,710
Okay, I surrender.

759
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,870
How about this?

760
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,350
You and Mr Jiang, each of you will get

761
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,790
one of these two free movie tickets.

762
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,990
I'll buy this movie ticket which

763
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,630
costs 38 yuan with my own money

764
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,710
and sit between you guys.

765
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,830
I won't give him a chance

766
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,950
to tease you for being arrogant.

767
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,740
And I won't give you a chance

768
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,590
to tease him for being drained.

769
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,720
That's okay, right?

770
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,070
Can you leave here

771
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,550
if there's nothing else?

772
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,590
Can you cut the potatoes

773
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,180
and beef for me

774
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,270
if you have nothing to do?

775
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,000
We're having beef
stewed with potatoes tonight.

776
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,460
I want to eat pizza

777
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,510
tomorrow at noon.

778
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,610
Ask Jiang Yu Cheng to treat us.

779
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,470
Chu Li,

780
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,750
why is he here?

781
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,670
He? He...

782
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,830
Unfortunately,

783
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,550
while you're maintaining
the relationships

784
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,140

785
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,790
so am I.

00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,510
One order of red wine
bovine tendon pizza with thin crust.

787
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,910
Extra cheese, thank you.

788
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,790
Why do you wear like this today?

789
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,670
You can only wear it out

790
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,330
if you were ten years younger.

791
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,590
I've never seen your suit too.

792
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,030
Why? Did you buy it last night

793
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,630
and ask for urgent delivery?

794
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,370
Aren't we here to watch movie?

795
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,230
Why do you wear

796
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,090
like a playboy?

797
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,910
This is to respect the lady.

798
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,590
Who would be like you?

799
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,830
As if you were going to
walk the red carpet of the Oscars.

800
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,070
I look formal with whatever I wear.

801
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,310
I can't help it too.

802
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,510
I'm frustrated too.

803
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,270
I want to eat chicken pizza.

804
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,950
I'm sorry, Chu Li.

805
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,790
It's easy to be childish

806

807
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,270

00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,460
You eat snack after having meal?

812
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,710
Is your stomach an abyss?

813
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,430
I'm full that

814
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,230
I'm almost puke as the pizza is huge.

815
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,990
That's because
you've eaten too much, okay?

816
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,550
I...

817
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,180
Here.

818
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,030
Thank you, Mr Jiang.

819
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,030
It's all sweet.

820
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,890
Are you treating her like a child?

821
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,980
Have you heard a saying?

822
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,990
Gift blind the eyes.

823
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,790
I'm helping you to
accommodate the awkwardness

824

in case your food is wasted.

825
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,310
Didn't you just have meal?

826
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,190
Why are you eating again?

827
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,030
I just ate a small piece.

828
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,910
You're heavy enough.

829
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,430
You...

830
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,670
Why do you say something this harsh?

831
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,950
I tell you what.

832
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,030
If Er Gou was a female,

833
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,630
he would have left the house.

834
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,270
Thanks for speaking up, Mr Jiang.

835
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,020
Someone is really poor

836
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,590
as he's mooching meals.

837
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,100
You even want to
treat us dinner after lunch.

838
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,630
Are you thinking that you're rich?

839
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,310
I suggest you to transfer it
to my bank card.

840
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,590

841

842
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,030
I'm just planning to

843
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,590
go to the same restaurant.

844
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,650
I didn't say I'm going to mooch meals.

845
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,150
I'm not telling you
which restaurant we booked.

846
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,610
Then I insist to follow you

847
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,830
and see which restaurant you go.

848
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,990
Why don't we go back home

849
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,230
and have our own meal?

850
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,380
I agree.

851
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,930
I have someone to prepare
three meals for me anyway.

852
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,590
You've hire a new maid?

853
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,550
And you have the audacity

854
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,830
to follow us?

855
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,230
You must be rich then.

856
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,510
I didn't hire a cooking maid.

857
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,370
She even walks the dog, writes
and watches television with me.

858

It's said that the cover illustrator of

00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,670
has a crush on you.

862
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,430

00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,110
Am I blind?

865
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,980

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,950
can we talk about
the publication contract?

880
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,630
Mr Jiang, take a look.

881
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,870
The number in the agreement

882
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,310
is the same with Zhou Chuan's
Book of Luo He God.

883
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,750
But...

884
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,550
I'm sorry, Chu Li.

885
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,670
I think you know

886
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,990
what I'm going to say.

887
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,070
I, too, know

888
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,470
what you're going to say.

889
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,710
It doesn't matter that the minimum
guaranteed print run is less.

890
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,910
What matters is Yuan Yue
Publishing House can sell it.

891
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,590
As long as the sales
of this book is high,

892
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,190
then you'll pay me a reasonable royalty,

893
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,990
right?

894
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,600
Did you convince
Zhou Chuan with the same way?

895
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,510
Seems like Mr Zhou Chuan
has complaint to you.

896
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,590
Of course,

897
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,790
there're many other reasons.

898
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,830
Zhou Chuan

899
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,030

901
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,230
Perhaps he's full of ego too.

902
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,960
He's willing to sign
Book of Luo He God over to you.

903
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,190
It's more of

904
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,510
having self-confidence

905
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,150
than having faith in you.

906
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,140
You're right.

907
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,190
I know that.

in the sales volume

For the second and third series,

913
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,270
each of them was
the famous book for everyone.

914
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,670
They were placed on
the best-seller spot in every bookstore.

915
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,630
But the fact is

916
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,830
every book I wrote has been

917
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,490
in downward trend since then.

918
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,660
Those two books that
I recently published

919
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,100
have poor sales too.

920
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,300
I can't afford to lose.

921
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,150
Mr Jiang.

922
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,030
But I've said that

923
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,990
I'll give you a chance.

924
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,990
What chance?

925
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,900
Please give me a satisfying figure
after Zhou Chuan's

926
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,630
Book of Luo He God is published.

927
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,070
Like you said before,

928
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,510
prove it to me.

929
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,670
Let me see

930
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,580
your value as an editor.

931
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,590
If you can't even handle
a famous author

932
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,860
like Zhou Chuan,

933
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,390
then don't even think about

934
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,150
helping someone like me.

935
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,630
It's embarrassing to talk about

936
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,990
the sales volume and

937
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,120
the terms of royalty

938
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,790
in front of my fan.

939
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,320
Do you feel disillusioned?

940
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,470
No, I don't feel that way.

941
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,390
I'm different from Zhou Chuan.

942
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,750
Right, you guys are quite different.

943
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,640
He only wants to write happily.

944
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,190
For me, I want more.

945
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,470
Mr Zhou Chuan publishes
his book with rage.

946
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,590
He wants to show that his father

947
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,390
was wrong with his achievement.

948
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,070
You've shifted with the market
from the beginning.

949
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,310
You're the chosen one,

950
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,640
a best-selling author.

951
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,430
Everyone gets what they need.

952
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,830
There's neither lowliness nor nobleness.

953
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,830
Being a commercial author
is nothing to be ashamed of.

954
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,420
If you have no desire

955
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,390
to write,

956
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,500
then things you write
will never be a big seller.

957
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,790
Moreover, I've seen it.

958
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,230
You are genuine when writing this book.
