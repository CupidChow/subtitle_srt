[Moonlight]

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 28]

4
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,430
My surname is Fang.

5
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,030
I'm the assistant and
translator of Mr Maurer.

6
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,789
Mr Maurer just arrived in Chinese mainland

7
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,110
and is still settling down.

8
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,110
He's having a rest.

9
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,830
He approves of the works of both of you.

10
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,900
Yet,

11
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,430
you all are aware that

12
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,229
Mr Maurer will only accept

13
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,509
one collaborator.

14
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,350
Mr Maurer will never ask about

15
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,630
your past achievements again.

16
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,230
Now, you're going to be on
the same starting line.

17
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,750
Fight for this opportunity

18
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,270
as a writer.

19
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,070
I'm taking off.

20
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,550
It turned out to be a writing test.

21
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,750
It's been a long time

22
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,350
since I wrote a composition.

23
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,390
That's Maurer's style.

24
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,550
A traditional Chinese story

25
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,470
set in a carp pond.

26
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,270
You have only one day and a night.

27
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,790
What do you plan to write about?

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,630
We're competitors after all.

29
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,390
We'll figure it out on our own.

30
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,579
Let's go.

31
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,750
Where are we going?

32
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,150
The composition title is right here.

33
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,390
I'll get you home first.

34
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,710
Your lips are all pale.

35
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,060
Have you figured out what to write about?

36
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,870
Don't worry. I've done so long ago.

37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,150
Let's go.

38
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,180
Did you place those two fishes
at my bedroom door

39
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,590
yesterday night?

40
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,830
I saw them

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,590
during my night walk.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,710
Didn't you quite like animals?

43
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,990
Don't ever do that again.

44
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,270
And never bring up the past again.

45
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,510
You don't want me to bring it up.

46
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,310
Is it because you don't want to

47
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,990
or are afraid to hear about it?

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,110
You should think about the composition.

49
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,310
Why did you get up?

50
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,830
How many times have I told you?

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,670
Put your shoes on. The floor is cold.

52
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,790
I just wanted to have some water.

53
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,070
Here, lie down first.

54
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,620
Leave your hands in there.

55
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,590
Give me a second.

56
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,070
Did you buy these for me?

57
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,310
I read online that
it makes one feel comfortable.

58
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,110
Thanks.

59
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,630
Silly girl.

60
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,340
Here, finish the brown sugar drink.

61
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,660
The manuscript is due tomorrow.

62
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,310
Have you prepared for it?

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,670
Don't worry. Who do you think I am?

64
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,750
Alright, stop talking.

65
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,870
Go to sleep early. I'll keep you company.

66
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,230
You must remember to submit
the manuscript tomorrow.

67
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,870
You'd better set an alarm earlier.

68
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,030
Wake up very early to write it.

69
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,830
Got it. Go to sleep.

70
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,390
You're so noisy.

71
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,070
And you should stop shaking your leg.

72
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,870
Are you purposely messing with me

73
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,390
because you're having writer's block?

74
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,950
I'm afraid you'd cry

75
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,950
if I hand in my exam paper too soon.

76
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,230
Stop bickering already.

77
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,990
Had you just shut your mouths,

78
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,750
you'd have done with
the introductions by now.

79
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,430
Anyway,

80
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,950
short stories with the same theme.

81
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,550
Suspense genre is more advantaged indeed.

82
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,710
It's difficult for
oriental fantasy genre to stand out

83
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,230
if you can't integrate them.

84
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,710
It seems that Jiang Yu Chen's
more likely to win.

85
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,590
Director Gu.

86
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,270
It's not over yet.

87
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,510
How do you know who will win?

88
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,430
Zhou Chuan.

89
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,950
Did you leave your soul home?

90
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:56,630
Once upon a time, there was
a quiet, peaceful little village.

91
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,980
[Are we going to lose today?]

92
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,670
Gentlemen, have you

93
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,380
finished writing your stories?

94
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,590
Could I take a look at them?

95
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,550
So that I can prepare for translation.

96
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,750
Thank you.

97
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,670
Also,

98
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,870
Mr Maurer

99
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,670
would like to invite you all for dinner.

100
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,230
Thank you.

101
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,270
See you tonight.

102
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,190
What did you write about?

103
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,310
It's a story about carp leaping over
the dragon's gate.

104
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,590
It's about a black carp

105
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,470
who attempts to leap over
the dragon's gate,

106
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,430
at the request of its partner.

107
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,390
But it never succeeds.

108
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,190
That's why it's mocked by its race.

109
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,260
Feeling ashamed,

110
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,670
it blames its failure

111
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,790
on its partner's vanity.

112
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,380
It once thought that

113
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,380
it loved a dragon,

114
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,750
not its true self.

115
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,870
So they break up.

116
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,740
The black carp

117
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,030
has been in low spirits since then.

118
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,990
But it doesn't like

119
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,670
to be a good-for-nothing.

120
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,350
Thus, it puts its all

121
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,550
into its numerous attempts of
leaping over the dragon's gate.

122
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,350
Three years.

123
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,910
Come rain or shine,

124
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,230
it never stops trying.

125
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,470
One day,

126
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,270
it finally succeeds.

127
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,220
The moment it turns into a dragon,

128
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,590
it looks back and sees
the smile of its lover.

129
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,750
That's when it realises that,

130
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,590
the happiness the smile brings it

131
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,990
is way important than
turning into a dragon.

132
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,100
We shouldn't be here,

133
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,350
should we?

134
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,750
Yeah, we should get out of here.

135
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,020
In fact, behind its countless failures,

136
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,710
its partner is always there with it.

137
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,590
It believes the black carp

138
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,230
doesn't belong to the pond

139
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,710
and will become part of
the dragon race eventually.

140
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,980
There's still some time before dinner.

141
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,710
I'll head back and get changed.

142
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,940
Don't you want to hear the ending?

143
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,310
We do.

144
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,550
What's the ending?

145
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,310
Yeah.

146
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,910
The black carp gives up on
its identity as a dragon.

147
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,830
When the dragon scales come off,

148
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,950
all its hesitations go away.

149
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,950
It transforms itself into a golden carp,

150
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,190
leaps down the dragon's gate,

151
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,900
and is back to its lover.

152
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,470
What are you waiting for? Go after her.

153
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,110
Though you and Mr Jiang are competitors,

154
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,390
I find his story simply perfect.

155
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,700
What do we do? Will you lose?

156
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,790
I...

157
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,340
Why don't you listen to my story first

158
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,510
before making up your mind?

159
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,630
Please.

160
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,390
Mine is a story

161
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,670
about a goldfish who travels to wilderness

162
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,430
and reincarnates as a sea whale.

163
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,580
A goldfish going back to its ancestors?

164
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,990
Chu Li,

165
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,990
you know me the best.

166
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,960
Didn't you say it's a carp?

167
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,110
Carp is no fun. I'm talking about

168
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,110
going back to hundred of
generations of ancestors.

169
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,660
And that's oriental fantasy.

170
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,830
Otherwise, I could just
write a documentary.

171
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,390
Pass me the laptop. I'll see for myself.

172
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,310
My story,

173
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,790
it's what I wanted to say.

174
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,460
Jiang Yu Chen, can you

175
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,870
stop doing meaningless stuff?

176
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,190
I find them meaningful.

177
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,220
I've been thinking a lot
these past few days.

178
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,510
We're not suitable for each other.

179
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,790
In what way?

180
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,230
You and I are too alike.

181
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,900
We live for ourselves.

182
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,910
I'm selfish in nature.

183
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,030
If I don't fight for myself,

184
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,990
no one will.

185
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,390
I didn't tell you about

186
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,900
Yun Fei plagiarizing your work.

187
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,470
Yeah.

188
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,860
To put it mildly,
that's my professional ethics.

189
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,870
But truth be told,

190
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,990
it's a selfish decision that I made.

191
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,150
I didn't consider your feelings.

192
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,790
I was at fault as well.

193
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,510
I didn't trust you.

194
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,910
We know too well

195
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,590
how our relationship was going.

196
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,830
You encountered 
a bottleneck in your career.

197
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,070
Yet, I kept

198
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,470
pressuring you.

199
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,940
And me? I didn't even dare go home.

200
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,630
Because I had no idea how to face you.

201
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,470
And we ended up

202
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,750
not talking to one another.

203
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,110
Our relationship was over long ago.

204
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,910
Let's give it another try.

205
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,470
It'll be different.

206
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,190
Do we need to do so?

207
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,870
You and I.

208
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,780
Two selfish persons.

209
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,220
I don't want to be your enemy.

210
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,750
That's that.

211
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,150
Don't bother yourself.

212
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,390
You incorporated 
the genre of oriental fantasy

213
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,470
with war and love?

214
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,590
Yeah.

215
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,110
In the end, humans will

216
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,750
travel back to the sea from the the sewer.

217
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,310
It reminds me of

218
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,590
that group of sea whales.

219
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,150
The young whales

220
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,830
keep waiting in that territory

221
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,190
for the return of other whales.

222
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,430
Just like

223
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,950
the girl who guards the City of War
and refuses to leave.

224
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,910
And she encounters Bird Boy.

225
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,430
You don't write love stories, do you?

226
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,950
Well, I

227
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,870
didn't know how.

228
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,950
It's totally different from
your usual style.

229
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,350
And it's pretty mind-blowing.

230
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,270
I started my career 
by writing oriental fantasy stories.

231
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,790
And I'm the best at creating
mind-boggling stories.

232
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,510
So,

233
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,150
do you still think that
Jiang Yu Cheng will definitely win?

234
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,110
Now

235
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,030
I'm not so sure anymore.

236
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,670
Not so sure?

237
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,950
Not sure.

238
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,590
Great.

239
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,110
Hello.

240
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,310
Hello.

241
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,430
Please have your seat.

242
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,900
Please.

243
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,310
I like Chinese mainland very much.

244
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,950
My Mandarin is not so good.

245
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,470
But I understand it a little.

246
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,950
Within a short period of time,

247
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,590
both of you managed to come up with
such complete short stories.

248
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,460
That's very admirable.

249
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,710
Particularly Jiang Yu Cheng's work.

250
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,910
It's very

251
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,590
vivid.

252
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,150
It incorporates traditional Chinese legend

253
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,550
and reflects on human nature.
I found it profound.

254
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,390
Both of you managed to produce

255
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,110
two complete short stories

256
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,110
within a short period of time.

257
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,630
Mr Maurer found it very admirable.

258
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,470
Especially Mr Jiang Yu Cheng's work.

259
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,030
It's really vivid.

260
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,350
Also, it incorporates

261
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,270
traditional Chinese legend

262
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,830
and reflects on human nature.

263
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,310
He found it really profound.

264
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,990
Thank you.

265
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,470
Mr Maurer.

266
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,260
Mr Jiang has had

267
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,900
collaborations with famous directors.

268
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,590
He will make changes to his work

269
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,540
based on the project requirements.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,980
After all, movie making

271
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,430
is different from novel writing.

272
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,110
It's the result of cooperation from all.

273
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,590
As for Mr Zhou Chuan,

274
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,910
As for Mr Zhou Chuan,

275
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,670
your writing style is entirely different

276
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,300
from Mr Jiang Cheng's.

277
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,950
It's very creative.

278
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,350
Mr Maurer still needs to reflect on

279
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,350
many parts in it.

280
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,470
But he'd like to ask you a question.

281
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,910
If we were to work together on a movie,

282
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,390
would you still

283
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,670
do things your own way?

284
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,630
It's my writing style.

285
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,910
It's been years. And I've never
changed it for anyone.

286
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,630
I feel very honoured to be given

287
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,350
a chance

288
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,140
and talk to you here, Mr Maurer.

289
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,340
But to me,

290
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,390
when a partner

291
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,590
is considering me,

292
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,790
I'm considering him, too.

293
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,270
What were you saying?

294
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,590
What did you say?

295
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,750
Mr Zhou Chuan is too obstinate.

296
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,470
Perhaps

297
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,350
he's not suitable for collaboration.

298
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,390
I don't feel quite well.

299
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,070
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,510
I need to excuse myself.

301
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,860
Mr Maurer feels a bit unwell.

302
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,470
He's sorry, but he needs to leave first.

303
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,870
Mr Maurer, please wait.

304
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,110
Could you hear me out?

305
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,870
She'd like to have some words with you.

306
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,950
I like your first book

307
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,950
very much.

308
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,550
The Engraved Traces of Dragon.

309
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,910
And I'm aware

310
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,310
you don't like to be reminded of it.

311
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,710
You don't like others to talk about it

312
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,100
because you think

313
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,349
their interpretations

314
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,109
have gone against
the original intention of your writing.

315
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,150
And it's no longer the result
of you writing freely.

316
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,750
The same goes for Zhou Chuan.

317
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,150
For a writer,

318
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,150
freedom

319
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,390
is a lifetime happiness.

320
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,109
In order to come up with a vivid piece,

321
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,430
he needs to write by his heart.

322
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,339
Alright.

323
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,589
Enjoy the food.

324
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,430
Help yourself.

325
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,869
I...

326
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,270
Thank you all for today.

327
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,670
You may stay and enjoy the dinner.

328
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,670
I believe

329
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,070
Mr Maurer will give us

330
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,110
his final answer tomorrow.

331
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,220
Excuse me.

332
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,150
Live well with your new friends.

333
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,750
According to the theory of
goldfish going back to ancestors,

334
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,990
that goldfish has probably
turned into a carp.

335
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,710
And they might have reunited.

336
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,470
Why don't you seem to mind about

337
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,070
the selection result?

338
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,060
Well, my girlfriend offended Maurer

339
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,310
and stood up for me.

340
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,820
Who would care about the result?

341
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,150
Why didn't I realise that

342
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,830
you're a lovesick man?

343
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,390
Oh, right.

344
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,390
When did you learn French?

345
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,790
I always read his books in French.

346
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,310
You didn't notice that?

347
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,950
I didn't.

348
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,350
You don't care about me.
Yet, you're interrogating me.

349
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,030
No.

350
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,310
When you're reading,

351
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,270
I can't keep my eyes off

352
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,230
your extremely handsome side face.

353
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,270
That's an acceptable excuse.

354
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
Don't worry.

355
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,030
You'll get another chance

356
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,710
from Maurer.

357
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,270
-Hello.
-Hi.

358
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,030
Hello.

359
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,190
I gave it another thought yesterday.

360
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,230
Mr Maurer

361
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,110
gave it another thought last night.

362
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,670
He'd like to ask Mr Zhou Chuan this.

363
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,710
Are you sure you want to stick to

364
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,070
your writing style?

365
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,710
Yes.

366
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,110
Yes.

367
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,710
Without the freedom to
express one's wishes,

368
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,150
Without the freedom to
express one's wishes,

369
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,470
how can one be a writer?

370
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,030
That's why Mr Maurer finds

371
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,630
Mr Zhou Chuan's attitude deeply admirable.

372
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,390
Ms Chu Li was right.

373
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,060
Mr Maurer refused to admit

374
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,150
that The Engraved Traces of Dragon

375
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,460
is his work.

376
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,590
It's exactly because
others' interpretations

377
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,030
have gone against his intention.

378
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,350
Thus,

379
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,910
Mr Maurer understands

380
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,390
Mr Zhou Chuan's belief that

381
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,790
he wants to write freely

382
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,070
and stick to his writing style.

383
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,070
Mr Maurer, thank you

384
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,030
for not minding what I said.

385
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,750
The creative ideas...

386
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,990
The creative ideas

387
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,980
in Mr Zhou Chuan's short story,

388
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,510
Mr Maurer was very surprised

389
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,790
by them.

390
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,270
Of course, regarding
the difficulties of collaboration,

391
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,830
Mr Maurer is always

392
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,270
up for challenges.

393
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,590
That's why he'd like to invite you to be

394
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,350
his movie partner.

395
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,750
He's wondering if you're up for it.

396
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,230
Of course, it'd be my pleasure.

397
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,870
Of course, I admire...

398
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,030
Of course,

399
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,390
Mr Maurer admires

400
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,230
Jiang Yu Cheng's writing as well.

401
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,750
He hopes he can work with you next time.

402
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,590
Thank you.

403
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,070
Thank you.

404
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,670
Won't you come and comfort me?

405
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,030
After all,

406
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,950
we've been teammates
for the past two days.

407
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,030
You'll have another chance next time.

408
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,110
Whatever.

409
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,190
If it hadn't been for you,

410
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,430
I wouldn't have come.

411
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,990
What you said yesterday,

412
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,510
I slept on it.

413
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,790
If you think we're not
suitable for each other,

414
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,990
I'll change it.

415
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,300
Change what?

416
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,390
I'll make us suitable for one another.

417
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,540
This is the most relaxing moment
I've had since I came here.

418
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,670
The scenery here is so beautiful.

419
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,470
It's because you're with someone.

420
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,750
How narcissistic you are.

421
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,030
Oh, right.

422
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,590
I find your experience of
writing your debut novel

423
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,550
very similar to that of Maurer's.

424
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,700
So it's destined

425
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,190
that he could choose you.

426
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,670
They're similar.

427
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,590
And they're not.

428
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,230
At least Maurer's debut novel

429
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,230
is an acknowledged work.

430
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,070
And mine

431
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,340
is a joke for some.

432
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,470
Who said so?

433
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,620
I read all the news about Maurer.

434
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,030
He once found his debut novel

435
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,270
a joke.

436
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,710
Until a literature forum

437
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,070
gave his debut novel high praise.

438
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,870
He's called the humblest

439
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,510
and purest soul among all the literati.

440
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,830
Some will see the good in you.

441
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,100
Just like me.

442
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,630
It turned out to be

443
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,630
a self-praise.

444
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,110
You've had enough compliments.

445
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,910
You're so brilliant after all.

446
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,510
Hi, I'd like to check out.

447
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,580
Sure, give me a minute.

448
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,470
Brat.

449
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,350
You're lucky.

450
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,590
It's not luck.

451
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,190
I got it in my own right.

452
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,350
Yeah.

453
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,070
You've lived for more than twenty years.

454
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,990
And someone finally realised your worth.

455
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,550
You lost. There's no use crying about it.

456
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,910
Shall I make you a pennant

457
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,150
and hang it on your door?

458
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,070
One that says,
"Congratulations to Zhou Chuan

459
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,910
for surpassing the kid next door for now."

460
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,230
As in temporarily surpassing me.

461
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,790
Congratulations, Chu Li.

462
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,390
Thank you, Director Gu.

463
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,430
Mr Zhou Chuan

464
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,150
get to collaborate with Maurer.

465
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,230
He'll be famous than ever.

466
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,230
I'm afraid others will get jealous.

467
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,110
So don't let him show off too much.

468
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,630
Got it. Thank you for
your advice, Director Gu.

469
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,070
Let's get going, then.

470
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,910
See you next time.

471
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,060
Bye.

472
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,070
Let's go.

473
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,310
Chu Li.

474
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,070
Good morning.

475
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,350
Chu Li, I'd like to ask you this.

476
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,940
How's Mr Zhou Chuan and Mr Maurer's script

477
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,190
coming along?

478
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,990
Xiang, you've been asking me

479
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,660
this question for the past three months.

480
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,790
Aren't you tired of it?

481
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,150
I'm not.

482
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,870
Who would complain about
knowing too much about their idols?

483
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,870
Ever since Mr Maurer made
the official announcement

484
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,220
that he's collaborating
with Mr Zhou Chuan,

485
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,510
we readers have been
waiting for an update.

486
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,670
It should be going quite smoothly.

487
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,430
At least he's not complaining about

488
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,990
not getting used to
script writing like he did.

489
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,990
That's great.

490
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,430
Chu Li.

491
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,380
Can I visit the set

492
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,670
with you?

493
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,390
They're not even done with
the script writing yet.

494
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,390
Chu Li.

495
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,790
Get over here.

496
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,910
What's it?

497
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,590
I received a phone call this morning.

498
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,390
Someone wants to buy
the rights to Book of Luo He God.

499
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,100
Who?

500
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,980
Song Xi?

501
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,270
Who's that? I don't know her.

502
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,670
Oh my God.

503
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,070
How can you not know Song Xi?

504
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,950
She's the hottest
female celebrity of the year.

505
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,230
She just received

506
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,230
the White Mulan best actress award.

507
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,670
Don't you read news?

508
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,030
I've been busy writing
the script for Maurer.

509
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,030
I don't have time for that.

510
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,470
What have you been writing about?

511
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,420
It's a secret.

512
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,070
Our relationship has lost its spark.

513
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,190
You even keep that from me.

514
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,590
Fine, what should we do?

515
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,380
Meet up with Song Xi.

516
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,630
Jeez.

517
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,270
Yuan Yue Publishing House isn't
in charge of copyright authorisation.

518
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,790
Even if the rights to
Book of Luo He God is sold,

519
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,510
you won't receive any commission.

520
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,870
So why do you try to talk me into it?

521
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,710
Of course it's because of you.

522
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,990
We're talking about Song Xi.

523
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,070
If you collaborate with her,

524
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,030
surely many will be interested in it.

525
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,540
When Jiang Yu Chen was
adapting his novel into a movie,

526
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,300
you found him Director Lu Fang.

527
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,620
Why did you find me

528
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,030
a female celebrity?

529
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,830
What's the problem with it?

530
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,110
You need to stop being prejudiced
against female artists.

531
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,070
She's just become famous. And now she's
trying to purchase intellectual property.

532
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,510
And she will hire
screenwriters by herself.

533
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,750
It's her first work. So she'll definitely
put a lot of effort into it.

534
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,550
How do you know she's not

535
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,070
trying to create a buzz with it?

536
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,910
We're not even sure
if she's read the book.

537
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,990
Just go.

538
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,270
If she's not sincere about it,

539
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,110
just don't collaborate with her.

540
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,430
Fine, you're the boss.

541
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,750
I'll make an appointment
with Chief Editor Yu.

542
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,470
Oh, right. Can I tag along?

543
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,350
This is your true intention, right?

544
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,820
You just want to meet her.

545
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,270
Why do you like her so much?

546
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,030
Just a little bit.

547
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,740
Here, this question.

548
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,030
Solve this question.

549
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,590
Didn't you solve it incorrectly?

550
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,720
[Chu Li]

551
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,830
[Chief Editor Yu.]

552
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,470
[Mr Zhou Chuan agreed to have a meetup.]

553
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,550
[Shall we arrange a time for it?]

554
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,350
Hello?

555
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,190
Hi.

556
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,750
Yeah, you reached out to me.

557
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,990
Yes.

558
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,670
My editor has contacted

559
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,740
Mr Zhou Chuan.

560
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,790
Let me know when you're available.

561
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,670
Yes, that's right.

562
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,110
Mum, I want some water.

563
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,780
Yes, anytime you're...

564
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,150
-Mum, I want to drink water.
-Please send me...

565
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,670
An address will do.

566
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,470
What's going on?

567
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,030
I'm sorry.

568
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,110
-Qiu Qiu.
-Sure. That's right.

569
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,750
-Qiu Qiu, don't cry.
-Sure. Got it.

570
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,950
I'll get you some water, okay?

571
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,590
Let's go.

572
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,990
Why are you home so late?

573
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,430
I was working overtime.

574
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,390
You're home early.

575
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,670
But did you leave your heart
at the publishing house?

576
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,470
Can't you stop acting
like this all the time?

577
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,950
What's wrong with me
making a business phone call?

578
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,110
It's not about that.

579
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,510
Our kid was thirsty.

580
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,030
And you're still working.

581
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,630
What a responsible mother you are.

582
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,580
Daddy. Mummy. Stop fighting.

583
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,670
Okay, got it, my baby.

584
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,550
Got it.

585
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,340
Don't cry, my baby.

586
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,470
We'll stop fighting.

587
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,470
Qiu Qiu, be good.

588
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,750
We're not fighting. Qiu Qiu, don't cry.

589
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,740
We're just talking.

590
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,430
Let's get back to your bedroom, okay?

591
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,590
Let's go.

592
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,710
Qiu Qiu.

593
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,510
What are you doing?

594
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,990
The kid is home.
So I don't want to fight with you.

595
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,630
But Yu Yao,

596
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,070
let's have a divorce.

597
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Li Wei.

598
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,110
Are you aware what you're saying?

599
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,710
I've been meaning to say it for so long.

600
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,390
I'm tired already.

601
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,590
I can't do this anymore.

602
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,390
Be honest with me.

603
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,380
Have you been having an affair?

604
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,150
You always put the blame on others.

605
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,060
I can put up with your other shortcomings.

606
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,590
But you mistreat our kid.

607
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,270
And I can't tolerate that
for another minute.

608
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,590
You put your work

609
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,980
before me and Qiu Qiu.

610
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,190
Yu Yao, ask yourself.

611
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,070
Do you still care about this family?

612
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,870
I seriously don't get it.

613
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,110
You're a woman.

614
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,590
But you don't put your family first.

615
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,180
Give it a thought.

616
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,500
Contact me once you've made up your mind.

617
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,390
Also,

618
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,030
I'll have

619
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,390
Qiu Qiu's custody.

620
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,390
She's on leave?

621
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,700
Through my three years working here,

622
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,140
she's never on leave.

623
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,430
Even though she's sick,
she still came to work.

624
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,310
Could it be a serious illness?

625
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,390
I don't know.

626
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,630
But Chief Editor Yu
has been looking unwell lately.

627
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,070
[I'm worried about Chief Editor Yu.]

628
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,710
[She didn't come to work today.
You should go ahead first.]

629

[Chu Li]

630
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,550
How does my makeup look?

631
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,790
It's not smudged.

632
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,070
It looks very nice.

633
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,190
Zhou Chuan will definitely

634
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,070
stunned by your looks.

635
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,230
Sir, this way please.

636
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,830
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

637
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,390
I'm Song Xi.

638
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,980
Hi.

639
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,590
This is my assistant, Na Na.

640
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,110
-Hi.
-Hi.

641
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,110
Have we ever met before?

642
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,950
I don't think so.

643
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,590
In fact, many find Na Na

644
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,710
very familiar.

645
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,150
Maybe I have an average face.

646
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,910
I didn't expect the author
of Book of Luo He God

647
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,940
to be this young.

648
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,260
You're a brilliant young man indeed.

649
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,070
Take a seat first.

650
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:12,870
Sure.

651
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,230
Feel free to ask me

652
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,510
questions about the copyright.

653
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,990
Na Na.

654
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,390
Ask them to serve the dishes.

655
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,550
Ms Song, what's your favourite part

656
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,750
from Book of Luo He God?

657
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,750
I'd say it's the part when
Sha Jia Ye's identity is exposed.

658
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,790
Isn't Sui Xing's reaction so adorable?

659
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,110
I think it's so-so.

660
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,990
It's not my most favourite part.

661
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,220
I'm all ears.

662
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,350
My most favourite part

663
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,670
is when Qinyue Island is destroyed.

664
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,700
Mr Zhou, you're full of humour.

665
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,390
Qinyue Island is Sui Xing's hometown.

666
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,070
In the Chapter of Netherworld,

667
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,550
Sha Jia Ye almost loses his life

668
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,550
from protecting Sui Xing's hometown.

669
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,950
And that's exactly the reason

670
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,550
why Qinyue Island is saved.

671
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,220
Destroying is part of the process.

672
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,420
The result is it's saved from
being destroyed.

673
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,270
You're right, Mr Zhou.

674
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,180
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

675
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,910
Hello? Ms Suo Heng.

676
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,190
Did you manage to
get hold of Chief Editor Yu?

677
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,950
No, she hasn't replied to my message.

678
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,750
[I tried to reach her.
But she didn't pick up her phone.]

679
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,030
I'll head to her place.

680
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,670
[Sure, let's meet there.]

681
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,980
[I'm going to Chief Editor Yu's place.]

682
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,230
[I can't make it.]

683
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,060
[Have a good talk with Song Xi.]

684
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,970
[Little Monkey]

685
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,390
Since you've read the novel,

686
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,750
you should be aware that

687
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,740
there's no main female character in it.

688
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,940
And since you're planning to buy the IP,

689
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,630
which character do you want to play?

690
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,430
Don't worry, Mr Zhou.

691
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,910
I don't plan to include

692
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,630
any love scene in it.

693
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,150
I'd like to play Sui Xing's sister,

694
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,270
Lan Yue.

695
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,830
You have good taste.

696
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,070
I'd like to make changes to the adaptation

697
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,070
by adding family scenes between
Lan Yue and Sui Xing.

698
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,710
As for other characters and plots,

699
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,070
I'll retain 70% of what's in the book.

700
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,949
As for other 30%,

701
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,429
I hope Mr Zhou

702
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,420
could make a compromise
for the dramatisation.

703
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,230
I thought you'd say that

704
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,670
it'd be entirely based on the book.

705
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,210
No one dares talk boastfully like that.

706
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,710
Also, I prefer
a sincere collaboration talk.

707
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,870
Book of Luo He God
is an oriental fantasy novel.

708
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,110
I think it's hard to retain

709
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,750
even 70% of what's in the book.

710
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,940
Here's the proposal.

711
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,270
The screenwriters, director,

712
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,070
and post-production crew members
are all written on it.

713
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,310
I can promise you that

714
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,270
I'll definitely talk this team

715
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,590
into joining it.

716
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,179
It's the greatest sincerity from me.

717
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,510
Fine, I'll give it a thought.

718
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,830
I've got something on. I'm taking off.

719

Mr Zhou, see you next time.

721
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,590
I finally met him.

Chief Editor Yu!

725
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,430
Are you home?

726
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,110
Why are you here?

727
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,620
You don't look well.

728
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,150
Are you sick?

729
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,190
Chu Li said you've been

730
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,590
absent from work.

731
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,750
Chief Editor Yu.

732
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,660
Are you alright?

733
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,860
What exactly happened?

734
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,470
Where's Qiu Qiu?

735
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,110
Why are Li Wei and Qiu Qiu not around?

736
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,830
Qiu Qiu

737
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,310
is at my mom's place.

738
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,070

739
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,420
He's left.

740
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,710
Left?

741
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,510
Is he on a business trip?

742
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,430
He wants to have a divorce with me.

743
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,070
Divorce?

744
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,750
He said

745
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,950
I put all my heart

746
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,150
into my work.

747
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,950
That I don't care about him and Qiu Qiu.

748
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,710
He's been putting up with me.

749
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,260
And he doesn't want to anymore.

750
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,110
I thought

751
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,270
everything would turn out fine

752
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,070
since he's finally back.

753
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,310
It's just my wishful thinking.

754
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,070
Wait.

755
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,430
How can he so irresponsible?

756
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,910
What about Qiu Qiu?

757
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,870
He said he's getting Qiu Qiu's custody.

758
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,350
But I won't let him have it.

759
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,230
Sis Yao Yao.

760
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,910
It's such a serious matter. How can you
carry it all on your shoulders?

761
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,110
Why didn't you tell me?

762
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,430
I know.

763
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,990
I'm not a good mother.

764
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,990
I spend too little time with Qiu Qiu.

765
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,950
I owe him.

766
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,550
But

767
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,510
I risked my life

768
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,820
and was pregnant for ten months

769
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,460
before giving birth to Qiu Qiu.

770
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,670
He's my life.

771
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,590
There's no way I'm losing him.

772
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,350
I won't let him take Qiu Qiu away!

773
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,950
It's okay.

774
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,350
I really can't imagine

775
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,350
what it looks like to lose Qiu Qiu.

776
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,550
Do you understand?

777
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,190
You're not going to lose him.

778
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,420
You won't lose Qiu Qiu.

779
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,990
It's alright.

780
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,230
I really don't know what to do!

781
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,750
It's going to be okay.

782
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,470
Everything will be fine.

783
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,560
[Zhou Chuan, Author]

784
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,990
He's still the same person
from high school days.

785
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,910
He hasn't changed a bit.

786
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,100
His smile

787
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,550
looks as good.

788
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,790
He was even testing me

789
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,790
if I've ever read his book.

790
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,350
How silly.

791
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,910
I've read each of his books

792
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,710
for more than three times.

793
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,510
Zhou Chuan seems to
value his works very much.

794
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,460
No wonder he tested you.

795
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,710
I don't need you to remind me.

796
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,590
Who know him? Me or you?

797
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,750
Of course it's you.

798
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,870
But Xi Xi,

799
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,590
doesn't Zhou Chuan have a girlfriend?

800
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,270
So what?

801
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,230
Is his girlfriend prettier than me?

802
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,990
Does she know him better than me?

803
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,470
And...

804
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,790
Does she like him more than I do?

805
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,510
Of course not.

806
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,510
Xi Xi.

807
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,070
If Zhou Chuan figures out

808
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,350
that you've liked him all these years,

809
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,030
he'll definitely be moved.

810
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,310
Anyway,

811
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,870
he managed to remember

812
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,390
this face of yours.

813
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,420
We're all from the same high school.

814
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,620
I haven't changed much.

815
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,940
I'm no match for you, Xi Xi.

816
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,140
You're so beautiful now.

817
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,070
Indeed.

818
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,740
No one

819
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,670
deserves him but me.

820
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,340
Director, someone is here to see you.

821
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,030
Who's it? Is there an appointment?

822
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,110
It's Mr Jiang Yu Chen.

823
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,950
I'm not seeing him.

824
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,470
I'm at work.

825
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,990
I'm here for a business talk.

826
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,300
My new book.

827
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,830
Check it out, Director Gu.

828
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,630
What are you doing?

829
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,590
I promised you

830
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,110
that I'd let you have my new work.

831
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,940
Then let me arrange a new...

832
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,870
No need.

833
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,260
I just want you.

834
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,390
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

835
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,470
Gu Bai Zhi.

836
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,150
I said I wouldn't give up.

837
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,870
We can slowly work it out.

838
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,670
We'll start with this book.

839
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,510
Let's have a new start.

840
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,990
Have you been writing
for the past three months?

841
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,590
Yeah.

842
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,550
Back then,

843
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,510
I wasn't a good listener.

844
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,990
From now on, I'll listen to you.

845
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,910
If

846
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,230
we're not on the same page,

847
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,670
I'll do my best to communicate with you.

848
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,390
I'll never reject your ideas again.

849
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,790
From now on,

850
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,350
I'll believe you.

851
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,540
Two conditions.

852
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,110
Number one. We don't talk about
personal stuff while working.

853
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,070
Number two.

854
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,670
Outside of work, we don't interfere in

855
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,550
each other's personal life.

856
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,710
Doesn't Song Xi want to buy your rights?

857
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,110
How did the negotiation go?

858
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,790
It's so-so.

859
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,070
That's that.

860
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,540
You're something else.

861
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,670
First came Maurer.

862
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,830
And then came Song Xi.

863
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,990
You're going places.

864
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,870
You're doing well with your career.
But you don't play tennis well.

865
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,550
But I'm better than somebody else.

866
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,990
He plays tennis well.

867
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,670
But he doesn't do well with his love life.

868
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,150
In order to court your ex-girlfriend,

869
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,590
you signed the contract with Xin Dun.

870
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,180
Didn't your courage

871
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,430
spark up the old flame?

872
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,140
I'll take it slowly.

873
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,470
Let me ask you something.

874
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,860
Do you want my help?

875
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,990
You?

876
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,870
I'd appreciate if
you could stay out of it.

877
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,310
Fine.

878
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,470
Gu Bai Zhi is coming to my place tonight.

879
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,350
And you're not invited.

880
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,510
She's going to your place?

881
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,670
Why is she doing that?

882
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,670
How do you plan to help me?

883
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,910
I gave you my help
when you're fighting with Chu Li.

884
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,190
Wait, Zhou Chuan.

885
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,000
How could you turn against me?
