00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,820
Ah Xiang, what happened?

5
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,030
Chu Li,

6
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,310
Miao invited the famous

7
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,870
Yi Shui Han over to do the warm-up.

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,910
He doesn't have to do anything.

9
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,150
He came here to sign
autograph and take photo.

10
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,670
There are many cosplayers in there.

11
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,190
Isn't this ridiculous?

12
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,050
Do the superiors know about this?

13
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,070
We've sold

14
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,590
a thousand books in less than an hour.

15
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,830
Mr Liang is very happy.

16
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,940
The worse is that

17
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,190
they want to change
Mr Zhou Chuan's display board

18
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,990
to Yi Shui Han's display board.

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,120
Who dares to do that?

20
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,310
-Excuse me! Excuse me!
-Excuse me! Excuse me!

21
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,710
Excuse me!

Carry Mr Yi Shui Han's

24
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,110
display board out.

25
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,710
You...

26
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,420
Why are you putting
Mr Zhou Chuan's display board here?

27
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,620
Put it back!

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,829
Deputy Editor Miao has said it.

29
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,070
There're too many people. He's afraid
the display board will be broken.

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,190
So he asked us to put Mr Zhou Chuan's

31
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,190
display board away.

32
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,950
And take it out on the premiere date.

33
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,590
He did it to protect our company's

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,390
important goods from damaging.

35
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,430
Is that so?

36
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,030
Then why don't you leave

37
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,510
Mr Yi Shui Han's display board here?

38
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,950
They are the important goods
of our company anyway.

39
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,230
We should treat them the same way.

40
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:48,910
You...

41
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,070
Put it back

42
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,390
or I'll cut Mr Yi Shui Han's

43
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,590

44
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,470
Chu Li, calm down.

45
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,870
It'll be hard for you to
explain to the leader.

46
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,630
I'll count to three.

47
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,660
I'll do it

48
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,990
if you don't put it back.

49
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,500
All right.

50
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,190

51
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,830
move this out.

52
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,750

Ask Miao

56
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,070
to make the deal with
the other character

57
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,430
for Yuan Yue platform.

58
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,550
Okay.

59
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,230
What are you doing?

60
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,430
Are you demolishing?

61
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,430
Mr Liang,

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,550
I want to discuss something with you.

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,870
Are you free?

64
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,470
No, get out.

65
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,710
About the marketing publicity
of this book fair,

66
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,990
I would like to share some idea.

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,670
What?

68
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,670
Publicity?

69
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,510
Idea?

70
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,910
It's not a problem
if you want to invite a cosplayer.

71
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,910
Two-dimensional world
is about positivity.

72
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,470
But it's not a right timing.

73
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,140
Tomorrow is the premiere
of Book of Luo He God.

74
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,390
What if Mr Zhou Chuan's readers
couldn't get in

75
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,470
if they want to buy his book?

76
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,910
Didn't you say you want to
sign his new book over?

77
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,500
Isn't that insincere if you do this?

78
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,829
You're right.

79
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,790
Keep going.

80
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,990
So, can you cancel

81
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,510
tomorrow's role play activity?

82
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,590
Okay.

83
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,990
Here, have a seat.

84
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,910
I'll listen to you if you sit here.

85
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,830
Sit.

86
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,070
What are you doing?

87
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,830
Chief Editor Yu.

88
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,830
Your editorial department

89
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,790
dropped in unannounced.

90
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,010
Do you think my office is a market?

91
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,220
Mr Liang, don't joke on me.

92
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,790
In comparison to here,

93
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,830
Yuan Yue Publishing House's booth

94
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,670
is like a market.

95
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,350
Mr Xia went to receive

96
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,110
his friends.

97
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,030
He asked me to communicate with you.

98
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,070
When can the booth of

99
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,470
Yuan Yue Publishing House
turn from Comic-Con to a book fair?

100
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,430
Hello.

101
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,070
Mr Yang.

102
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,630
Yes.

103
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,310
Rest assured.

104
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,630
I've been discussing
about the cosplaying.

105
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,300
Right, no problem.

106
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,150
They will keep an eye on it.

107
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,030
Right!

108
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,070
Okay, leave it to me.

109
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,990
Goodbye.

110
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,750
Have you listened it?

111
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,270
Hiring the cosplayer is an exemption
which is granted by Director Yang.

112
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,510
Please pass the message to Mr Xia.

113
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,870
The role-playing platform will be

114
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,270
lasted until the end.

115
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,470
As for Book of Luo He God,

116
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,190
we'll open two more passageways by then.

117
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,710
And hire someone to maintain the order.

118
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,390
What's big deal?

119
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,540
Everything is under my control.

120
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,030
But this...

121
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,670
Okay, just stop.

122
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,200
It's useless to speak much.

123
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,550
Let's go.

124
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,830
Gu Bai Zhi, why is it you?

125
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,230
You can't just drop by

126
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,940
even if we live nearby.

127
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,340
Open the door,
I have something to tell you.

128
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,030
What is it?

129
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,550
Are you busy writing Huang Quan Inn?

130
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,150
It's a mess on your Weibo.

131
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,280
Don't you know that?

132
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,550
Weibo?

133
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,320
What's going on?

134
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,909
Yuan Yue Publishing House is outrageous.

135
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,310
It's not enough for just one cosplayer.

136
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,710
Tomorrow is the launch day
of Book of Luo He God.

137
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,230
Yet they still wanted to hire
two more cosplayers.

138
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,110
But your little editor

139
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,710
really worked hard for you.

140
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,750
She went up

141
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,110
against them

142
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,909
just for your display board.

143
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,870
What's going on?

144
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,470
Why are you coming to me?

145
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,190
Tomorrow night,

146
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,750
Xin Dun Books prepares

147
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,830
a banquet to welcome Maurer.

148
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm here to invite you to the banquet.

149
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,230
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,780
I'm not planning to sign

151
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,790
the serial rights of Huang Quan Inn
over to Xin Dun Books.

152
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,720
Don't tell me you're going to sign it
over to Yuan Yue Publishing House.

153
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,390
Er Gou, I'm back.

154
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,830
I'm back.

155
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,380
You're back?

156
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,350
I...

157
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,110
I... I mean,

158
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,190
Mr Zhou Chuan, I'm back to bother you.

159
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,030
These are the stuffs
that you asked me to buy.

160
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,340
You guys continue. I'm going.

161
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,190
Your relationship
with this little editor...

162
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,470
Is not that simple.

163
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,110
There's someone in the house.

164
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,790
I'd better walk around

165
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,990
for a while before I go back.

166
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,790
Are you planning to

167
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,310
stay out for

168
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,510
two hours if she was
to stay that long?

169
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,990
Two hours?

170
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,710
Why does she want to stay that long?

171
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,670
Is she

172
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,630
going to stay for supper?

173
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,070
That was just a metaphor.

174
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,270
Do you know metaphor?

175
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,140
I think I should
find a place where I can sit

176
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,460
then I'll go back after a while.

177
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,429
Just send me a message

178
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,960
after Director Gu has left.

179
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,270
She lives nearby.

180
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,710
You guys will meet someday.

181
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,570
How many times do you plan to hide?

182
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,450
I'll hide every time I see her.

183
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,750
It's unnecessary.

184
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,350
It's like we're cheating.

185
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,390
Mr Zhou Chuan, slow down.

186
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,620
I don't want to go in.

187
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,390
Hello, Director Gu.

188
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,390
What a coincidence. We meet again.

189
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,190
Both of you...

190
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,900
She is now my tenant

191
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,100
and I'm her landlord.

192
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,540
Right.

193
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,670
I rented Mr Zhou Chuan's second floor.

194
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,070
Mr Zhou Chuan is a nice person.
He knew I'm homeless

195
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,910
so...

196
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,030
I'm not going to hide it

197
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,430
since you've seen us.

198
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,710
But I hope that
you could keep it as secret.

199
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,630
A man and a woman
lives in the same house.

200
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,350
It's hard for people not
to have impure thoughts.

201
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,380
And you'll get affected

202
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,710
if your readers know it.

203
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,350
I don't mind.

204
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,750
I think

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,950
it will affect Chu Li's reputation

206
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,390
if this gets out

207
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,590
since she is a lady.

208
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,220
Then I'll let you two be.

209
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Just send me

210
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,370
a message if you want to go.

211
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,790
I'll leave first.

212
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,550
If you want to go?

213
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,810
Where do you want to go?

214
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,770
She invited me to meet Maurer.

215
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,230
I think she's trying to get
Huang Quan Inn's serial rights.

216
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,510
I finally finished writing Huang Quan Inn.

217
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,230
Why is my shoulder this sore?

218
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,790
Dear Mr Zhou Chuan,

219
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,900
when can we sign the contract?

220
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,100
Tomorrow after the book fair,

221
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,700
bring the contract with you.

222
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,830
Rest assured.

223
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,910
I'll try my best to complete the mission.

224
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,230
Be gentle.

225
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,210
Are you trying to break a rock?

226
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,510
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

227
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,070
I'm fine.

228
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,670
Okay, I'll be right there.

229
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,550
Qiu Qiu is sick, you don't have to go.

230
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,340
I'll report it to you at night.

231
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,750
You just came back.
Are you going to

232
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,210
the editorial department
at this late hour?

233
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,820
It's nothing.

234
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,460
Something urgent has come up
in the editorial department.

235
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,150
Just order the delivery
if you're hungry.

236
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,950
I'll leave first.

237
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,830
I...

238
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,710
How about this?

239
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,590
Let's meet

240
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,790
each other halfway.

241
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,350
The editorial department
already compromised.

242
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,870
We just ask to suspend tomorrow's

243
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,390
comic exhibition for one day.

244
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,660
Tomorrow is the national

245
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,350
launch day of
Book of Luo He God with limited copies.

246
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,390
Based on the minimum of
respect for the author,

247
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,630
shouldn't the unrelated activities

248
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,030
be suspended?

249
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,390
Is there a conflict
between these two activities?

250
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,390
Why are you

251
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,120
putting all eggs in one basket?

252
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,510
Mr Xia,

253
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,950
I think this is a win-win situation.

254
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,510
Mr Liang,

255
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,310
do you know that tomorrow,

256
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,470
Xin Dun Books has invited
world-renowned author

257
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,350
and director, Maurer over?

258
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,470
At this point, Yuan Yue

259
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,790
is still not focusing

260
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,230
on Mr Zhou Chuan

261
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,750
but to hire some cosplayers
and hold Comic-Con.

262
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,430
Aren't the priorities being misplaced?

263
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,910
Right, I've misplaced the priorities.

264
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,950
Okay.

265
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,950
Hitting two millions copies

266
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,350
in three days,

267
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,620
you do it.

268
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,430
I'm from the editorial department,

269
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,990
not the circulation department.

270
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,150
I don't know much about these things.

271
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,830
But I know the practical realization
of the win-win situation

272
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,550
is to maximize the sales
in the book fair under the premise

273
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,350
of protecting the author.

274
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,630
You can search for
Mr Zhou Chuan's Weibo.

275
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,070
The readers of Mr Zhou Chuan

276
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,230
are dissatisfied with
Yuan Yue Publishing House now.

277
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,150
Mr Zhou Chuan always
cherishes his readers.

278
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,430
This situation is no good for us.

279
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,550
I'm impressed.

280
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,230
Mr Xia,

281
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,590
Miao,

282
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,670
I think

283
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,350
Chu Li has transformed.

284
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,870
She has made a great progress.

285
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,100
She has lots of

286
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
well-reasoned theories
and they are in simple terms.

287
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,300
I think

288
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,830
you are Mr Zhou Chuan's top fan

289
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,490
and you are the one
who are dissatisfied with us.

290
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,910
Just that you haven't
hold Zhou Chuan's hands

291
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,710
to the book fair and told him that

292
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,740
this is the kingdom

293
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,790
you establish for him.

294
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,070
Can you bear this in mind?

295
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,470
That you are the editor of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

296
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,150
not Zhou Chuan's mother.

297
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,550
Chu Li,

298
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,750
it's not that I want to blame you.

299
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,830
Mr Liang is right.

300
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,470
I found that too.

301
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,630
Do you think

302
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,310
you're great

303
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,190
after being Zhou Chuan's editor?

304
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,630
Do you think everyone in the company

305
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,070
should make way for you?

306
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,070
Are others not allowed to

307
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,200
organize book fair except Zhou Chuan?

308
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,230
It's not about making way for me.

309
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,950
I only wish that Mr Zhou Chuan's book

310
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,270
could achieve a better sales.

311
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,750
Book fair is not some sort of

312
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,470
annual clearance sale.

313
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,190
And it's not Comic-Con where
the cosplayers can walk around.

314
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,590
Of course, I have
personal considerations.

315
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,630
I, too, wish that

316
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,070
tomorrow is my Mr Zhou Chuan's

317
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,460
special session.

318
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,150
Listen to her,

319
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,030
Mr Xia!

320
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,670
Why is Zhou Chuan yours?

321
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,990
I have to remind you.

322
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,830
As an editor,

323
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,780
the privatization of the author

324
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,070
is prohibited.

325
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,270
I think

326
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,430
what Cocoon told me

327
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,110
was not coined for nothing.

328
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,110
Deputy Editor Miao, watch your words!

329
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,470
All right.

330
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,790
Miao,

331
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,000
deal only with the current matter,
no name-calling.

332
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,350
So, everyone is here.

333
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,510
Mr Xia, it's been a long time.

334
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,270
Look at you,

335
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,900
you're full of energy.

336
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,990
You were in middle school

337
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,390
since I last saw you.

338
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,270
Yes.

339
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,030
In a blink of an eye,

340
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,380
I publish your book now.

341
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,470
No, no, no.

342
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,590
The Tang poetry that
you gave me that time

343
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,950
is kept on the bookshelf of my house.

344
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,980
Really?

345
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,050
Why did you drop by unexpectedly?

346
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,830
You're asking me?

347
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,830
Didn't I call you just now?

348
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,150
You said you're on meeting.

349
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,590
And you'll reply me later.

350
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,430
I rushed here

351
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,030
as I was impatient.

352
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,510
Mr Xia.

353
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,430
I've read the readers' comments
on Weibo today, saying that

354
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,470
the exhibition of Yuan Yue
Publishing House today is very popular.

355
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,990
It's said it was having a cosplayer.

356
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,390
Two more cosplayers
are coming tomorrow.

357
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,990
I'm here to verify it.

358
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,430
Tomorrow is the day of

359
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,350
Book of Luo He God's launch day, right?

360
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,910
Yes.

361
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,630
Of course it is.

362
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,870
Mr Zhou Chuan,

363
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,910
the launch of Book of Luo He God

364
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,510
is definitely the main point
of this book fair.

365
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,590
Rest assured.

366
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,830
I'll open a passageway
for VVIP.

367
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,090
It won't affect your new book's release.

368
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,510
Actually, I

369
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,590
am reluctant to share

370
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,450
an event venue with other people.

371
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,220
Xin Dun Books has invited
Maurer over tomorrow.

372
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,630
I have enough problems.

373
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,150
If something comes up again,

374
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,750
I think our future collaboration
will be over.

375
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,750
I was reckless.

376
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,660
Miao,

377
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,300
what's your opinion?

378
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,270
I...

379
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,470
The is the thing.

380
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,790
Mr Zhou Chuan.

381
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,590
We've already made
an official announcement that

382
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,990
this book selling and photograph events

383
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,030
will be held three days.

384
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,590
If we suddenly cancel it,

385
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,310
I think it'll cause dissatisfaction

386
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,580
among those readers

387
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,780
who have bought the admission tickets.

388
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,589
They've spent money.

389
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,180
If they make a scene

390
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,589
in the book fair,

391
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,650
I'm afraid it'll affect the launch
of Book of Luo He God.

392
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,950
This is all for peace.

393
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,470
How about this?

394
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,750
We just compress

395
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,230
the book selling and photograph events

396
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,510
to tomorrow morning from ten to twelve.

397
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,950
From twelve onward

398
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,030
until six in the evening,

399
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,510
this period of time

400
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,990
will be given to

401
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,340
the launch of the Book of Luo He God.

402
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,910
Isn't that good?

403
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,790
That is good!

404
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,950
That's the deal! Okay!

405
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,030
Little Zhou, just tell us if you

406
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,940
don't like it.

407
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,870
We respect your decision.

408
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,070
And

409
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,830
Mr Zhou Chuan,

410
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,070
I've asked two cosplayers

411
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,060
to play the male leading roles
of the Book of Luo He God.

412
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,030
What do you think?

413
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,670
Great!

414
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,510
Fantastic!

415
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,310
This will build momentum
for the Book of Luo He God.

416
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,150
Then can you guarantee

417
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,950
that it won't affect

418
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,590
the readers to purchase
the book tomorrow afternoon?

419
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,820
I can guarantee.

420
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,670
I'll send the personnel
to maintain the order.

421
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,550
And

422
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,610
everything will be under my control.

423
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,710
Okay.

424
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,980
Tomorrow,

425
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,580
I'll personally go on-site
and have a look too.

426
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,030
Mr Xia,

427
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,830
that's all.

428
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,790
Okay.

429
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,950
So, you must

430
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,070
strictly control the time
of the events tomorrow.

431
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,830
You must keep them well-organized.

432
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,260
Chu Li,

433
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,450
prepare a staff identity card
for Mr Zhou Chuan.

434
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,190
Rest assured, Mr Xia.

435
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,150
Mr Zhou Chuan is such a reasonable man.

436
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,070
A gentleman, Mr Chuan.
He has lived up to his reputation.

437
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,990
Miao,

438
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,470
what do you think?

439
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,310
He's as good as they say!

440
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,070
Just tell me what's on your mind.

441
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,200
Aren't you tired of looking sideways?

442
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,430
Mr Zhou Chuan,

443
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,590
why are you starting to monitor
the editorial department?

444
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,670
I can tell that
you were going to start a fight

445
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,630
in the editorial department
by your look when you went out.

446
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm a defensive person.

447
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
I can't watch my people get bullied.

448
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,430
Then why did you easily agree

449
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,630
with Miao's suggestion?

450
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,030
You compromised too soon.

451
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,070
It's not really your style.

452
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,830
I don't wish that the readers

453
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,990
get affected by the
role-playing activity.

454
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,750
I wish they could buy the book

455
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,430
and read it with a good mood.

456
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,990
Just like that.

457
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,990
You genuinely thought about your fans

458
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,630
unlike the seniors, they don't want
to offend either side.

459
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,150
They can't choose which one to abandon.

460
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,190
They don't want to lose you,

461
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,390
they don't want to lose
the stack clearance too.

462
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,190
They can only ask the circulation
department and the editorial department

463
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,320
to discuss the issue among ourselves.

464
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,510
Are you finished?

465
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,600
Then it's my turn to ask you.

466
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,130
When did Zhou Chuan become yours?

467
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,750
How long had you been eavesdropping?

468
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,020
When Miao started to

469
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,750
interrogate you.

470
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,750
Your...

471

Your readers

472
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,310
always say "my Mr Zhou Chuan" too.

473
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,270
As your editor and reader,

474
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,670
what's wrong about
me saying "my Mr Zhou Chuan" ?

475
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,070
Nothing's wrong.

476
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,030
I feel good to hear that.

477
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,630
Then why did you change your mind?

478
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,910
Rest assured.

479
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,590
Just do your job and sell the books.

480
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,670
Nothing will happen with me around.

481

the book fair when you awake.

I'm not awake,

489
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,390

You weren't like this

494
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,990
last night when you ensured

495
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,500
justice for the readers.

It's not that long,
more than three hours?

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,220
Come quickly.

562
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,390
Okay, I know.

563
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,350
You haven't seen it, right?
You need to study harder.

564
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,070
Mr Zhou Chuan is stuck in traffic.

565
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,870
He might be fifty minutes late.

566
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,310
Fifty minutes more?

567
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,590
But

568
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,590
there's no connection between

569
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,390
the end time of the book selling
and photograph events

570
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,550
and Mr Zhou Chuan's arrival time.

571
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,790
Right, I didn't say so.

572
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,750
Are you hungry?

573
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,860
I am.

574
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,870
Let's go eat.

575
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,990
Let's go. Let's go and eat.

576
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,190
Do you want to join us?

577
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,150
Chief Editor Yu,

578
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,390
why do I have a bad feeling?

579
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,760
[Reading makes the life better.]

580
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,870
Really?

581
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,660
The animation photograph is ongoing?

582
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,750
Shouldn't they hold the limited
launch for Zhou Chuan?

583
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,430
Right, the book selling
and photograph event

584
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,190
should be ended at noon.

585
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,910
But there's a steady stream

586
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,630
of anime fans now.

587
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,590
What's wrong with Yuan Yue
Publishing House? Look at the time.

588
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,780
Liang Chong Lang,

589
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,670
he went mad to boost their sales.

590
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,670
We haven't purchased it!

591
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,390
Right!

592
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,270
There're many people in the Comic-Con!
Look at the time!

593
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,060
Start it quickly!

594
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,310
Hurry up! We have things to do too!

595
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,310
When is he coming? When?

596
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,390
We have limited time!

597
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,630
We've waited for so long, hurry up!

598
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,670
Geez!

599
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,150
Chief Editor Yu,

600
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,420
what's going on?

601
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,790
It's already twenty past twelve.

602
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,110
Why are they still allowing

603
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,380
the people to enter?

604
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,040
When can they clear the place?

605
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,470
Chief Editor Yu,

606
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,790
the lunch is ready.
Why don't we just eat first?

607
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,750
Who has the mood to eat now?

608
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,390
The members of circulation department
are enjoying their lunch.

609
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,550
Where are they?

610
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,270
Over there.

611
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,300
Ah Xiang, you stay here as lookout.

612
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,510
Let's go there.

613
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,390
Look, look, look.

614
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,550
We're old.

615
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,390
I see you two enjoying your meal.

616
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,110
You want some?

617
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,990
Mr Liang,

618
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,700
I've told you once.

619
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,110
I'm not saying it again.

620
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,150
You had agreed to

621
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,590
end the events before twelve.

622
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,510
Look at the time now.

623
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,300
Why haven't you controlled the stream?

624
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,030
Zhou Chuan hasn't reached too.

625
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,550
Isn't he stuck in the traffic?

626
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,350
Just one more hour,
Director Yang already agreed.

627
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,510
Chief Editor Yu,

628
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,270
we didn't expect

629
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,870
the role-playing enthusiasts

630
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,390
would be this much.

631
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,070
Right.

632
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,310
And there are many people

633
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,870
coming from distant places.

634
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,470
They are here to support us.

635
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,830
We can't disappoint them

636
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,910
and ask them leave just like this.

637
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,790
Right.

638
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,030
Then have you thought about this?

639
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,700
What if Zhou Chuan's
fans couldn't enter

640
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,960
and purchase the book?

641
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,100
But I didn't see

642
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,510
any of them making a fuss

643
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,670
but you.

644
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,060
What's the big deal?

645
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,990
Why are you making this difficult?

646
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,390
So, you act like nothing happened

647
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,270
because they didn't
make a fuss in front of you?

648
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,710
Why did you break your promise
and extend the time?

649
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,710
Or do you think Zhou Chuan's readers

650
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,110
will come to buy
the books no matter what

651
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,030
since they've bought
the admission tickets?

652
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,390
So, it doesn't matter to
keep them waiting,

653
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,630
right?

654
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,220
Do you show respect to the author

655
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,150
and the readers?

656
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,950
Then do you show respect to the leader

657
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,390
and the superior?

658
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,990
Who is he?

659
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,150
He is your superior

660
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,140
not your grandson.

661
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,310
What makes you think

662
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,470
you can teach him?

663
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,800
Who do you think you are?

664
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,670
Respect the author?

665
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,350
Respect the readers?

666
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,590
That's so kind of you.

667
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,950
Don't be an editor,

668
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,310
go start a charity!

669
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,590
You just implement
the leader's decision,

670
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,650
you have no right to
tell us what to do!

671
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,470
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

672
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,310
You've reached?

673
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,270
Okay, I'll come pick you up.

674
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,820
Didn't you say he
needs fifty minutes more?

675
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,580
But he got here early.

676
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,190
There's nothing I can do.

677
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,340
Chief Editor, I'm going to pick him up.

678
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,220
Okay.

679
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,150
Then I'll stop eating.

680
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,350
I'll go and manage the situation first.

681
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,990
[What's wrong with
Yuan Yue Publishing House?]

682
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,600
[Isn't Book of Luo He God
start at twelve o'clock?]

683
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,120
[Why are they still letting
the COSER enthusiasts in?]

684
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,990
My Weibo is going to explode.

685
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,230
What's the situation up there?

686
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,710
The circulation department
finally started

687
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,230
to manage the situation
as they heard you've reached.

688
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,270
Let's go quickly.

689
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,070
Let's go.

690
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,990
Hello.

691
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,030
[It's me, Mr Liang.]

692
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,630
Chu Li, listen to me.

693
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,350
You do whatever it takes to

694
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,310
hold Zhou Chuan off.

695
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,230
[At least ten minutes.]

696
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,430
[Do you understand?]

697
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,430
Mr Liang,

698
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,350
Mr Zhou Chuan has entered the venue.

699
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,350
[He has entered?]

700
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,630
This is not right.

701
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,510
Young lady,

702
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,390
why is it so quiet

703
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,110
if you've entered the venue?

704
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,870
[Is this some kind of a trick?]

705
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,510
[Let me warn you.]

706
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,790
Are you trying to get back at me?

707
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,870
I tell you.

708
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,350
If you don't hold Zhou Chuan off,

709
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,610
[you don't have to come back to
Yuan Yue Publishing House.]

710
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,380
You...

711
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,670
I am Zhou Chuan.

712
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,470
What's wrong with
Yuan Yue Publishing House?

713
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,710
[You're still letting the
role-playing enthusiasts in now.]

714
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,310
Isn't the event
supposed to end at twelve?

715
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,150
Who are they trying to take photo with?

716
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,140
Is it me?

717
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,830
Mr Zhou Chuan, calm down.

718
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,630
Listen to me.

719
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,160
[How can I not be agitated?]

720
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,110
There are many comments on my Weibo.

721
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,670
They are all my fans' complaints.

722
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,710
Others' fans are more

723
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,310
important than mine, right?

724
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,870
What's the matter
with the circulation department?

725
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,590
[Just quit if you don't
want to sell the books.]

726
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,660
Just hold a clearance sale

727
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,540
in the farmers' market,

728
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,950
such as ten dollars for three catties.

729
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,620
I'm sure it's more lively than now.

730
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,750
Mr Zhou Chuan, okay, I admit

731
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,190
that the current situation

732
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,070
makes you mad.

733
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,590
[But you can rest assured.]

734
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,070
[Everything]

735
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,110
can...

736
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,870
Hello.

737
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,750
I came out at ten thirty.

738
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,710
How would I know
there'll be a traffic jam?

739
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,860
I haven't had my breakfast too.

740
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,470
What are you trying to say?

741
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,790
I didn't mean to be late.

742
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,320
I didn't know
there'll be a traffic accident.

743
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,150
I've tried to reach here as fast as I can.

744
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,670
Why are you telling me this?

745
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,590
I...

746
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,790
I'm afraid you'll start a fight
with the circulation department.

747
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,700
You might be

748
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,020
a dead meat when I reach

749
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,070
and come back to haunt me, asking me

750
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,350
why I didn't protect you.

751
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,670
The book fair is crowded.

752
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,820
I know you hate to go
to the crowded place.

753
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,830
So, I'm touched that you came.

754
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,230
My fans say

755
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,340
they wouldn't buy a book

756
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,140
from Yuan Yue Publishing House
if it wasn't for me.

757
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,830
Do you regret?

758
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,270
About what?

759
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,670
About choosing
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

760
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,630
There are tiresome
circulation departments,

761
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,870
illustrators who are hard to communicate,

762
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,110
and infuriating authors everywhere.

763
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,590
So, I regret nothing.

764
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,990
Let's go.

765
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,190
Let's go.

766
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,270
Excuse me! Excuse me!

767
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,630
That should be Maurer.

768
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,670
His book signing is going to
start at three o'clock.

769
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

770
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,470
don't tell me you are starstruck.

771
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,390
Of course not.

772
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,320
I can have dinner with him tonight.

773
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,110
Luckily, you didn't lose your mind.

774
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,470
They sweep it all real quick.

775
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,000
It's only been five minutes

776
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,150
and they are done?

777
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,390
I guess the circulation department
went all out.

778
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,670
Mr Zhou Chuan!

779
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,670
Mr Zhou Chuan!

780
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,790
You're here.

781
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,580
Mr Liang

782
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,220
is waiting for you at the rest room.

783
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,070
Miao,

784
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,950
I'll mistake you as the member of

785
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,410
the circulation department
if I didn't know you're an editor.

786
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,950
We are all

787
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,790
from Yuan Yue Publishing House

788
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,670
and also the leaders
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

789
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,420
There's no discrimination.

790
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,950
Old workers like us

791
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,830
are no match to the youngsters.

792
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,030
They have short temper.

793
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,230
We are just doing our jobs.

794
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,990
We'll just do

795
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,390
as the leaders told us to

796
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,510
no matter what position we hold.

797
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,980
Okay. Then,

798
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,470
I'll stop bothering you.

799
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,550
Chu Li, take me there.

800
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,630
This way, please.

801
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,550
Director Gu, are you all right?

802
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,310
You haven't rested these few days

803
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,070
to arrange

804
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,870
this event for Maurer.

805
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,510
And you've been standing for so long.

806
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,840
Why don't you go and
rest in the small room?

807
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,110
I'm fine. It's going to end soon.

808
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,710
I have to keep an eye on the event.

809
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,590
Thank you.

810
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,520
You're welcome.

811
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,870
Mr Zhou Chuan,

812
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,900
you've finally reached.

813
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,470
You must be tired. Have a seat.

814
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,230
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Let's eat first.

815
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,180
I'm not tired.

816
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,390
It's no match to
the circulation department.

817
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,310
That's our job.

818
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,310
Here. Eat it.

819
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,790
Drink some water.

820
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,710
Chu Li,

821
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,230
it's quite busy out there.

822
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,910
Go and help them.

823
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,270
Have you not eaten yet?

824
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,790
Here, eat it first.

825
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,310
Never mind, you eat it.

826
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,510
I'll go and help them.

827
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,740
Chu Li,

828
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,580
Mr Zhou Chuan has said it.

829
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,670
He shows you consideration.

830
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,340
Just eat it.

831
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,150
Here.

832
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,270
Sit here.

833
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,910
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

834
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,220
Mr Zhou Chuan, come sit here.

835
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,710
Here, sit.

836
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,630
You must be tired.

837
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,360
Everyone understands
you were stuck in traffic.

838
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,550
Look.

839
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,190
I'm sorry.

840
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,190
You saw the strong reaction

841
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,850
of the role-playing enthusiasts
out there too.

842
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,230
I had no choice

843
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,430
but to extend an hour

844
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,870
for them

845
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,670
to calm them down.

846
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,510
You don't mind that, right?

847
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,770
I can understand that.

848
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,989
The role-playing has high popularity.

849
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,989
Masked men like us are

850
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,110
no match to them.

851
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,790
You can't sell yourself short.

852
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,190
You are young

853
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,949
but I think you have

854
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,350
the highest popularity

855
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,510
in this venue.

856
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,070
Right, Chu Li?

857
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:33,350
Xin Dun Books has invited Maurer over.

858
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,070
He seems famous

859
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,070
but I think that's about it.

860
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,179
You will pass him

861
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,440
in less than two years.

862
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,670
Right, we...

863
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,190
Have we added WeChat yet?

864
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,790
Let's add WeChat.

865
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,230
It'll be more convenient
for our future collaboration.

866
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,870
Here.

867
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,870
All right.

868
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,220
Scan me.

869
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,710
Mr Zhou Chuan, I've read your book.

870
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,550
I believe it will achieve

871
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,950
the highest sales.

872
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,870
Our circulation department already
has a comprehensive plan.

873
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,710
Mr Liang,

874
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,830
didn't you just say

875
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,430
it's understaffed out there?

876
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,140
Right, I wonder

877
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,030
how they're doing

878
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,150
without me around.

879
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,830
I have to go check on them.

880
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,310
Look.

881
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,470
Enjoy your meal.

882
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,550
I've

883
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,750
sent it.

884
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,820
Please accept my request.

885
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

886
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,710
may I ask you

887
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,570
about your mental journey
of being added on WeChat?

888
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,670
He'll get my WeChat contact

889
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,790
from Miao even if I didn't add him.

890
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,470
So,

891
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,910
what's the difference?

892
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,230
Can't I add him?

893
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,030
You can't.

894
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,950
Didn't I tell you?

895
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,220
Author is the weapon of an editor.

896
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,590
Didn't you agree with me?

897
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,310
Yes.

898
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,270
But now my weapon

899
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,030
goes in the enemy's sheath.

900
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,670
Rest assured, I won't betray you.

901
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,550
Look.

902
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,710
I didn't add him.

903
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,670
It's true.

904
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,350
But

905
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,580
aren't you afraid of offending him?

906
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,310
I tell you what.

907
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,150
People from the circulation department
are smooth talkers.

908
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,550
I'm afraid you'll be deceived.

909
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,910
Aren't you too hypocritical

910
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,910
to ask this question now?

911
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,670
Why would I be afraid
of offending them?

912
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,870
Isn't he the one

913
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,230
who made this...

914
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,310
Green Onion Flavour Snack Immortal?

915
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,030
It's too soft-hearted to create

916
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,510
such screen name for

917
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,430
a middle-aged man like him.

918
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,180
Is this Mr Liang's WeChat name?

919
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,510
It's so disgusting!

920
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,750
Eat it.

921
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,150
I don't want to eat. I'll go to work.

922
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,110
This looks awful.

923
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,910
You...

924
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,790
Suit yourself.

925
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,190
You're late.

926
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,700
Mr Maurer went back to the hotel.

927
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,310
I'm not Zhou Chuan.

928
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,470
I'm not that obsessed with Maurer.

929
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,310
So, you're here to

930
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,370
check out your brother's situation.

931
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,790
There are still

932
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,430
many of his fans at this hour.

933
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,750
Should I talk with them too?

934
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,080
In case I get a chance
to publish his books.

935
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,810
He won't sign it over to Xin Dun Books.

936
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,910
Life is full of uncertainties.

937
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,950
The venue is going to close soon.

938
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,310
Please make a rapid departure.

939
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,190
Stop queuing up!

940
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,910
Stop queuing up!

941
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,390
I've been queuing
for more than two hours.

942
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,790
The readers came all the way here.

943
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,710
They can't buy the book
after queuing up for a whole day.

944
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,240
Now that they ask them
to leave just like this.

945
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,470
Mister,

946
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,110
can you make an exception?

947
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,630
Just a few people left,

948
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,470
they'll leave after buying the book.

949
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,950
They've been queuing for so long.

950
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,510
I'm sorry.

951
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,990
Please cooperate with us too.

952
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,910
Fans and the staffs, clear out quick.

953
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,430
It would be a trouble if someone

954
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,590
got locked in the venue.

955
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,470
Dismiss! Dismiss!

956
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,110
Let's go! Let's go!

957
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,570
Yuan Yue Publishing House

958
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,090
is so unprofessional.

959
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,870
Jiang Yu Cheng,

960
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,310
here's a cautionary tale.

961
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,370
Do you want to consider Xin Dun Books?

962
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,830
I'm really sorry.

963
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,110
Today's event has ended.

964
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,750
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

965
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,950
We didn't get the autograph

966
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,830
and didn't buy the book.

967
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,510
Zhou Chuan is not
going to come tomorrow.

968
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,270
Sister, can you buy it for me first?

969
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,430
I'm going to study abroad and
my flight is on tomorrow morning.

970
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,750
I can't come even I want to.

971
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,270
Dismiss!

972
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,670
Stop checking out, please cooperate.

973
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,340
Leave.

974
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,470
I'm sorry.

975
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,310
I'm really sorry. Sorry.

976
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,990
Are you hurt?

977
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,950
Stop rubbing it.

978
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,900
Thank you.

979
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,620
You still wear high heels
to the book fair

980
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,350
where you need to stand all day?

981
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,750
Didn't I say I have

982
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,810
something to tell you after I return?

983
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,110
Can we start over?

984
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,990
I've already written

985
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,550
what I want to tell you on the card.

986
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,860
Then can we start a new journey?

987
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,310
Why bother to try again if the ending

988
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,190
is still the same?

989
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,030
Go buy her a pair of shoes.

990
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,030
Flat shoes.

991
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,270
Do you still care about her?

992
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,630
You still care about her, right?

993
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,590
Don't wear this.

994
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,580
I'll buy you a pair of flat shoes.

995
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,710
Yun Fei,

996
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,910
I'm sorry.

997
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,550
I'm being too selfish.

998
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,270
I didn't care

999
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,990
about your feelings.

1000
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,550
It's all right, sister.

1001
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,670
I won't do

1002
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,400
anything childish from now on.

1003
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,870
I've figured it out in these days.

1004
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,780
I'll court you when I

1005
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,510
become a grown man

1006
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,350
and have the capability.

1007
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,910
Where's your ending script?

1008
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,110
When are you going to send it to me?

1009
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,340
Stop making me rush you.

1010
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,630
This is the first step to grow.

1011
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,180
Why do you rush me
as soon as you see me?

1012
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,350
Sister, I've been
avoiding you for days.

1013
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,670
You keep circling back
to the same topic.

1014
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,150
Okay, I'll stop talking.

1015
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,110
Go and buy the shoes.

1016
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,040
I need to attend the banquet later.

1017
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,230
Okay, I'll go now.

1018
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,070
Wait for me.

1019
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,750
Wait for me.

1020
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,510
Miao,

1021
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,910
have you seen this sales before?

1022
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,430
It takes only half a day.

1023
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,510
Didn't he break the record?

1024
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,030
Yes.

1025
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,420
Zhou Chuan is amazing.

1026
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,310
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1027
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,380
you're here.

1028
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,230
Youth are to be regarded with respect.

1029
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,310
What did I tell you?

1030
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,190
Why wait 2 years?

1031
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,830
You'll pass Maurer tomorrow.

1032
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,350
Right,

1033
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,110
just from...

1034
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,070
Judging from this situation alone,

1035
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,550
you're much better than
Maurer's personal book tour.

1036
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,630
Yes.

1037
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,150
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1038
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,430
I'm really sorry about today.

1039
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,590
It's our problem.

1040
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,470
I think Yuan Yue Publishing House

1041
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,630
should apologize to

1042
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,630
the readers for today's matter

1043
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,890
and we have to give them
the corresponding compensations.

1044
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:11,860
Of course.

1045
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,870
Miao, let's call a meeting
right away when we're back.

1046
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,790
Notify everyone of the meeting.

1047
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,630
To summarize the gains
and losses of today's work.

1048
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,670
Noted.

1049
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,750
As for the readers,

1050
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,150
we have to give them an explanation.

1051
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,880
Yes, we need to explain to them.

1052
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,670
Mr Zhou Chuan,
the books sold well today.

1053
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,590
I'll treat you, let's go.

1054
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,650
Let's have supper.

1055
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,870
Zhou Chuan, you finally came out.

1056
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,590
We'll take your car.

1057
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1058
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,550
can I please talk to you for a second?

1059
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,310
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1060
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,510
just tell me if you have any decision.

1061
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,190
It's all right. I can take it.

1062
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,950
It would be hard to
explain to the readers

1063
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,350
if I sign Huang Quan Inn over
to Yuan Yue Publishing House

1064
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,270
after what had happened.

1065
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,350
You mean Huang Quan Inn is now

1066
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,870
owned by Xin Dun Books,

1067
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,190
right?
