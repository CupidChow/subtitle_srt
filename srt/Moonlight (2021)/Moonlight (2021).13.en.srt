5
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,710
I sent a "yes"?

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,830
[The message above is unfinished.]

7
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,630

So,

16
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,870
she rejected Jiang Yu Cheng, right?

17
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,910
It won't do.

18
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,670
I'll try it again.

19
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,310
Hello.

20
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,070
Right,

21
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,550
my work is a trash and it's not
qualified for the selection.

22
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,550
Only the work of an old author like you

23
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,540
is qualified.

24
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,870
But

25
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,060
which book of yours is awarded

26
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,110
after winning Hong Ying Award?

27
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,510
I guess the old author like you

28
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,310
has been drained,

29
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,350
that's why they want

30
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,630
the young authors
like us to be the fillers.

31
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,110
Forget it.

32
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,030
I never thought

33
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,630
you were my father.

34
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,590
I won't be surprised

35
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,310
if you tell me

36
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,150
that I was adopted.

37
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,590
I wonder why

38
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,070
a person who never calls me

39
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,710
gave me a call all of a sudden.

40
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,070
So, it was Mr Xia told you that.

41
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,390
Are you afraid that
I'll embarrass the Zhou family

42
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,190
if my work is sent to
the selection of Huazhi Award?

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,420
Oh my god, Mr Zhou senior!

44
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,829
You're getting me

45
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,910
in trouble.

46
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,910
All right.

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,230
I know what to do then.

48
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,030
Gentleman, this is a toast to you.

49
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,550
Are you sleep walking?

50
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,670
I will only dare to flatter my mother

51
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,900
and secretly complain about her.

52
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,710
I really respect the one who dares to

53
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,430
fight face-to-face like you.

54
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,830
You should be ashamed

55
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,230
of eavesdropping.

56
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,870
Mr Zhou Chuan.

57
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,350
Don't waste your chance

58
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,350
because of your father.

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,350
I think you worry that
I might hold up on you.

60
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,310
Promise me to send your work to

61
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,269
Huazhi Award's selection for my sake.

62
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,830
Book of Luo He God
managed to sell well.

63
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,430
The honour and bonus

64
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,950
are all given
to the circulation department.

65
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,510
Miao and Liang Chong Lang

66
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,510
even grossed me out
with the figure 349,000.

67
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,470
I've been depressed

68
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,710
for a whole day by this matter.

69
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,140
As for Ah Xiang,

70
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,550
she has been editing the poster.

71
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,100
This deepens

72
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,420
her myopia.

73
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,790
And for Mr Xia,

74
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,350
he has a weak body,

75
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,350
but still insists to supervise
the progress of the project.

76
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,750
It breaks my heart
whenever I think about it.

77
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,550
Use your words.

78
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,550
Why are you crying?

79
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,990
I don't know why.

80
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,830
But I always want to cry lately.

81
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,900
Stop crying.

82
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,470
Probably because I think it's unfair.

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,550
Why does all the credit
go to the circulation department?

84
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,590
But there's nothing

85
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,230
for our editorial department.

86
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,350
I've seen your effort.

87
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,190
Just that I didn't get
a chance to say thank you.

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,310
I'm glad that

89
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,750
I'd signed Book of Luo He God
over to you.

90
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,990
Thank you.

91
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,350
Mr Zhou Chuan,

92
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,580
so you've seen my effort.

93
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,510
All right, don't cry.

94
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,830
Why do you cry over anything?

95
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,270
Aren't you usually

96
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,790
a domineering person?

97
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,150
Why are you crying so much recently?

98
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,590
Can I ask you a question?

99
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,270
Go ahead.

100
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,150
Can you send Book of Luo He God

101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,190
to Huazhi Award's selection?

102
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,590
Okay.

103
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,390
I'll do as you wish.

104
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,630
I think you deserve

105
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,470
the most credit anyway.

106
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,470
I'll let you call the shots.

107
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,670
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

108
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,470
Don't mention it. Don't cry.

109
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,870
Cheers!

110
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,710
We didn't get a chance to celebrate

111
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,390
the great sale of
Book of Luo He God.

112
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,710
Congratulations on
becoming the top author!

113
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,430
Slow down!

114
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,830
Why are you more excited than me?

115
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,230
Because I'm happy.

116
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,620
Since your bonus is gone,

117
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,990
then just stay in my house.

118
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,190
Do you have only one bedding set?

119
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,720
Go and acquire one more set.

120
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,980
Are you going to pay for it?

121
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,430
You've just cried in my arms

122
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,830
this afternoon.

123
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,750
And now

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,610
you started to swindle me, right?

125
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,990
Of course.

126
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,030
Money is the most important thing.

127
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,870
The royalty on
Book of Luo He God that I got

128
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,150
is enough for you to
buy ten mattresses.

129
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,190
No, besides the mattress,

130
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,950
there's a lot of stuff I want to buy.

131
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,030
For example, my new clothes,

132
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,380
new pillow,

133
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,510
and also a beanbag.

134
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,070
Then I just buy you a new house.

135
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,180
All right, stop drinking.

136
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,990
You're not allowed to

137
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,110
go out drinking as
you're a bad drinker.

138
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,230
I refuse.

139
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,510
You're not my boyfriend.

140
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,550
Why are you telling me what to do?

141
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,190
I tell you what. I'm a good drinker.

142
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,670
Give it back to me!

143
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,870
Give it back to me! Give it back to me!

144
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,430
♫ I want to hide like a kid
who made mistakes ♫

145
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,780
♫ My heart skipped a beat ♫

146
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,650
♫ When you look at me

♫ You don't seem to be surprised ♫

153
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,490
♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

154
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,230
♫ I have told you a thousand times ♫

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,560

♫ I have got a million whys ♫

162

How is it? Did you
sleep well last night?

163
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,910
Last night?

164
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,110
Nothing happened last night, right?

165
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,470
Probably...

166
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,430
Nothing happened, right?

167
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,270
Rest assured.

168
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,130
I'll take the responsibility

169
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,790
no matter what happened.

170
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,950
Then... I shall go to work first.

171
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh my god!

172
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,750
What should I do?

173
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,190
Did something really happen?

174
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,430
He wants to be responsible for me?

175
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,550
What is that about?

176
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,870
What am I going
to explain to my father?

177
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,700
Chu Li, what's the matter?

178
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,190
You look awful.

179
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,550
Last night...

180
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,870
What happened last night?

181
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,260
Last night,

182
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,710
there's a friend of mine
and she was drunk.

183
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,710
Then?

184
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,350
Then an indescribable matter seemed to

185
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,750
have happened between her and a man.

186
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,270
Then?

187
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,990
Then I...

188
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,700
My friend doesn't know what to do.

189
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,780
Then does your friend

190
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,310
like the guy?

191
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,550
She seems

192
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,230
kind of

193
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,540
like that guy.

194
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,350
Just ask your friend

195
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,790
to try dating the guy.

196
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,070
It's not right.

197
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,030
That guy's best friend is pursuing her.

198
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,590
It's confusing.

199
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,070
Then who exactly

200
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,110
does your friend like?

201
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,190
Of course she likes...

202
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,910
Why didn't you answer
Mr Zhou Chuan's call?

203
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,670
Did she just hang up on me?

204
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,870
[When are you coming back?]

205
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,310
[I want to have hotpot tonight.]

206
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,550
[Zhou Chuan]

207
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,070
Hello.

208
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,430
The books are here?

209
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,790
All right, I'm coming.

210
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,270
Meeting in the conference room.

211
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,510
Let's go to the meeting.

212
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,490
Hurry up! Let's go to the meeting.

213
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,650
It doesn't feel right.

214
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,910
Who's her friend?

215
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,550
Isn't that me?

216
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,870
Yuan Yue's annual
Interactive Cultural Festival

217
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,270
between authors and readers
is coming soon.

218
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,790
Story relay event is held every year

219
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,670
to increase the interaction between

220
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,950
the journal and
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

221
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,470
Contact each author you handle.

222
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,430
Understood.

223
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,220
Chu Li,

224
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,350
have you heard me?

225
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,910
Yes, I heard you.

226
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,790
That's perfect. I have something to add.

227
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,710
What did she say?

228
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,110
Mr Liang suggests that

229
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,470
we can examine

230
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,230
the popularity of our authors

231
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,150
with this Interactive Culture Festival.

232
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,110
For those who have less popularity,

233
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,430
we will

234
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,540
cancel their serial stories

235
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,790
in Moonlight Magazine.

236
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,590
Do you mean

237
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,630
terminating the contract
with those authors?

238
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,190
Right, it's the survival
of the fittest.

239
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,750
It's very normal.

240
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,870
I think Mr Liang's suggestion

241
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,470
is reasonable.

242
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,990
I agree.

243
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,270
Did Director Yang agree with it?

244
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,580
Director Yang said

245
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,750
Yuan Yue is not a charitable institution.

246
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,910
In this Interactive Culture Festival,

247
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,070
please be sure to do
your best for each author

248
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,670
so that they could
perform at their best.

249
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,400
In this way, the editorial department
can have a clear conscience.

250
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,590
Chu Li, you have Zhou Chuan

251
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,790
and Jiang Yu Cheng these two geniuses.

252
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,470
What are you worried about?

253
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,990
I'm not worried about that.

254
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,430
They can't take advantage
of others like this.

255
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,580
They keep asking them to

256
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,150
write manuscripts without paying them.

257
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,630
How can they do that?

258
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,020
Listen to me.

259
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,550
You don't have to write 6,000 words.

260
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,430
Just 3,000 words are enough.

261
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,830
It's just the new pattern once a year.

262
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,320
Then I'll wait for
your starting article.

263
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,580
It's a deal, goodbye.

264
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,310
I forgot to tell Suo Heng

265
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,580
that she doesn't have
to write many versions.

266
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,630
I can't read that much.

267
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,430
Miao doesn't worry about
how the writing's going.

268
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,900
He doesn't care

269
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,030
if those unpopular authors get fired.

270
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,560
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour: When are you
coming back? I want to have hotpot tonight.]

271
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,590
[When are you coming back?]

272
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,390
[I want to have hotpot tonight.]

273
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,110
Why does he act

274
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,230
like nothing happened?

275
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,580
This is awkward.

276
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,870
This Stinky Monkey is indeed disloyal.

277
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,080
She already sneaked out to date

278
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,470
after only a few hours.

279
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,030
For this year's
Interactive Culture Festival,

280
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,980
my company asks every editor

281
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,390
to find our author to
create a story relay.

282
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,470
Mr Jiang, I'm begging you.

283
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,710
Okay, when do you need it?

284
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,030
Really?

285
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,070
Preferably within this week.

286
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,510
Mr Jiang, I'll never
forget your kindness.

287
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,070
I will never turn down your request.

288
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,790
But why didn't you ask Zhou Chuan?

289
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,310
Such activity without pay,

290
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,110
he will say that I'm insulting him

291
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,630
if I ask him to do it.

292
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,750
It's better for me not
to ask for trouble.

293
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,230
What is the activity?

294
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,710
But he'll know it

295
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,430
sooner or later.

296
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,070
And again he'll think that

297
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,910
you don't think much of him
if he finds out about this.

298
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,020
It's all right.

299
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,070
I already got used to it anyway.

300
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,349
You don't seem fine today.

301
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,630
Why are you avoiding whenever

302
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,030
we talk about Zhou Chuan?

303
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,220
Did something happen
between you two?

304
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,099
Am I? I'm not avoiding.

305
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,760
Nothing happened between us.

306
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,470
Are you sure?

307
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,710
Yes, I'm sure.

308
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,670
What can happen between us?

309
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,140
Nothing happened.

310
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,910
Mr Jiang,

311
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,839
I'll leave first as I got work to do.

312
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,750
Come out, she didn't say anything.

313
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,830
How did you know I was here?

314
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,790
Look at your size,

315
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,580
you're like a groundhog,
sneaking around.

316
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,310
Do you think I'm blind?

317
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,190
I think you are.

318
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,660
This is so-called
James Bond's hiding skills.

319
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,750
Do you know that?

320
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,960
A cup of coffee, please.

321
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,150
I think you're more
like James the groundhog.

322
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,580
I wonder

323
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,950
what happened between you and Chu Li.

324
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,950
Normally, you'd have rushed in

325
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,350
if you saw us talking.

326
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,110
But today you were hiding instead.

327
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,750
Who's hiding?

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,110
I was standing there

329
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,510
to rest for a while.

330
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,430
Did you two

331
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,830
have a fight?

332
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,230
That's great!

333
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,270
What do you mean great?
Where are the books?

334
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,070
Thank you.

335
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,990
What exactly is the story of

336
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,430
Huang Quan Inn you wrote?

337
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,990
Why do you need many
ancient architecture books?

338
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,590
What is the theme?

339
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,550
You'll know once it's serialized.

340
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,230
I'm going.

341
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,870
Keep your aggressiveness
away from Chu Li.

342
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:14,230
[Little Monkey]

343
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,990
[Mr Zhou, I'm going to
work overtime today.]

344
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,700
[You and Er Gou are
on your own for dinner.]

345
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,700
Mr Zhou,

346
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,630
why are you still up this late hour?

347
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,110
[What is he trying to do?]

348
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,030
You didn't answer my call or

349
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,360
reply to my WeChat message this whole day.

350
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,360
Are you purposely avoiding me?

351
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,510
I'm not.

352
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,820
I was just busy working.

353
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,900
Why didn't you

354
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,350
stay in the office then?

355
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,190
No place is more comfortable
than our own house.

356
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,630
Whose house are you saying?

357
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,750
My mistake.

358
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,910
I heard you're going to launch
an activity without any pay.

359
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,170
And you've asked
Jiang Yu Cheng for help.

360
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,510
Why didn't you ask me?

361
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,270
That is Interactive Culture Festival.

362
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,870
I'm thinking that we can

363
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,950
discuss about it
when I'm back home.

364
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,080
There's no need to discuss.

365
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,990
I agree.

366
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,690
Consider it as
the compensation for last night.

367
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,380
[This won't do, I must clarify it.]

368
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,350
Did I hug you

369
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,950
last night?

370
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,300
Or did I kiss you?

371
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,340
Don't tell me that...

372
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,670
You did nothing.

373
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,030
That's good.

374
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,750
I can pretend

375
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,190
that nothing had ever happened.

376
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,230
Then let's pretend
that nothing had happened.

377
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,750
I'm going to rest first.

378
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,790
Right.

379
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,630
You must help me in the activity.

380
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,270
Interesting.

381
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,190
Why are you looking at me?

382
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,310
I know.

383
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,260
I should've done

384
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,830
what I should last night.

385
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,220
Wasn't she drunk?

386
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,070
What can I do?

387
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,930
[Father]

388
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,070
Father,

389
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,550
I'm an unfilial child.

390
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,030
I've betrayed you.

391
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,790
It's not right.

392
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,710
What if I didn't do it?

393
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,750
Forget it.

394
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,010
Just pretend nothing had ever happened.

395
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,030
Right, nothing had happened.

396
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,880
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

397
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,110
Just pretend nothing had ever happened?

398
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,270
Then what exactly
had happened between them?

399
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,670
Did they hold hands?

400
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,150
Did they hug?

401
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,230
Did they kiss?

402
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,190
Don't tell me it was...

403
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,990
I've told you, nothing had happened!

404
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,670
Ah Xiang, Elephant,

405
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,990
stop asking me.

406
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,270
Chu Li,

407
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,990
I think your friend

408
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,820
is doing the right thing.

409
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,350
Perhaps that guy

410
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,710
doesn't really like your friend.

411
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,590
Ms Suo Heng.

412
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,230
Are you here for Miao?

413
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,750
Why don't you go up?

414
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,470
I...

415
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,830
Forget it, I'll come again next time.

416
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,060
Suo Heng.

417
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,670
Why did you come?

418
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,880
Deputy Editor Miao.

419
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,630
I've been thinking
about the start of

420
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,030
the Interactive Culture Festival
since you told me last time.

421
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,390
But all I can think

422
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,910
is only the historical themes.

423
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,580
But you said this kind of themes

424
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,150
is going to be outdated soon

425
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,190
so I'm very anxious.

426
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,990
I want to come and

427
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,430
ask your opinion.

428
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,870
Why did you come all the way here?

429
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,950
You just have to send me a message.

430
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,830
I think it's better to
communicate in person.

431
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,230
Because I don't really understand
what you're saying

432
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,790
on the phone or in the message.

433
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,150
I mean I have poor
understanding ability.

434
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,310
I need your guidance.

435
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,710
Look, why are you being humble?

436
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,510
Editors like us

437
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,580
should learn more from the authors.

438
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,550
Since you're here,

439
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,190
let's go upstairs and talk about it.

440
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,990
Meet you in the conference room.

441
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,830
Chu Li, get some water.

442
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,870
Follow me.

443
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,950
Here.

444
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,110
Suo Heng, here.

445
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,710
Have a seat.

446
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,780
Deputy Editor Miao,

447
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,950
tell me your suggestion.

448
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,300
All right.

449
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,070
You don't need to record it.

450
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,150
I'm here to get the ball rolling.

451
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,950
Just take it as a conversation,

452
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,470
a little chitchat.

453
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,520
Right, Suo Heng.

454
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,310
Have you watched Star Trek?

455
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,590
I've never watched it.

456
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,230
Suo Heng,

457
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,550
do you usually

458
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,110
have no hobbies?

459
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,870
My favourite hobby is writing.

460
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,190
Never mind.

461
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,340
No wonder

462
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,390
you can insist on writing for so long.

463
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,630
So, what my suggestion for you is

464
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,590
that I hope that you could

465
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,430
think out of the box.

466
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,670
To start with a science fiction theme.

467
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,310
You'll definitely come as a bombshell.

468
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,940
But I'm bad at writing
in science fiction.

469
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,700
It's not that hard, look.

470
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,790
You just have to watch a few movies.

471
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,510
And then read more
science fiction novels.

472
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,070
You had little contact with

473
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,230
humanities book too.

474
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,070
I think you're good at
writing in this genre now.

475
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,870
Actually, it was quite hard for me
to write in that genre.

476
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,100
I even forced myself to play games.

477
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,830
And I always got complaints
of being a bad player.

478
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,460
What if you write in the genre
that you're good at?

479
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,440
It's none of your business.

480
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,030
Are you in charge?

481
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,590
Or I just get out?

482
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,650
Deputy Editor Miao, have some water.

483
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,230
Look at her,
interrupting our conversation.

484
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,510
How rude.

485
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,110
I mean

486
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,070
you just have to write
2,000 to 3,000 words.

487
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,270
It's not like you have to
write 200,000 to 300,000 words,

488
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,310
right?

489
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,530
The deadline is on the day
after tomorrow. You can do it.

490
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,950
It's raining. Get the laundry.

491
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,310

-I'm sorry.

-Hurry up!
-Boss.

500
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,270
Do you have science fiction novel?

501
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,930
Yes, I do. I'll find it for you.

502
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,380
There are a few of them.

503
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,070
Science fiction

504
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,710
and...

505
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,790
[Clearance Sales]
[Golden Spears and Armoured Horses]

506
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,720
[Golden Spears and Armoured Horses]

507
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,990
[Golden Spears and Armoured Horses]

508
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,230
Golden Spears and Armoured Horses.

509
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,310
If you like histories,

510
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,550
this is a nice book.

511
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,630
This author is pretty cool.

512
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,630
This book is quite nice.

513
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,470
But the subsequent book is not
as good as the previous one.

514
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,350
The debut work got
the author to the peak.

515
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,410
But there's no news of the author now.

516
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,910
How is it? Do you like it?

517
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,950
I'm selling it for two dollars.

518
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,310
No, thank you.

519
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,910
Don't go.

520
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,430
I sell it for 50 cents.

521
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,270
There're many other books, pick some!

522
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,550
You're not going to work
overtime this weekend, right?

523
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,630
Let's go and buy two beanbags.

524
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:27,030
What's wrong? Who made you angry?

525
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,550
Don't start it.

526
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,790
Today, Miao asked one of his authors

527
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,990
to write in the genre
which she is bad at.

528
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,250
What does that have to do with you?

529
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,070
That author is Suo Heng.

530
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,990
I've read her Golden Spears
and Armoured Horses.

531
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,070
She is suitable in
writing historical novel.

532
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,300
Asking her to write science fiction,

533
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,060
isn't that ruining her career?

534
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,380
Then

535
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,910
did she agree?

536
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,470
It looked like she didn't reject him.

537
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,470
She asked for it.

538
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,350
If you have the time to feel aggrieved,

539
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,410
you might as well prepare the dinner.

540
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,470
Do you have compassion?

541
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,070
She chose to compromise.

542
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,230
Do I still have to show my compassion?

543
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,150
There're many authors
like her in this world.

544
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,630
You can find them everywhere.

545
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,140
Do you think every author could

546
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,670
write the stories they like?

547
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,780
To earn a living,

548
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,510
they will give up on
what they insisted.

549
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,030
For this kind of author,

550
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,430
I advise you to mind your own business.

551
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,390
Ms Suo Heng, is your hand all right?

552
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,070
I'm fine. It comes from years of writing.

553
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,790
Let me help you.

554
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,430
Thank you.

555
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,550
Wait a little longer,

556
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,310
Miao will be here soon.

557
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,350
I have to go.

558
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,610
Here, did you write it?
Let me take a look.

559
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,550
You're done for now. Get out.

560
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,980
Deputy Editor Miao,

561
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,230
I was cramming last night.

562
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,380
I watched dozens
science fiction movies.

563
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,990
And I wrote three
introductions in total.

564
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,270
I'm more confident

565
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,830
about the first one.

566
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,710
About the third introduction,

567
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,270
I personally think that

568
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,600
there's some problem on the setting,
it's not clear enough.

569
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,730
In these few introductions of yours,

570
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,030
I think

571
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,270
the third one is the best.

572
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,670
The third one?

573
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,110
The third one.

574
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,700
This one, look.

575
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,870
In these three introductions of yours,

576
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,100
as for the first one,

577
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,590
it is a historical plot
which is cloaked in science fiction.

578
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,430
You're skilled at writing

579
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,630
in historical theme, it is common.

580
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,190
The readers are used to it.

581
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,230
As for the second one,
it's just a historical theme.

582
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,750
This is already outdated.

583
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,590
The young readers

584
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,230
are not interested in this.

585
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,110
As for the third one...

586
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,310
Look, it's really eye-catching.

587
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,470
Look at this.

588
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,550
The Eighth Universe...

589
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,740
This... This... This...

590
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,350
The Husky Planet...

591
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,390
The story about the fallen
of the youngest great man...

592
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,310
It's

593
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,390
the Watt Empire of the Husgy Planet.

594
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,550
Is it Husgy?

595
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,950
Look, I've mistaken.

596
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,710
Right, it's the Husgy Planet.

599
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,390
Look at this introduction,

600
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,270
it caught my eyes.

601
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,310
But I think the third introduction

602
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,390
is too fanciful.

603
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,710
There's a few conversion
rules of the universe

604
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,670
that I haven't set clear.

605
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,670
Didn't I tell you that?

606
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,870
You don't have to think about it.

607
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,390
Let the readers think.

608
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,310
But I'm afraid the readers
can't understand.

609
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,750
It's not possible.

610
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,230
Right.

611
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,950
It's alright that they can't understand.

612
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,390
Just think this way.

613
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,950
The more odd it is,

614
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,910
the more serious they will read it.

615
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,550
There're many young readers,
they will think

616
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,230
that only they can understand it.

617
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,180
It's good.

Good, you deserve the encouragement.
Keep going.

If you haven't consulted doctor,

to have a check-up.

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,910
You can only keep writing

is quite bad.

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,570
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour: Don't work
overtime, come back and cook thechicken broth.]

739
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,270
Cook chicken broth?

740
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm getting drenched.

741
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,670
Cook chicken broth?

742
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:46,960
♫ I'm willing to make an eternal promise ♫

743
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,510
Chu Li,

744
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,230
why haven't you left?

745
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,230
Let me take you home
as it's raining heavily.

746
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,370
♫ Be the rotating star ♫

747
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,030
It's alright.

748
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,630
The bus stop and the subway station
are in different directions.

749
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:57,740
♫ Changing the life
from gloomy to crystal-clear ♫

750
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,110
Hurry up and go home.

751
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,510
-But out there...
-No "but".

752
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,190
You'll miss the bus.

753
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,110
Go!

754
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,230
All right.

755
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,710
Then I'm off.

756
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,350
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

757
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,950
Chu Li.

758
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,550
Mr Jiang?

759
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,070
How can you rush out
while it's raining heavily?

760
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,270
Aren't you afraid of catching cold?

761
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,350
I thought I can run to
the subway station

762
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,110
as it's close by.

763
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,900
Mr Jiang, what are you doing here?

764
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,150
Of course I'm here to pick you up.

765
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,710
Let's go. I'll take you home.

766
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,910
-Thank you, Mr Jiang.
-Let's go.

767
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,830
Has Stinky Monkey already left?

768
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,390
Jiang Yu Cheng!

769
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,350
What a coincidence!
Lucky that I meet you guys.

770
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,020
I didn't bring my umbrella.

771
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,750
Is that a coincidence?

772
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,110
Isn't Yuan Yue Publishing house nearby?

773
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:07,510
Yes.

774
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,840
I went to your bookstore
to get some books.

775
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,230
Where are the books?

776
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,390
I didn't get them.

777
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,660
Then I should ask Xiao Bai

778
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,350
why he didn't prepare the books.

779
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,230
I didn't get a chance to go there.

780
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,430
Didn't you come from
the direction of the bookstore?

781
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,150
Keep your mouth shut.

782
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,310
Don't tell me
you're here to pick Chu Li up.

783
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,660
Are you a dumb?

784
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,860
Why didn't I bring umbrella
if I was here to pick someone up?

785
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,230
Am I a fool?

786
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,830
I don't see you get drenched.

787
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,670
I...

788
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,590
I run fast.

789
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,310
He came from
the direction of the bookstore

790
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,830
and he didn't take any book.

791
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,590
Could he be...

792
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,550
Why are you sneaking around

793
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,630
at my door?

794
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,070
The hair dryer in my room is broken.

795
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,630
I want to ask if you can lend me yours.

796
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,670
Okay, hold on.

797
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,480
Why are you standing there?

798
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,310
Do you want me to teach you
how to use the hair dryer?

799
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,350
No.

800
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,900
Well, I'm going back to my room.

801
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,470
Wait.

802
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,020
You don't have to
return the hair dryer.

803
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,910
Everything you use will be broken.

804
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,510
I wonder

805
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,110
how your parents raised you.

806
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,190
Good night.

807
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,590
Are you

808
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,590
in love with me?
