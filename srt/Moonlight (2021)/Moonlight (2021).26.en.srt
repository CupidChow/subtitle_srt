Jiang Yu Cheng, are you free now?

8
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,390
The printing factory
got out of it unscathed?

9
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,310
Sort of.

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,830
Where is Chu Li?

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,740
She went to her room after lunch

12
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,199
and hasn't been out since.

13
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,030
And you are just going to stay here?

14
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,690
What a good boyfriend you are.

15
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,340
Maybe I should go upstairs
and check on her?

16
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,630
What's there to check?

17
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,030
Given her current state,

18
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,960
just a few words of advice
won't make her feel better.

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,430
Is there anything I can do to help then?

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,070
How are you and Gu Bai Zhi

21
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,950
doing lately?

22
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,040
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

23
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,470
I need verifications on several
news articles about the factory.

24
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,510
Since she has a lot of connections,

25
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,970
I need her to put me in
touch with a few people.

26
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,460
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

27
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,870
I am not.

28
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,630
I think

29
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,990
you can ask her yourself.

30
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,310
I ask her?

31
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,510
Then I will be
owing her a favour, won't I?

32
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,670
You can ask for me.

33
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,720
I will just get a free ride from you.

34

Don't you think you are getting

35
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,150
more and more shameless these days?

36
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,510
That depends on who
you're comparing me to,

37
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,630
if it's to you,

38
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,230
I admit defeat.

39
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,230
I've got other things to do, bye.

40
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,910
What other things?

41
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,470
I can't tell you.

Director Gu,

44
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,780
can you explain this to me?

45
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,630
What's wrong with these authors?

46
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,690
Why are they removed from
the Highly Recommended list?

47
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,710

48
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,190

49
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,790

been assigned to me,

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,380
Fine.

56
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,670

58
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,830

as soon as possible.

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,660

62
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,030
And some things are easier to get done

63
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,430
behind closed doors.

64
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,870
What do you mean by that?

75
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,260

results from you then.

Director Gu up from work?

79
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,230
Yes.

80
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,150
Just doing her job, huh?

81
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,030
Looks like you can't trust

82
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,490
anything that woman says.

83
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,900
What is that supposed to mean?

84
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,030
I suppose you know

85
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,950
Gu Bai Zhi better than I do, am I right?

86
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,750
Aren't you worried that
she has some other agenda?

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,390

93
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,710
Nothing.

94
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,030
Nothing important.

95

Go to sleep.

Why don't

110
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,190
you teach me how to play games?

111

Put you in a costume then, maybe?

How could you do this?

134
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,789
Even though I was sad and
frustrated last night,

135
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,710
that didn't mean you could
take advantage of my vulnerability.

136

asked me to stay last night.

I've been miserable lately.

145
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,750
I told her that Little Deity
has been widely praised.

146
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,430
Its sales volume is still rising,

147
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,230
it has almost exceeded 150,000 copies now.

148
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,910
She was only happy for ten minutes,

149
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,510
and then she went back
upstairs ten minutes later.

150
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,510
When the night came,

151
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,460
she just started to walk
around in the living room,

152
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,990
asking to catch a movie or play games,

153
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,630
and she had to drag me along.

154
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,590
On the next morning,

155
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,030
she kicked me out.

156
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,670
We kept doing this
round and round for days.

157
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,350
She has been behaving erratically,

158
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,550
like she has been drinking fake liquor.

159
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,030
I kind of get it now what does it mean by

160
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,710
attitude can change
faster than the weather.

161
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,190
Kicked you out? Kicked you out of where?

162
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,480
Is that the only thing you
heard after everything I said?

163
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,150
Our relationship is purely platonic.

164
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,300
I have affection for her,
but I respect her.

165
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,500
I never overstep the line.

166
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,630
I think

167
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,190
you are decent on the outside

168
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,520
and dirty on the inside.

169
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,070
What about you?

170
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,070
You are just jealous.

171
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,150
There is something wrong with your mood.

172
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,860
You looked like a
lovesick fool two days ago,

173
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,660
what's with the long face today?

174
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,110
Why are you being such a gossip?

175
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,660
You've listened to a lot of
my stories, haven't you?

176
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,260
You think I want to hear them?

177
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,950
It's all because of your strong
desire to express yourself.

178
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,310
You came telling me every time
something trivial happened.

179
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,910
I haven't even charged you
for relationship consultation fee.

180
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,230
Those relationship advice from you?

181
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,220
I had to wash my ears
after hearing your advice.

182
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,620
I haven't even asked you for compensation.

183
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,790
Let me record it down for you,

184
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,630
say it again.

185
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,670
Say you will never seek my advice

186
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,530
on relationship problems again.

187
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,350
Let me remind you kindly

188
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,110
and compassionately that

189
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,030
don't forget the tragic moment you had

190
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,550
when you broke up with her.

191
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,630
Don't come hugging and
crying to me in my house

192
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,760
for three days and three nights again.

193
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,110
Have you been fantasizing about me?

194
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,350
Who are you in a relationship with,

195
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,670
me or Chu Li?

196
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,190
Fine, you'd better not let
me catch you crying again.

197
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,590
Otherwise, I am going to
record it and upload it online

198
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,310
to show all the readers

199
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,750
what a crybaby you are.

200
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,370
All the videos on your phone are about me?

201
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,560
Do you really care about me that much?

202
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,190
Get lost!

203
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,230
This is a public place.

204
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,150
Why should I leave?

205
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,790
Fine, I will go.

206
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,590
Hold on.

207
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,790
The idea that you thought of
before, have you executed it?

208
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,590
Of course.

209
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,630
I have uploaded an 10,000 words
long article before I came here.

210
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,990
You want to denounce the printing factory?

211
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,670
You think I'm some kind
of single-celled creature?

212
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,270
Always use your head

213
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,590
to handle anything.

214
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,070
What?

215
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,140
The printing factory even
issued an apology statement.

216
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,460
The statement also said

217
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,630
they would carry out a
friendly negotiation with us

218
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,190
to cover the loss of
this mistake together.

219
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,830
Of course they should apologize.

220
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,030
This entire thing was their fault.

221
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,310
But I thought they were facing
difficulties in their business?

222
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,870
Why would they be
willing to cover the loss?

223
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,150
You'll have to ask
Mr Zhou Chuan about that.

224
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,350
And what's wrong with Zhou Chuan?

225
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,830
He actually posted a 10,000 words
long article on Weibo,

226
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,510
about the rise and fall
of Zhaoming Printing

227
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,510
over the past fifty years.

228
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,340
He even got a bunch
of writers in the circle

229
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,310
to share it for him.

230
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,590
This old factory that has

231
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,990
an epic and long history,

232
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,950
is poorly managed

233
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,950
and is facing talent loss

234
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,430
due to the external environment.

235
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,540
Such a

236
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,990
devastating story.

237
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,470
But this result is well enough,

238
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,790
isn't it?

239
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,470
It's a happy ending for everyone.

240
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,870
Not only our readers'
anger are dissipated,

241
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,470
but they also believed that Yuan Yue
Publishing House was being generous

242
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,670
for taking the fall for the old factory.

243
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,590
Honestly,

244
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,750
Zhou Chuan has made a really smart move.

245
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,790
But

246
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,670
the question is that after he did this,

247
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,110
who will still hold the managing editor,

248
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,270
Chu Li, for her

249
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,310
responsibility in this?

250
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,750
You see, now everyone believes that

251
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,390
the old factory's slip-up

252
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,750
was because of the external environment.

253
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,790
And the printing factory

254
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,020
is now speaking up for Chu Li,

255
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,100
as a thank you to Zhou Chuan
for creating a good publicity for them.

256
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,630
As a result, Yu Yao and Mr Xia

257
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,860
have gone to see Director Yang

258
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,190
to help Chu Li apply for reinstatement.

259
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,230
We can't have this, Mr Liang.

260
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,670
You have to step up and say something.

261
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,070
Miao, I think you are

262
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,590
getting carried away.

263
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,590
Don't make it personal.

264
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,590
No matter what you do,

265
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,340
you have to put yourself in
Yuan Yue Publishing House's place,

266
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,950
stop focusing on just one person,

267
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,630
am I right?

268
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,470
Now your top priority is to

269
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,620
manage the Animation Column well.

270
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,030
That's your priority, got it?

271
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,710
The result is good.

272
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,570
You've received so much support.

273
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,150
Now Chu Li should be
able to be reinstated soon.

274
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,190
It doesn't matter to me
whether she's reinstated or not.

275
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,790
I just couldn't stand

276
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,470
to see her being sad.

277
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,600
[Luo Wen]

278
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,230
Hello.

279
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,400
All right, I will be right over.

280
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,750
Go home now and coax your girlfriend.

281
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,870
Now is a good chance
for you to claim credit.

282
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,220
Is this Luo Wen

283
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,980
the same Luo Wen from Xin Dun?

284
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:31,860
Yes.

285
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,430
Gu Bai Zhi's boss?

286
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,260
He said he wanted to
talk to me about something.

287
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,190
Does Gu Bai Zhi know about this?

288
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,750
She

289
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,710
doesn't need to know.

290
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,500
Jiang Yu Cheng.

291
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,030
I don't care if you've
gotten back together again,

292
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,870
or if you have personal ties
with Luo Wen...

293
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,880
Just make sure you know what you're doing.

294
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,470
Chief Editor Yu is helping me
to get reinstated.

295
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,350
If all goes well,

296
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,150
I am going back to work next week.

297
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,380
Mr Zhou, you're so sweet.

298
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,070
Why are you so sweet?

299
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,110
Now you know how sweet I am.

300
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,300
But how have you been treating me
in the last two days?

301
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,230
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

302
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,490
See, I've prepared quite a feast for you.

303
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,470
I'm getting just a feast?

304
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,190
Are you happy now?

305
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,620
It's not enough.

306
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,030
You are home.

307
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,210
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

308
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,270
What's wrong?

309
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,550
Since when?

310
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,350
What do you mean?

311
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,420
Since when did you start using me

312
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,150
as a tool to get your promotion
as vice president?

313
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,710
Who told you that?

314
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,870
Answer me.

315
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,100
You've never been a tool to me,

316
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,590
not even once.

317
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,990
You are still lying even at this moment?

318
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,630
Have you been honest for even once?

319
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,589
Have you ever trusted me then?

320
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,190
You suspected that I gave your
manuscript to Yun Fei before,

321
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,780
now you are suspecting me

322
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,109
for using you as a tool for my promotion.

323
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,750
Right, I, Gu Bai Zhi, have been

324
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,470
using myself as bargaining
chip to play with you.

325
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,350
Happy now? Satisfied?

326
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,970
If you want my book,
I'll sign it with you.

327
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,550
If you want to be promoted
as vice president, I'll help you.

328
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,070
Just don't lie to me again.

329
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,050
I don't want to learn about
you from other people again.

330
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,500
If you have any real thoughts,

331
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,990
please tell me.

332
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,490
If you promise me this,

333
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,510
I will pretend nothing has happened.

334
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,030
Go ahead and pretend nothing has happened.

335
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,710
Jiang Yu Cheng,

336
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,030
are you feeling sorry for yourself now?

337
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,670
All these year, I, Gu Bai Zhi

338
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,690
have been approaching
you with an ulterior motive.

339
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,670
I was wrong, you were right.

340
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,710
We shouldn't have started over.

341
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,940
[The Disappearing Amusement Park]

342
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,110
[The Disappearing Amusement Park]

343
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,800
Where is the knife? Where is the knife?

344
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,910
What's the matter with you?

345
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,910
I'm going to kill Liang Chong Lang
that rascal.

346
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,470
Rascal!

347
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,910
-What's the matter with you?
-Let go of me!

348
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,310
-Let go of me!
-What did he do to you? Tell me!

349
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,710
I'm so mad right now.

350
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,790
Give me the knife.

351
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,070
I say,

352
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,270
Mr Liang, only you are capable of this.

353
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,790
You managed to

354
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,110
talk Director Yang out of

355
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,110
reinstating Chu Li.

356
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,340
And Mr Xia can't
even get mad at you.

357
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,030
Cut it out.

358
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,270
I didn't do that for you.

359
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,940
How did it go with the
popular comic book writer

360
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,870
you contacted?

361
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,130
Time is running short.

362
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,030
Don't worry,

363
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,190
Xiao Niao and I

364
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,420
have accumulated

365
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,390
a lot of resources.

366
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,820
You see,

367
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,830
I just learnt two new massage techniques

368
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,110
during my massage the other day.

369
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,590
Come, sit down, sit down.

370
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,350
Feel it.

371
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,830
Harder.

372
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,030
Harder.

373
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,710
I don't care.

374
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,070
She's like a different person now.

375
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,670
I kicked the trash can

376
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,950
by accident just now,

377
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,810
and she looked at me like
she was going to kill me.

378
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,950
How can she just turn hostile so quickly?

379
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,870
I don't care.

380
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,270
If you don't come sooner,
I'm dead for sure.

381
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,990
What are you doing?

382
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,950
Nothing.

383
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,030
I'm not doing anything.

384
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,830
Are you feeling bored right now?

385
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,190
No.

386
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,850
Go and work on your novel then.

387
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,430
Do the laundry too.

388
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,030
Okay.

389
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,230
Remember to mop the floor.

390
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,150
Sure.

391
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,190
What should

392
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,670
I do first?

393
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,180
Forget it.

394
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,400
You'd better come and help me cook.

395
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,710
[What is this?]

396
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,570
[A gift that should be given
to you three years ago.]

397
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,830
[If you want my book,
I'll sign it with you.]

398
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,510
[If you want to be promoted
as vice president, I'll help you.]

399
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,110
[Just don't lie to me again.]

400
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,150
[I don't want to learn about
you from other people again.]

401
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,750
Okay.

402
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,080
Hello, Director Gu.

403
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
No problem.

404
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,790
I'll see you next week then.

405
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,260
Okay.

406
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,630
Okay, bye.

407
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,910
Well played, Mr Luo.

408
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,360
What do you mean by that?

409
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,430
You told Jiang Yu Cheng, didn't you?

410
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,150
Well, you said you
were just doing your job.

411
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,470
So I suppose telling him wouldn't affect

412
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,550
your arrangement, right, Director Gu?

413
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,630
Of course.

414
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,030
These are the works you wanted
to put on Highly Recommended.

415
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,490
I've looked through them,
none of them pass.

416
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,750
You should stop interfering with

417
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,070
Content Planning Department's work,

418
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,330
so that you won't increase our workload.

419
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,750
The incident with the printing factory

420
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,270
has finally come to an end.

421
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,700
Thank you, Chief Editor Yu.

422
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,070
Since Chu Li has been suspended,

423
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,390
so naturally that I should
take care of these matters.

424
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,850
You don't have to thank me.

425
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,710
And about Chu Li's suspension,

426
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,470
is there anything I can do to help?

427
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,530
She has been suspended for a week now.

428
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,270
I've sent Ah Xiang to see her.

429
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,540
Chu Li can take care of it.

430
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,420
When the time comes,

431
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,990
we just have to give her a little help

432
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,070
at the critical moment.

433
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,950
Okay.

434
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,940
Qiu Qiu's birthday

435
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,790
is coming soon.

436
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,630
You'll come to his birthday party, right?

437
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,760
He'll be really happy when he sees you.

438
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,790
When I wasn't pregnant,

439
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,870
I said

440
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,820
you'd be Qiu Qiu's godmother.

441
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,310
Do you remember that?

442
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,110
Qiu Qiu has grown so much now.

443
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,950
Isn't it a bit strange to tell him

444
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,980
that he has a godmother all of a sudden?

445
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,300
No.

446
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,270
In fact, I often brought
you up in front of him.

447
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,790
He knows who you are.

448
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,150
It's okay.

449
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,030
We will see.

450
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,990
This should be the place.

451
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,670
Is this Mr Zhou Chuan and Chu Li's place?

452
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,910
I'm Ah Xiang.

453
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,270
Chief Editor Yu sent me here.

454
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,010
Is there a hope for her
reinstatement again?

455
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,470
Yes, Mr Zhou Chuan.

456
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,390
Have some water.

457
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,350
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

458
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,070
Have a seat.

459
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,940
So, actually,

460
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,030
Chief Editor Yu and Ms Suo Heng

461
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,790
were supposed to come with me.

462
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,220
But something came up

463
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,790
at the printing factory.

464
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,590
So I came alone.

465
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,470
How's it going?

466
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,700
The gifts have been sent out.

467
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,160
Everything is going well.

468
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,230
Good to hear that.

469
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,950
If it hadn't been Mr Liang's sabotaging,

470
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,180
you would've been reinstated by now.

471
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,910
But Mr Xia still got you

472
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,230
an opportunity from Director Yang.

473
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,430
You know that Yuan Yue Publishing House

474
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,420
is going to reinvent right?

475
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,350
Are you talking about
the new Animation Column?

476
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,670
Mr Liang and Miao have been wanting
to take charge of it for a long time.

477
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,900
It has probably been
assigned to them, hasn't it?

478
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,420
Other than the Animation Column,

479
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,710
Yuan Yue Publishing House

480
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,790
is also adding a New Writer Column
with greatest potential.

481
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,350
You will be in charge of this section.

482
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,830
New Writer Column.

483
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,750
Are you saying that

484
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,950
I am going to scout new writer?

485
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,710
Sort of.

486
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,740
Chief Editor Yu asked you to contact

487
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,430
the outstanding authors
whose follow-ups were picked

488
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,460
in the Interactive
Cultural Festival last year.

489
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,950
As long as you can recruit
a talented new writer,

490
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,410
you'll have no problem getting reinstated.

491
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,710
You got it.

492
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,750
As long as I can keep my job,

493
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,150
I'll do anything.

494
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,670
I will look through the follow-up articles

495
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,950
from the Interactive Cultural
Festival last year now.

496
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,950
I do remember one writer

497
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,280
whose article was good.

498
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,990
I know who you're talking about.

499
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,230
The Ghost Behind You!

500
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,420
Found it.

501
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,190
But I only found his QQ account.

502
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,350
That will do.

503
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,710
Hello.

504
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,380
I am the editor of Moonlight Magazine.

505
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,580
My name is Chu Li.

506
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,670
Looking forward to hearing from you.

507
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,420
I am feeling a little excited suddenly.

508
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,910
What are you excited about?

509
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,940
This is my first time
signing a new writer.

510
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,580
Whether it was you,

511
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,990
or Mr Jiang, or Ms Suo Heng,

512
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,230
you all have some experience
in book publishing.

513
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,430
This is the first time I'm
working with new writer.

514
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,030
He hasn't added you yet.

515
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,950
And you already knew you
are going to work with him?

516
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,510
He'll definitely say yes.

517
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,870
First, he chose your manuscript,

518
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,270
so he is most likely your fan.

519
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,990
Second, even if he isn't your fan,

520
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,230
among all manuscripts,

521
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,990
he and you were like-minded.

522
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,190
So if I can't persuade him,

523
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,790
I can send you to persuade him for me.

524
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,470
That's very cheeky of you.

525
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,300
You were still trying to stab your
husband to death a while ago.

526
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,590
Now you're thinking about
how to take advantage of me.

527
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,990
What a slap in the face.

528
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,870
You'd better not lose
your job again in future,

529
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,390
otherwise, I might as well
just sleep with Er Gou,

530
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,710
it's safer for me.

531
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,230
What nonsense are you talking about?

532
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,390
Who is my husband?

533
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,790
What do you think?
Who else do you think it is?

534
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,310
You haven't answered my question.

535
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,910
You, you, of course it's you.

536
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,630
Now that's more like it.

537
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,290
[Ghost]

538
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,390
Goodness,

539
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,020
This kid is generous

540
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,100
in using exclamation mark.

541
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,690
Let me send him a few topics and ask
him to submit his drafts as try-out.

542
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,540
Director,

543
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,950
I've sent you the information via email.

544
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,030
I'm going take off now.

545
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,820
Okay, get home safe.

546
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,020
We need to talk.

547
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,910

But what he wrote here

572
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,390
is considered a joke,

let me ask you,

707
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,510
if a book is incomprehensible to you,

708
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,570
will you introduce it to the readers?

709
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,150

710
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,670
we'll find other ways.

it's normal that they can't
accept it for the moment.

the broad sense of incomprehensibility,

719
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,470
the issue here lies with
the reader's age group.

720
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,700
I can't just give up
Ghost's novel like this.

that's okay,

724
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,420
but this isn't something
that can be achieved overnight.

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,670
I know,

726
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,380

transforming themselves.

on the market soon.

732
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,510
But you have to give Mr Xia time

733
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,030
to understand ACG genre.

734
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,550
It's easy for us to understand ACG,

735
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,310
but it's hard for Mr Xia.

736
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,550
No.

737
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,260
Why must we get Mr Xia understand it?

738
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,070
Besides, what more can we do?

739
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,470
Yes, yes, let me tell you...

740
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,820
Mr Xia!

741
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,140
Mr Xia.

742
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,220
Chu Li, what are you doing here?

743
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,270
Don't you know

744
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,390
you are under suspension?

745
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,270
Miao.

746
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,190
Fine, I'll get on with my work.

747
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,990
Side ponytail is a common hairstyle

748
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,580
for women in anime.

749
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,470
Most characters who
show up with this hairstyle,

750
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,670
they are either dead or going to be dead.

751
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,950
That's why she wrote

752
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,150
"Madam, your hairstyle is dangerous."

753
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,470
The season for white album is winter.

754
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,430
Whenever there is a love triangle
between two women fighting for a man,

755
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,470
people will say,

756
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,790
"This is the season of the white album."

757
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,940
After you explained it,

758
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,230
I get it now.

759
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,950
But you can't explain it

760
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,950
to the reader one by one.

761
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,510
Not everyone

762
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,470
can understand Ghost's novel,

763
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,620
but there must be
a certain group of readers

764
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,950
that will really like and appreciate her.

765
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,230
As long as our New Writer Column

766
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,990
can seize these readers' attention,

767
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,780
we are already half success.

768
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,950
What I'm about to say
may sound a bit overconfident,

769
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,940
but please trust my judgment.

770
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,140
Ghost will definitely become
the most popular author

771
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,870
in the New Writer Column.

772
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,830
Fine.

773
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,790
You want me to trust your judgment.

774
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,830
Tell me then,

775
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,990
what kind of book do you want to publish?

776
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,910
What kind of energy do you
want to convey to reader?

777
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,750
I believe that the energies that a book

778
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,150
can convey to the reader are diverse.

779
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,830
It doesn't have to have
profound ideologies

780
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,470
or educational significance.

781
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,950
As long as it can move the reader
for even just one second,

782
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,750
it's a book that I'm willing to push
through all obstacles to work on.

783
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,710
Did it really make you that happy?

784
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,430
Of course.

785
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,150
Not only did I convince Mr Xia,

786
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,670
but I might get reinstated too.

787
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,350
This would be another highlight

788
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,030
of my year.

789
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,550
What if Mr Xia wasn't convinced?

790
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,220
Not likely to happen.

791
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,300
Entrenchment is
the biggest taboo for a literati.

792
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,350
A literati should be

793
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,790
tolerant to diversity.

794
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,830
Just because Mr Xia was taken aback by

795
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,710
the sudden emergence of
a new generation of literature,

796
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,550
it doesn't mean he rejects it.

797
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,030
Are you that confident?

798
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,750
Yes.

799
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,230
Otherwise, Moonlight Magazine
wouldn't have carried out a reinvention.

800
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,430
I believe that Moonlight Magazine
can definitely

801
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,950
introduce these new generation literature

802
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,860
to those who miss out
on great literary works

803
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,910
because of their traditional stereotype.

804
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,830
Like Mr Xia.

805
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,270
Like your dad.

806
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,270
What are you doing?

807
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,710
We are still in the company.

808
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,350
What? I just want to hold your hand.

809
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,320
Do we really need so many books?

810
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,510
Of course.

811
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,070
When Ghost's novel

812
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,550
is published,

813
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,870
as her editor,

814
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,470
I have to understand

815
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,270
all the references of ACG first

816
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,750
before I can evaluate her content.

817
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,900
You really are...

818
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,630
Really are what...

819
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,430
You really are making me proud.

820
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,390
What are you doing?
This is a public space.

821
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,440
Don't worry, I checked, no one's looking.

822
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,190
Tell me,

823
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,230
if I didn't run

824
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,750
when we first met,

825
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,290
what would have happened?

826
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,310
When we first met?

827
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,710
The first time I found out
you were Monkey was here.

828
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,550
[Mr Zhou Chuan?]

829
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,910
No wonder you ran
away so fast that time.

830
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,790
Weren't you afraid you were
going to fall down hard?

831
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,750
Will you still want me
if I disfigure my face?

832
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,030
Of course not.

833
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:57,910
What are you doing?

834
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,860
-Grabbing a book.
-Come down.

835
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,430
Come down.

836
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,230
I'll get it for you.

837
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,430
Get me The Garden of Sinners.

838
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,590
Okay.

839
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,170
[Natsume Soseki Collection]

840
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,470
[Sir.]

841
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,310
Have you forgotten that you snatched

842
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,550
Natsume Soseki's Crime from me?

843
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,970
I gave it back to you
after that, didn't I?

844
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,390
But aren't you going to apologize me

845
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,270
after you made a mistake?

846
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,830
Come here.

847
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,460
Why?

848
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,830
I'm going to make it up to you.
