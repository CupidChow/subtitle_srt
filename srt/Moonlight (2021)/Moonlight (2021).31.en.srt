193
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,710
No, no, Mr Liang.

194
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,230
If I could fix it myself,

195
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,030
I wouldn't have asked you.

196
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,110
Look,

197
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,510
could you please

198
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,950
talk to Mr Shu Hua again?

199
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,870
Miao,

200
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,730
why are you becoming
more short-sighted recently?

201
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,980
Do I have to tell you

202
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,510
how much Zhou Chuan is worth?

203
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,990
First, he worked with Maurer.

204
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,550
Now, he's nominated for Huazhi Award.

205
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,580
I wish I could win him over.

206
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,710
Now you want me to cancel his interview,

207
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,240
what are you even thinking?

208
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,030
-But, but...
-There's no room for discussion.

209
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,430
Miao,

210
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,070
you're the deputy editor
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

211
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,470
No matter what you do,

212
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,510
the benefit of Yuan Yue should come first.

213
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,790
Get it?

214
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,360
Focus on the issue, not the person.

215
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,630
Be good.

216
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,580
Mr Liang.

217
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,190
Hello.

218
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,630
Regarding your proposal last time,

219
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,790
I've made up my mind.

220
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,790
Don't worry.

221
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,660
Regarding the writer,

222
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,160
I'll take care of it.

223
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,110
Contact our new illustrator for me.

224
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,190
I want to discuss the new cover.

225
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,550
As for Yun Fei,

226
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,550
print out the manuscript,

227
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,550
I will read it now.

228
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,750
Director Gu,
you've just returned from a business trip,

229
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,350
won't you take a few days off?

230
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,040
[Jiang Yu Cheng]

231
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,550
Hello, are you...

232
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,790
[I have sent you
the revised opinions of the novel.]

233
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,870
Send it to me after you fix it.

234
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,630
Director Lu will amend the script soon,

235
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,750
get ready as soon as you can.

236
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,670
[I'm very busy now.]

237
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,510
[Goodbye.]

238
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,430
Is she still the same?

239
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,630
Yeah.

240
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,670
After Ms Liu's funeral,

241
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,620
she went for a business trip.

242
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,910
Since then,

243
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,710
every time I called her,

244
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,390
she'd be occupied with work.

245
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,310
Even Tang said

246
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,470
that she is now

247
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,670
like a working machine with no emotion.

248
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,990
After we left the hospital,

249
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,470
she never cried

250
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,390
or talked about Ms Liu even once.

251
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,030
At the funeral,

252
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,510
she never even shed a tear.

253
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,030
The way she heals herself

254
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,550
is almost like torturing herself.

255
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,230
Alright,

256
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
I've brought you the books you want.

257
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,990
Do your best

258
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,910
in Maurer's script.

259
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,750
I'm leaving.

260
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,550
Figure something out,

261
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,950
she can't go on like this.

262
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,110
I know.

263
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,340
Hello.

264
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,230
[SOS. Help me!]

265
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,730
[Little Monkey]

266
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,710
Oh, God. Finally you're here.

267
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,990
What is going on?

268
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,670
Why are you having dinner with her?

269
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,340
She insisted on asking me out for dinner.

270
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,830
Alright, sorry.

271
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,030
I will inform you in advance
in the future.

272
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,580
Did you drink?

273
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,070
Of course not.

274
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,190
I know very well

275
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,950
how bad I am at drinking.

276
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,950
Good.

277
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,910
Let's go.

278
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,350
Don't be associated
with this kind of people.

279
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,830
Hang on, hang on.

280
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,950
She's a celebrity.

281
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,630
I can't leave her here.

282
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,430
Call her assistant.

283
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,270
I called, but no one answered.

284
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,350
What should we do?

285
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,910
I think her driver is here.

286
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,950
When I got here,

287
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,630
I saw a MPV out there.

288
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,870
I'll go look for it.

289
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,990
I'll go with you.

290
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,710
No, no.

291
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,260
-Stay here and keep an eye on her.
-I...

292
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,750
Please, I beg you.

293
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,150
Zhou Chuan,

294
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,070
is that you?

295
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,070
It's really you.

296
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,470
I thought I was wrong.

297
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,470
Don't go.

298
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,060
I really want to work with you.

299
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,070
Although I can't publish any book for you,

300
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,660
I will use my best form

301
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,070
to portray the character in your novel

302
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,030
and showcase your work.

303
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,670
Do you really hate me that much?

304
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,750
I really envy Chu Li
because you're by her side.

305
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,829
There's someone whom I like as well.

306
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,540
I like him for many years.

307
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,940
Since secondary school.

308
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,740
You've drunk a lot, haven't you?

309
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,339
What did you say?

310
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,060
Zhou Chuan!

311
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,120
Are you done with your play?

312
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,030
Do you really have no feelings for me?

313
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,590
I think you're really sick.

314
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,670
Zhou Chuan.

315
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,670
I won't sell the royalties
of Book of Luo He God to you.

316
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,350
Just give up.

317
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,790
Please do not

318
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,920
disturb me and my girlfriend anymore.

319
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,190
Don't you regret it
after leaving this place!

320
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,030
I don't have as many fans as you do
on Weibo,

321
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,870
but I still have my influence.

322
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,950
If you dare disturb us again,

323
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,390
I will write a post on Weibo,

324
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,350
and expose some of your stuff.

325
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,790
I mean it.

326
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,460
Let's go.

327
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,510
Let's go home.

328
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,150
Why... Why?

329
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,700
[Notre-Dame de Paris]

330
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,900
That's what she thinks of you?

331
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,150
This is a big news!

332
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,310
Why would you be so surprised?

333
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,940
Oh, God.

334
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,190
That was an amazing moment,

335
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,670
it's too bad
that I couldn't see it myself.

336
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,730
That was a terrible acting.
You ought to save your time.

337
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,750
When did you start noticing it?

338
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,700
When

339
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,750
she said she was late.

340
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,550
Oh, goodness!

341
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,670
I didn't know that,

342
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,350
you're actually an expert
in exposing shrews!

343
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,030
I didn't notice that back then.

344
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,760
I've seen a lot,
so I have some experience in this.

345
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,700
You've seen a lot?

346
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,750
You'd better come clean.

347
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,870
You should've seen this coming.

348
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,230
Look at my face,

349
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,790
I've been popular since I was young.

350
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,950
You've been popular since you were young.

351
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,830
Come over here!

352
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,630
You'd better be honest with me,

353
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,990
Otherwise I'll punish you
if you try to resist.

354
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,940
Only you.

355
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,550
What do you mean?

356
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,780
Since I was young,

357
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,470
you've been the only one.

358
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,990
That's more like it.

359
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:40,990
Oh, right!

360
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,630
I forgot to tell you something important.

361
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,750
Mr Shu Hua wants to interview you.

362
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,210
He's from that famous show,
Interview with All.

363
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,350
Interview?

364
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,950
That's too much of a trouble. I won't go.

365
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,750
No, it's no trouble at all.

366
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,310
Do you know how many writers

367
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,990
are dying to be on his show?

368
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,470
Go, just go!

369
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,430
What is it?

370
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,110
How is it?

371
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,700
Fine.

372
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,510
I'll inform Chief Editor Yu now.

373
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,720
Zhou Chuan is going to Interview with All.

374
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,870
What are you doing here?

375
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,010
I got a call from the nursing home.

376
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,470
They said
you haven't picked up Ms Liu's stuff.

377
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,820
You refused to go, did you?

378
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,550
I'll go there when I have time.

379
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,380
How long do you plan
on running away from it?

380
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,700
If you don't move on,

381
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,190
Ms Liu will not rest in peace.

382
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,630
Come.

383
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,950
I'll go with you.

[Etymology]

385
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,870
[Etymology]

386
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,420
[Etymology]

387
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,230
[Lin,]

388
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,150
[before I started writing this letter,]

389
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,390
[I had heard about you]

390
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,710
[from someone.]

391
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,910
[You're gone.]

392
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,940
[We hadn't met much in this lifetime,]

393
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,940
[but the letters you wrote for me]

394
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,100
[Etymology]

395
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,630
[are stacking up in a box.]

396
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,310
[However, before you departed,]

397
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,420
[you had not left any message]

398
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,550
[for me.]

399
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,030
[At first I thought
you had left me behind.]

400
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,830
[I was in extreme fear and longing.]

401
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,940
[I even held grudges against you.]

402
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,630
[However, when I woke up in a muddle,]

403
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,360
[with tears in my eyes
in the middle of the night,]

404
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,430
[I opened the window,]

405
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,950
[and I saw the Milky Way]

406
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,190
[and a sky full of stars.]

407
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,750
[It was like you were still here.]

408
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,390
[All of a sudden, I felt relieved.]

409
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,190
[Starting from this moment,]

410
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,350
[I will not be afraid anymore.]

411
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,710
[I will maintain the grace and calmness]

412
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,870
[which you love,]

413
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,310
[and walk slowly towards the end of life.]

414
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,310
[And all this calmness]

415
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,460
[comes from you.]

416
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,390
[I know.]

417
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,510
[You will keep your promise]

418
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,990
[and wait for me
at the end of the journey.]

419
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,990
[Wait for me.]

420
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,460
[When we finally meet again,]

421
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,540
[I will tell you]

422
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,990
[everything which I've seen
in this journey.]

423
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,590
[Death is not the end of separation,]

424
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,910
[we're just waiting
for a chance to meet again.]

425
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,470
Death

426
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,190
is not the end of separation,

427
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,520
but it's a chance for another reunion.

428
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,030
Do you think she will remember me?

429
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,670
Come with me.

430
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,750
Ms Liu will remember you.

431
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,470
She's one of the stars now.

432
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,430
Every time you look at the stars,

433
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,470
she's looking at you too.

434
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,980
[Shu Mei]

435
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,230
Gu Bai Zhi.

436
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,300
You will never be alone.

437
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,990
I'm here.

438
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,990
[Ms Liu,]

439
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,950
[thank you for taking care of me
after my parents are gone.]

440
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,150
[Thank you for being my mother
and my family.]

441
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,430
[Thank you for giving me a home.]

442
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,070
Listen,

443
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,780
Mr Shu Hua

444
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,540
is famous for being incisive.

445
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,110
You must think it over

446
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,830
before answering any question, get it?

447
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,110
Got it.

448
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,700
You've been repeating it since yesterday.

449
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
Even a goldfish can remember it now.

450
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,630
I'm leaving.

451
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,870
Zhou Chuan!

452
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,060
You can do it!

453
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,430
Mr Zhou Chuan, welcome.

454
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,230
-Hello. Thank you.
-Please sit.

455
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,510
I'm really happy that today you're willing

456
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,150
to accept our interview.

457
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,630
It's my pleasure.

458
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,390
So now, we'll start

459
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,190
-with simple questions.
-Sure.

460
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,340
Mr Zhou Chuan,

461
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,190
did you write Book of Luo He God

462
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,950
all by yourself?

463
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,870
Don't worry.

464
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,750
Mr Zhou Chuan can handle that.

465
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,390
Somehow,

466
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,910
I'm very nervous.

467
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,790
He'll be fine.

468
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,350
How did it go?

469
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,670
It was alright.

470
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,870
I'll go home first. See you tonight.

471
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:52,020
[It's coming, it's coming. I'm the first!
Zhou Chuan is here. First row. Ah ah ah!]

472
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,350
[Did you write Book of Luo He God]

473
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,300
[all by yourself?]

474
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,630
[This question]

475
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,900
[is rather strange.]

476
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,340
[Why did you say so?]

477
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,070
[It's like
I'm looking into your eyes now]

478
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,070
[and say,]

479
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,590
["Are you Mr Shu Hua?",]

480
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,010
[or did you hire someone else to fool me?]

481
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,510
[You're funny, Mr Zhou Chuan. However,]

482
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,010
[you have not answered my question yet.]

483
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,910
[I will answer you now,]

484
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,950
[I wrote Book of Luo He God myself.]

485
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,750
[Because, someone said]

486
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,810
[that your father]

487
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,550
[wrote this book for you.]

488
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,950
[I'm very curious about it as well.]

489
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,350
[If you or any netizen]

490
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,110
[find out the answer,]

491
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,710
[please let me know.]

492
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,590
[Have you thought about the reason]

493
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,190
[this rumour came out of nowhere?]

494
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,390
[Do you think it is a groundless rumour]

495
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,250
[or there's a cause for this?]

496
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,300
[I think it is more like]

497
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,630
[a cock and bull story.]

498
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,030
[But rumours are spreading
on the internet,]

499
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,030
[why hasn't your father]

500
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,670
[said something about it?]

501
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,790
[This question is too much.
Zhou Chuan is tough too. Get back at him.]

502
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,030
[He never surfs the internet,]

503
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,790
[so where can he express his thoughts?]

504
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,130
[Yeah, answer him.
That was too much. Get back at him.]

505
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,430
[There's something I'm curious about.]

506
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,070
[When you write,]

507
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,510
[does your father]

508
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,150
[I support Mr Zhou Chuan. Zhou Chuan
switched topic. Zhou Chuan is mean too.]

509
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,710
[discuss the plot with you?]

510
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,190
[Just a nobody LOL.
Shu Hua went overboard.]

511
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,520
[He didn't even answer the question.
Beat him at his own game.]

512
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,230
[No.]

513
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,510
[So,]

514
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,910
[does he not know
the content of your book?]

515
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,940
[He dared not answer it.
It hit home. He couldn't answer it.]

516
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,310
[He knows the answer,
but he couldn't say it.]

517
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,110
[Sorry.]

518
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,270
[Are you interviewing me]

519
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,130
[Zhou Chuan, we support you.
Support Mr Zhou Chuan.]

520
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,270
[or my father?]

521
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,950
[You, of course.]

522
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,310
[Let's do it this way.]

523
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,430
[When you were writing,]

524
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,950
[has your dad ever instructed you?]

525
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,780
[Can a VIP like me watch this?
This is a heated interview.]

526
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,750
[No.]

527
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,030
[It's quite peaceful here.
I trust Mr Zhou Chuan.]

528
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,190
[But I wonder,]

529
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,720
[Who knows what is the truth?
Diss him. This is painful to watch.]

530
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,460
[you're actually inheriting
your father's career.]

531
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,910
[I think the child...]

532
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,110
[This is pissing me off.
Yeah, he's interviewing Zhou Chuan.]

533
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,830
[If you don't have any other questions]

534
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,030
[regarding Book of Luo He God,]

535
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,390
[How can he say that?]

536
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,830
[I think we should]

537
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,790
[Yeah, who is this about?
Mr Zhou Chuan is pissed off.]

538
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,750
[call it a day.]

539
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,870
[I'll give you my father's number.]

540
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,050
[He's got guts. This is unbelievable.
Mr Zhou Chuan is mad.]

541
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,800
[Alright then.]

542
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,590
[Hold on, hold on.]

543
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,580
[Here's my final question.]

544
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,230
[I'm really interested]

545
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,310
[in the story.]

546
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,950
[There are a lot of sacred beasts]

547
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,470
[in Book of Luo He God.]

548
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,270
[Did you get the inspirations]

549
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,400
[from Classic of Mountains and Seas?]

550
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,390
Zhou Chuan!

551
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,430
What's wrong?

552
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,990
You scared the hell out of me.

553
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,990
What happened
to your interview with Shu Hua?

554
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,230
It was alright?

555
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,740
Do you know that the netizens

556
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,470
are calling you Mr No-it-all?

557
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,260
Mr No-it-all?

558
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,900
I answered all his questions.

559
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,350
Mr No-it-all means

560
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,980
you avoided all the questions,

561
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,910
but the answers were
not convincing at all.

562
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,550
I just said what was on my mind.

563
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,140
Then how can you not even know

564
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,030
the birth details of the beasts
in Book of Luo He God?

565
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,790
You're their father.

566
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,950
Just ask any writer

567
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,070
who published two books

568
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,790
these kind of details.

569
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,150
Even if he doesn't have hyperthymesia,

570
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,810
he also definitely
can't answer this question.

571
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,310
You're right.

572
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,270
When I went through the manuscripts

573
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,150
for Mr Jiang and Ms Suo Heng,

574
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,060
they'd forget about the setting.

575
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,870
Exactly.

576
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,580
This is a norm in the writers' circle.

577
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,150
It's very normal.

578
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,190
Then why didn't you explain it

579
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,790
in the interview?

580
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,620
The audience don't belong to your circle,

581
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,030
they might not know your norm.

582
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,430
Great. Now the bullet comments
keep saying

583
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,390
that you might have actually

584
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,430
hired a ghostwriter.

585
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,630
Because you don't even know

586
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,070
the details of your own novel.

587
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,430
This is not the first time
I heard about this.

588
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,790
Since I was nominated for Huazhi Award,

589
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,510
I've heard a lot of rumours like this.

590
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,390
But...

591
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,630
I have a call.

592
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,870
Hello, what's wrong?

593
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,990
What's wrong?

594
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,530
What do you think is wrong?

595
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,040
[Let me ask you,]

596
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,830
what was going on with that interview?

597
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,470
Haven't you seen it already?

598
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,310
[That was a live show.]

599
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,550
If you couldn't speak properly,

600
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,030
you should've have gone there.

601
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,950
[You were just fooling around.]

602
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,950
What kind of answers were those?

603
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,270
[You didn't clarify]

604
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,710
[what you should've clarified.]

605
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,750
Did I teach you to speak like that?

606
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,820
[No.]

607
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,470
I'd never even learnt.

608
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,190
You...

609
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,750
Why do you act like this wherever you go?

610
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,990
If someone ever asks you again,

611
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,710
just be frank and tell them,

612
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,870
your father never likes your work.

613
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,750
Fine.

614
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,190
I will definitely tell them,

615
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,510
with your limited skills,
you can't come up with my work.

616
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,790
What did you say?

617
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,910
Give it to me.

618
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,590
Give it to me.

619
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,510
He's pissing me off.

620
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,160
Just be quiet
if you don't know what to say.

621
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,980
Son,

622
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,310
[you've never done that,]

623
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,790
[so don't be afraid.]

624
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,470
[Let them say whatever they want.
We don't care.]

625
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,710
I know.

626
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,390
You must be tired.

627
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,710
Come home if you're tired.

628
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,830
So if I want to prove that I'm doing fine,

629
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,230
I can't go home.

630
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,030
Don't get smart with me.

631
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,070
Take good care of yourselves.

632
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,350
As for me,

633
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,860
you can rest assured.

634
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,060
Alright.

635
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,190
What's wrong?

636
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,830
Who was that?

637
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,990
That old man at home.

638
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,710
Look,

639
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,950
this is starting to get out of hands.

640
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,950
Is it possible

641
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,670
for you to go home and talk to your dad,

642
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,990
so that he can speak up?

643
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,300
The problem might be easier to solve.

644
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,950
I won't go home.

645
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,350
But if the words get around,

646
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,230
his name will be...

647
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,110
He doesn't like attention,

648
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,310
not to mention

649
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,230
getting attention because of me.

650
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,550
But you've never done that.

651
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,990
Why would you let people
spread such rumours?

652
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,350
Just ignore those stupid netizens.

653
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,790
I know you're worried about me,

654
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,940
but I'm fine.

655
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,190
Calm down.

656
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,020
I'm not broke

657
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,780
or homeless like a beggar,

658
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,590
I still can afford

659
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,550
Er Gou's canned food and your rice.

660
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,990
Could you be serious?

661
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,070
Besides, it was me who bought the rice.

662
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,190
Your greatest contribution

663
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,180
is the two cucumbers inside the fridge.

664
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,500
You're right.

665
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,390
This home

666
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,790
can't do without you.

667
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,860
Tell me.

668
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,990
The enthusiasm of those netizens

669
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,990
will only last for two days, right?

670
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,950
Yes.

671
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,480
[Zhou Gu Xuan]

672
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,179
[Zhou Gu Xuan is the ghost writer
of his son, Zhou Chuan?]

673
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,370
[No wonder Zhou Chuan was nominated
for Huazhi Award at such a young age]

674
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,320
[He's not gifted,
but his father wrote his work.]

675
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,139
[@Zhou Gu Xuan,
are you worthy of your reputation?]

676
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,270
[Don't call yourselves writers any more.
Scammers suit you better.]

677
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,550
Comb your hair.

678
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,270
Hello, Ah Xiang.

679
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,470
What?

680
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,710
How could she do that?

681
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,510
Alright, I'll check it now.

682
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:22,170
[Song Xi speaks up, Song Xi, Zhou Chuan]

683
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,670
What's going on?

684
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,870
No... Nothing.

685
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,920
I still can see it
even if you don't tell me.

686
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,070
Song Xi...

687
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,910
[Have you heard? It's been cancelled.]

688
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,850
[Song Xi]

689
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,390
[You ought to know very well
what has been cancelled.]

690
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,610
[Assistant of Song Xi, Mona]

691
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,060
[Xi Xi always cares about her reputation.]

692
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,310
[She will never buy]

693
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,700
[intellectual property rights
with infringement.]

694
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,270
[Don't worry about it.]

695
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,710
[Now we can confirm
that Zhou Chuan hired a ghostwriter.]

696
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,980
[She gave up his royalties.]

697
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,620
[Zhou Chuan's fans will be pissed.]

698
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,140
[Great.
I'm now officially a fan of Song Xi.]

699
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,510
She's gone overboard.

700
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,740
Why don't we release a statement?

701
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,630
If we do it now,

702
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,750
they'll think that we're in denial.

703
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,420
I'll answer a call.

704
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,750
If you think

705
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,110
that the royalties for the comic adaption
of Book of Luo He God is too expensive,

706
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,310
we don't need to collaborate this time.

707
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,940
If we don't collaborate this time,

708
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,870
we don't have to collaborate anymore.

709
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,870
I'm not trying to threaten anyone here.

710
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,910
Bye.

711
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,860
Hello.

712
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,270
[Mr Zhou Chuan,]

713
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,030
[regarding the Oriental Beauty game,]

714
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,070
[our legal department]

715
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,510
[would like to revise the contract.]

716
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,550
It's fine.

717
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,440
I've decided not to sell it.

718
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,430
[Mr Zhou Chuan, sorry to bother you.]

719
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,710
[Regarding the movie royalties
of Huang Quan Inn,]

720
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,390
[can you lower the price?]

721
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,350
[You're the talk of the town now.]

722
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,830
Do you think I'm a beggar?

723
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,190
I think...

724
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,030
Let's take the high road.

725
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,390
Don't be angry.

726
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,070
Give me my phone.

727
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,350
I'm not angry. I don't mind it.

728
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,270
Assistant Fang.

729
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,590
That is Mr Maurer's assistant.

730
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,540
Hello.

731
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,190
Okay.

732
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,390
I respect Mr Maurer's decision.

733
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,550
What was it about?

734
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,030
They...

735
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,350
They want me
to clarify the rumours as soon as possible

736
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,880
so that we can collaborate.

737
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,110
Why even Mr Maurer

738
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,550
would believe these rumours?

739
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,820
He's a big shot.

740
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,460
Big shots are cautious
with their choice of working partners.

741
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,860
This is understandable.

742
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,470
I'm going to the market.

743
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,070
But...

744
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,870
What should I do?

745
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,990
[Zhou Chuan is a literature blockhead.]

746
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,820
[A fake writer who gained fame
with ghostwriter.]

747
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,230
[A wolf in a sheep's skin.]

748
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,310
[I'm ashamed to admit]

749
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,070
[that I used to be his fan.]

750
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,470
[If he sells all his novels and autograph]

751
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,800
[with just 10 yuan, would anyone want it?]

752
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,070
[He's incompetent, doesn't even know
what to say in an interview.]

753
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,110
[The successor to the ghostwriter.]

754
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,230
[This is the first time they nominated
unconventional literature,]

755
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,310
[but the writer created this scandal.]

756
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,350
[Huazhi Award is so unlucky.]

757
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,150
[Celebrities might break my heart,]

758
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,910
[now even a writer let me down.]

759
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,110
[I've had enough of scammers
like Zhou Chuan.]

760
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,310
[His whole package seemed so perfect.]

761
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,910
[The Gentle and Kind Mr Chuan?]

762
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,350
[He's a fake writer Chuan,
the scammer of literature.]

763
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,430
[Why haven't the father and son
apologised yet?]

764
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,290
[Family background matters nowadays.
It's nice to rely on your dad.]

765
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,420
[Jiang Yu Cheng]

766
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,420
Hello, Mr Jiang.

767
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,390
Hello, Chu Li.

768
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,030
Is Zhou Chuan doing alright?

769
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,470
I've been calling him the entire day

770
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,200
but he never answered my calls.

771
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,340
I think he's fine.

772
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,670
Just give him some space.

773
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,070
By the way, Mr Jiang,

774
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,310
I'm going to work starting from tomorrow.

775
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,270
When you have time,

776
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,330
[could you spend some time with him?]

777
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,510
Sure.

778
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,550
I'm hanging up. He's home.

779
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,110
Where have you been?

780
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,310
Why did you come home so late?

781
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,790
Dinner is ready.

782
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,070
Jiang Yu Cheng asked me
to play squash with him.

783
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,400
I played for an entire day. I'm exhausted.

784
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,910
Let's eat dinner.

785
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,820
Sure.

786
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,140
Chu Li,

787
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,310
is Mr Zhou Chuan alright?

788
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,780
He's alright.

789
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,310
It wasn't such a big deal

790
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,590
at the beginning,

791
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,270
it's all Song Xi's fault.

792
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,230
She wrote that post on Weibo
and it became a hot search.

793
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,350
Now,

794
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,030
Mr Zhou Chuan's Weibo
is flooded with angry comments.

795
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,630
I'm worried to death.

796
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,070
Do you believe him?

797
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,390
Of course I do.

798
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,550
Chu Li, you have to tell Mr Zhou Chuan,

799
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,900
long-time readers like us

800
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,780
trust him very much.

801
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,750
Chief Editor Yu.

802
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,670
We've contacted Shu Hua,

803
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,400
he refused to remove the video.

804
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,350
That's even better.

805
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,660
Otherwise the keyboard warriors
would think

806
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,070
that Mr Zhou Chuan
has a guilty conscience.

807
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,130
Anyway, don't worry about it.

808
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,590
I've spoken to Mr Xia.

809
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:16,510
He's asked the legal department
to draft a statement.

810
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,310
The editing department
will post it right away

811
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,710
to give Mr Zhou Chuan our full support.

812
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,950
If it is necessary,

813
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,750
we will

814
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,790
take legal action

815
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,750
against the false statements online.

816
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,280
Thank you, Chief Editor Yu.

817
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,750
For what?

818
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,030
I've halted the legal department.

819
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,030
Mr Liang,

820
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,390
what do you mean?

821
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,910
Come in for a meeting.

822
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,870
Meeting.

823
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,390
[Where are you? Something came up.]
