[Episode 11]

4
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,210
Chu Li, what happened to your leg?

5
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,830
It's fine. I just fell down.

6
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,479
Why are you so happy
even though you fell down?

7
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,470
Am I?

8
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,270
Yes.

9
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,229
Look in the mirror
if you don't believe me.

10
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,550
Your face is all red.

11
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,110
And you can't stop smiling.

12
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,830
I'm happy.

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,220
Enough. Let's go in.

14
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,550
-Let's go.
-Be careful.

15
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,820
Oh my goodness.

16
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,430
Are these my books?

17
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,390
I've been imagining this

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,550
for so long.

19
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,060
Finally, I can see them for myself.

20
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,270
They are printed out so nicely.

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,470
Chu Li.

23
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,950
These are the discarded ones
because the colours are too off.

24
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,110
I know.

25
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm too excited because
this is my first time seeing them.

26
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,550
By the way,

27
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,670
was that the 4-Colour Heidelberg?

28
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,070
I heard that it's
four million per machine.

29
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,030
Four million.

30
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,190
Chu Li, who are you...

31
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,430
When did you talk much with

32
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,910
Mr Zhou Chuan?

33
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,230
I thought you hate him.

34
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,390
Yes. I hate him.

35
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,190
You don't look like you hate him.

36
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,790
You'll develop affection
for him eventually.

37
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,110
The person I hate

38
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,829
is him in real life.

39
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,270
But I still admire him

40
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,750
as an author.

41
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,390
The colour on this is not off.

42
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,510
We just need to pay attention

43
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,470
to this one and the other small areas.

44
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,030
The rest is okay.

45
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,390
By the way,

46
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,790
what's the readers' reaction to the
pre-sale on our Weibo public page?

47
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,710
Let me check.

48
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,830
While I'm at it, let me see

49
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,290
what kind of exclusive gifts
that they like.

50
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,550
Hello, Miao.

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,620
[Chu Li.]

52
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,940

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,270
Mr Liang, what's wrong?

55
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,790
Chu Li.

56
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,230
Did you post on Weibo this morning

57
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,140
about you visiting the printing house
to do the colour match?

58
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,830
And you even asked the readers
about what they want

59
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,690
as gifts for the Book of Luo He God.

60
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,110
And you even

61
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,190
affectionately tagged Mr Zhou Chuan.

62
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,940
Did you do that?

63
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,790
It's just part of my job.

64
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,950
Besides, it's not that affectionate.

65
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,310
That's not up to you to decide.

66
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,710
Look at the comments on Weibo.

67
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,310
Cocoon has told the public that

68
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,820
you don't allow

69
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,460
the illustrator and the author
to communicate with each other

70
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,470
and are using the power that
you don't have to bully the illustrator.

71
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,300
And when you are updating them
with the progress,

72
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,500
you always try to flaunt

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,260
how intimate you are with the author

74
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,030
and think of him as
your personal property.

75
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,270
Madam Cocoon is affecting
Mr Zhou Chuan's work.

76
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,550
It's my duty to prevent her from

77
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,350
harassing Mr Zhou Chuan.

78
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,510
As for the other accusations,

79
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,910
they are simply not true.

80
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,230
They are nonsense.

81
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,990
Simply not true?

82
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,300
Simply not true?

83
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,460
This Mr Zhou Chuan taking me out

84
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,790
to release some stress

85
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,790
when he was stung by his conscience.

86
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,710
I don't care if you are out

87
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,710
to release stress

88
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,510
or release sexual tension.

89
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,340
But in this critical moment,

90
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,870
nothing can go wrong,

91
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,270
understand?

92
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,310
Look.

93
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,110
Zhou Chuan and Jiang Yu Cheng

94
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,030
are considered as

95
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,750
handsome male authors, right?

96
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,510
A lot of female readers

97
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,030
are not reasonable.

98
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,940
You can't talk sense into them.

99
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,909
They'll think of themselves
as the author's

100
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:00,990
mother,

101
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,100
wife

102
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,150
or even auntie,

103
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,510
right?

104
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,500
If you are too close with the author,

105
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,630
you'll become their imaginary enemy.

106
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,670
Don't worry.

107
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,220
My relationship with both of them

108
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,350
is totally innocent.

109
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,030
Yes.

110
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,620
I totally

111
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,350
believe that you are innocent.

112
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,310
But the thing is, those readers

113
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,550
have to believe it,

114
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,660
right?

115
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,660
So, I called you here today

116
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,920
to give you a reminder.

117
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,230
No matter what they say online,

118
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,070
do not

119
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,750
talk back to them.

120
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,950
Okay.

121
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,310
What do you want to drink?

122
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,310
I'll buy it from the convenience store.

123
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,340
My treat.

124
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,220
By the way,

125
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,750
did anything happen today?

126
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,590
No.

127
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,710
Just some evil fans

128
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,870
and that unprofessional Cocoon.

129
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,390
But I'm not affected by them at all.

130
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,470
The drama that they've started

131
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,150
has become a promotion for the books.

132
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,180
As long as the books can sell,

133
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,230
I don't mind.

134
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,150
By the way,

135
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,220
do you have any idea

136
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,830
on what exclusive gifts to give

137
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,790
for our advanced sale this time?

138
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,910
I thought you'll threaten me to sign

139
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,380
every single book that we sell.

140
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,510
Of course not.

141
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,780
Too many signatures
will decrease its value.

142
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,390
I'm glad you know not to

143
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,650
kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.

144
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,670
Actually, I know that

145
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,190
our fans want an extra volume.

146
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,590
But if we have an official extra volume,

147
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,220
those booksellers will not agree.

148
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,450
What do you think about
main characters' journals?

149
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,630
It's like a summary of

150
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,890
those important events from your novel.

151
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,230
Main characters' journal.

152
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,060
Sounds good.

153
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,390
But let me tell you.

154
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,070
Don't make it too long.

155
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,190
It's going to be

156
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,430
a thin little booklet.

157
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,430
Always remember that

158
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,380
your words are money.

159
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,070
Don't try so hard.

160
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,470
Are you saying that I'm too wordy?

161
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,390
I wouldn't dare.

162
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,470
If those keyboard warriors

163
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,390
knew how you treat me,

164
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,390
they wouldn't have misunderstood.

165
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,110
What?

166
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,310
That Madam Cocoon replied to the readers

167
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,430
insinuating that I am uneducated.

168
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,790
She's the uneducated one.

169
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,670
Don't be mad.

170
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,330
You'll have to buy a new phone
if you break yours.

171
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,950
Who is Fairy Li that
screenshot this for you?

172
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,070
She gossips more than me.

173
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,390
Give it back. I want to see.

174
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,510
I'm furious.

175
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,870
All these years, only Her Highness

176
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,310
in my family can scold me.

177
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,350
How could she scold my mother?

178
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,350
Give it back.

179
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,550
Hurry up.

180
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,830

181
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,150
Focus on taking a walk.

182
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,070
Let's go.

183
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,780

[I would look forward to it.]

199
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,340
Don't look at me so lovingly.

200
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,430
After all,
I'm The Gentle and Kind Mr Chuan.

201
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,390
You...

202
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,790
But I can predict that

203
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,260
the fans are going to attack me again.

204
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,900
But I'm not afraid.

205
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,220
I was afraid that the books
won't get any attention.

206
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,030
Now, everyone will know about

207
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,870
the launching of your new book.

208
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,870
I'm defending you.

209
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,170
How can you just think about the sale?

210
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,190
Boss,

211
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,100
it's your book that I'm selling.

212
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,830
Besides, I've been working so hard lately.

213
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,390
But,

214
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,790
I still have to thank you.

215
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,990
Now,

216
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,710
we can save up on promoting the book.

217
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,710
There's no need to spend money on it.

218
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,860
This is so unfortunate.

219
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,750
I would be even better if

220
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,610
Madam Cocoon did this
during tomorrow's pre-sale.

221
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,390
So unfortunate.

222
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,910
Stop asking for so much.

223
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,430
Go and pay now.

Mr Zhou Chuan is so handsome.

226
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,190
He personally defended you.

[Author Zhou Chuan: My editor is just
communicating with the illustrator...]

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,950
Thus, Cocoon is forced to apologise.

230
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,030
Isn't that great?

231
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,390
If that was true,
I would look forward to it.

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,240
Why are you spacing out?

235
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,870
It's so unfortunate.

236
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,030
I should have tagged

238
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,510

That way,

240
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,520
the book would be in the top search now.

We are going to make
our official announcement this afternoon.

242
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,070
How is it? Have you written the post yet?

243
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,750
I've already checked it multiple times.

244
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,260
Nothing will go wrong.

245
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,780

246

as well as the gifts for the pre-sale.

He has already sent the
main characters' journal to me.

249
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,230
We can print it out anytime.

250
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,350
He even told us that

251
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,110
the first 300 fans who buy his books

252
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,830
will get a free bookmark
with his signature.

different paintings as freebies.

Great.

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,340
Now, they don't need to worry that

260
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,740
they'll buy the version that they dislike.

264
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,790
asking the magazines and departments
under his corporation

265
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,250
to share it and support us.

Mr Xia.

270
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,070

you stayed up all night yesterday.

for many days.

she's like the younger version of you.

286
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,110

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,870
when you were in charge of
Suo Heng's first book,

288
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,150

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,830
My advice is,

301
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,420
don't be too ecstatic yet.

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,750
will gain a worldwide support.

say this to you.

You are talking about marriage?

374
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,589
But at this age,

375
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,470
I'm not planning on getting married yet.

376
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,230
I'm not talking about marriage.

377
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm talking about renting a house.

378
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,069
Weren't you talking about

379
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,530

380
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,109
I just suddenly realised that from now on,

381
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,470
I don't think I'll be able to live alone.

382
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,630

383
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,670
I don't think so.

384
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,710

385
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,640

386
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,780
Chu Li.

387
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,710
How can you like a man

388
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,110
who just lies there and

389
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,870
orders you to cook for him?

390
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,750
We are quite pretty.

391
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,340
When we choose a man,

392
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,190
we have to choose a good man.

393
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,510
You can't simply choose someone.

394
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,470
Nonsense.

395
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,670
I don't

396

397
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,700
My feeling for him

398
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,150
is just simply an admiration.

399
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,830
It's not love.

400
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,970
Your antagonist this time is not bad.

401
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,790
But the protagonist is too weak.

Okay. I'll go there now.

409
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,220
She passed out.

410

411
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,520
this has happened many times already.

412

I didn't even know.

413
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,090
It's quite serious this time.

414

Don't worry.

415
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,050
She'll be fine.

416

I waited outside like this

418
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,350
when my parents passed away.

419
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,910
All these years, Ms Liu is like my mother.

420
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,070
What if she doesn't

421
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,270
wake up?

422
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,630
Don't think too much.

423
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,630
The result is not out yet.

424
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,550
Sit down first. Don't panic.

430
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,750

432
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,470
I'm too shocked to order food delivery.

No.

[and told him that]

555
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,310
[I might move out.]

556
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,630
[It's not that my stay here is upsetting.]

557
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,190
[I just feel that
it's inappropriate for me]

558
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,510
[to continue to stay here.]

559
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,270
[Actually, my landlord is quite nice.]

560
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,950
[He asked me to cook, walk his dog]

561
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,940
[and clean the place.]

562
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,870
[But he let me stay for free and
bought me new furniture.]

563
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,900
[Did you save the galaxy
in your previous life?]

564
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,350
[Why do you still want to move out then?]

565
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:08,470
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

566
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,980
[Do you have a conscience?]

567
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,390
[I'm not asking you to lecture me.]

568
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,350
[Maybe there's only one reason]

569
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,240
[that caused him to be so mad.]

570
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,120
[Maybe he doesn't want you to move out]

571
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,070
[because of some reasons.]

572
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,940
[To be honest,]

573
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,150
[I don't want to move out.]

574
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,190
[But why don't I want to move out?]

575
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,350
Why do you keep staring at me?

576
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,150
You are affecting my mood to eat.

577
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,390
When I cooked, you did...

578
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,910
Forget it.

579
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,300
What do you mean?

580
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,110
[Fine. Since it's me]

581
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,190
[who can't bear to leave you.]

582
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,070
Doctor.

583
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,710
How is she now?

584
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,630
The patient is stable now.

585
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,470
She's no longer in critical condition.

586
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,670
But you have to be careful

587
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,500
not to aggravate her.

588
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,550
-Okay.
-Okay.

589
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,390
Thank you, doctor.

590
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,550
You are welcome.

591
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,080
Yun Fei, let me send you home first.

592
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,140
It's okay.

593
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,870

594
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,750

596
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,670
I'll get going now.

597
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,270
Thank you for today.

598
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,190
I came for Ms Liu.

599
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,470
Bai Zhi.

600
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,580
Xiao Jiang.

601
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,870
You are here.

602
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,990
How do you feel now?

603
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,650
Do you feel painful anywhere?

604
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,290
You scared me to death.

605
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,390
Silly kid.

606
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,590
Everyone has to go through

607
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,620
birth, death, illness and old age.

608
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,350
You are not allowed to say that.

609
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,510
You are the one

610
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,540
whom I worry the most.

611
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,510
Xiao Jiang.

612
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,750
You

613
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,230
have to take good care of Bai Zhi.

614
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,830
Since high school, she has

615
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,670
lost both of her parents.

616
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,030
So, she likes to take care of
everything by herself.

617
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,670
She's very competitive.

618
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,630
If she did something that upset you,

619
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,180
please be understanding.

620
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,830
Now,

621
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,350
I'll hand her over to you.

622
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,670
From now on,

623
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,750
you have to take good care of her.

624
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,350
Can you promise me that?

625
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,760
[Chu Li]

626
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,430
Hello, Chu Li.

627
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,560
[Corner Bookstore]

628
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,390
I'm sorry, Mr Jiang.

629
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,700
I've been too busy with
the Book of Luo He God lately.

630
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,750
That's why we can only do this at night.

631
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,340
You won't blame me, right?

632
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,150
Mr Jiang.

633
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,460
I'm sorry. What did you say just now?

634
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,270
It's better if we don't check the script

635
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,420
when something is on your mind.

636
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,590
Or else, it'll be easy to make a mistake.

637
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,750
Mr Jiang.

638
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,390
What's wrong?

639
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,390
If

640
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,000
you have a past that you want to forget,

641
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,150
what will you do?

642
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,910
Me?

643
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,310
Why would I want to forget about my past?

644
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,950
I am who I am today because of

645
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,590
what happened in the past.

646
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,350
If I want to forget about my past,

647
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,590
it means that I'm denying myself now.

648
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,780
My mother once told me that

649
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,790
even if something bad happened,

650
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,790
we have to look at the bright side of it.

651
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,590
Actually, when I first came to
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

652
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,870
it was so stressful.

653
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,030
I was suddenly in charge of

654
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,230
two top authors, you and Zhou Chuan.

655
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,350
Everyone was looking forward
to my performance

656
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,110
and some were waiting for my downfall.

657
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,830
But, these stresses are my motivations.

658
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,070
Because of them, I grew up faster.

659
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,070
I had gained new experience.

660
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,110
Besides, I think that
I'm very fortunate to be able to

661
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,430
handle both of your books for you.

662
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,230
Because I'm doing what I like.

663
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,460
Mr Jiang,

664
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,070
I don't know what past that

665
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,310
you want to forget.

666
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,150
But you have to thank your past.

667
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,630
Because of it,

668
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,290
you are who you are right now.
Like a phoenix rising from its ashes.

669
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,530
Like a phoenix rising from its ashes?

670
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,510
What doesn't kill you

671
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,270
will make you even stronger.

672
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,110
Another thing, Mr Jiang.

673
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,550
If you want to forget about something,

674
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,030
every time you think about it,

675
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,710
you'll only remember it more.

676
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,310
So, the best way

677
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,750
is to face it calmly.

678
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,270
You are right, Chu Li.

679
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,420
Thank you.

680
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,150
You are welcome.

681
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,470
Consulting a lost author

682
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,700
is also part of my job as the editor.

683
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,830

690
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,560

being able to see
the number of copies being sold live

00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,710
is too much

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,150
for an old man like me.

698
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,610

"I don't think that I've been

00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,510
I am...

739
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,910
Are you crying out of happiness
or are you sad?

740
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,670
I want to say that

741
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,550
if it's possible,

742
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,070
can I become the person

743
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,070
that you mentioned in your Weibo...

744
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,070
Who is it?

745
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,750
What did you say just now?

746
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,110
Check the sale for me.

747
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,190
Who is it?

748
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,630
Now is not the time.

749
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,570
This is bad.

750
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,390
What's wrong?

751
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,070
Jiang Yu Cheng.

752
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,870
Why are you hiding here?

753
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,350
You have your own room.

754
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,910
Hide inside your room.

755
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,350
Close the door tightly.

756
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,310
Don't come out no matter what you hear.

757
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,670
What would I hear?

758
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,950
Are you going to do some crimes

759
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,150
or something despicable with Mr Jiang?

760
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,540
Are you going to hide or not?

761
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,230
I...

762
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,180
No.

763
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,390
Why should I hide?

764
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,870
I'm your editor.

765
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,630
I'm just here to check the sale
of your new book

766
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,070
and get some updates from you.

767
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,590
How can I be so smart?

768
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,630
You are wearing like this
in my home to check the sale?

769
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,830
You should just tell Jiang Yu Cheng that

770
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,870
we are already married

771
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,870
and have a son, a daughter and a dog.

772
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,350
Zhou Chuan.

773
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,590
Zhou Chuan.

774
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,270
Aren't you going to add Mr now?

775
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,550
You just call me by my name.

776
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,670
Don't think that you can be so arrogant

777
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,550
just because you sold my books for me.

778
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,380
You really didn't hear
what I said just now?

779
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,550
Zhou Chuan.

780
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,880
Where are the slippers?

781
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,310
The third shelf.

782
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,110
Mine are in the first shelf.

783
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,310
Don't let him find out.

784
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,150
Okay.

785
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,630
Jiang Yu Cheng!

786
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,110
Why are you going through
my shoes cabinet?

787
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,940
I'm in pain.

788
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,730
Give me a pair of slippers.

789
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,950
I'm in pain.

790
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,150
So much pain.

791
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,990
Zhou Chuan.

792
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,990
Your toilet is out of toilet paper.

793
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,230
Use your hand!

794
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,230
I...

795
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,020
The doorbell was too loud just now.

796
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,420
What did you say just now?

797
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,350
Actually, it's not that important.

798
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,110
How's the sale?

799
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,750
It's more than 50,000 now.

800
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,700
Thank you.

801
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,870
You really did well.

802
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,550
Looks like you were

803
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,950
not bragging in the movie theatre
that day.

804
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,910
You really have nothing to say to me?

805
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,590
I'll tell you again
when the time is right.

806
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,390
I'm too impatient this time.

807
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,110
Now, I'm even more curious.

808
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,270
Bye.

Zhou Chuan.

812
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,590
Why is it taking you so long
to find a toilet paper?

813
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,270
Wait.

814
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,670
I have to find it.

815
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,790
Isn't this your home?

816
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,320
Why is it taking you so long?

00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,900
How many copies did you sell?

825
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,910
Not bad.

826
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,070
Around 60,000.

827
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,670
Not bad.

828
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,710
Don't be humble.

829
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,510
Let's open up another can.

830
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,630
Enough. That'll be the last for you.

831
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,560
Or else, I'll have to drag you home.

832
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,860
Who said that I'm going home?

833
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,550
Can't I sleep on your bed?

834
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,430
Listen.

835
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,260
Your sale is going to

836
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,790
hit 350,000 soon.

837
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,510
I'm sure you can afford to
give me a shirt, right?

838
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,910
Yes.

839
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,510
But I can only sell 340,000 copies.

840
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,510
Why?

841
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,870
If I hit 350,000, no one will cook for me.

842
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,950
What logic is that?

843
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,510
Are you drunk?

844
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,890
Go and choose the shirt yourself.

845
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,200
Where are your sleeping pants?

846
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,990
Don't change here.

847
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,920
Go to the toilet.

848
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,060
How long do I have to wait?

849
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,150
Hide properly.

850
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,470
Zhou Chuan.

851
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,070
I think this pair of pants

852
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,350
is too long for me.

853
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,430
You...

854
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,490
Go out first,
I'll get another one for you later.

855
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,550
Don't come in again.

856
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,590
Stop it.

00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,060
Be good. I'll buy can food
for you next time.

858

Wake up, I'm not Er Gou.

859
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,150
I'll shave you if you move again.

860
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,670
Er Gou is so pitiful.

861
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,390
You even torture it in your sleep.

862
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,350
You...

863
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,590
What are you doing?

864
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,910
What can I do?

865
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,150
You were so naughty last night.

866
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,590
I couldn't even sleep well.

867
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,470
Mr Zhou Chuan, do you remember

868
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,630
what you promised me

869
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,180
last night?

870
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,590
Did I promise to marry you?

871
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,550
Don't believe it.

872
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,350
Don't worry.

873
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,270
Nothing happened.

874
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,590
Congratulations.
Your virginity is still intact.

875
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,470
Last night, you drank, you ate

876
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,710
and had fun with Mr Jiang

877
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,830
until you forgot about me.

878
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,110
Do you still remember?

879
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,990
Both of you really have
no tolerance for alcohol.

880
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,990
Don't drink if you can't drink.

881
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,030
Who are you talking about?

882
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,290
It's Jiang Yu Cheng who has no tolerance.

883
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,350
Your friend, Mr Jiang Yu Cheng,

884
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,620
is standing outside the door now.

885
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,030
Yes, it's me.

886
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,490
I'm not your imagination.

887
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,230
In order to avoid more misunderstanding

888
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,830
and more colourful imagination,

889
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,830
can you

890
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,460
open this magical door right now?
