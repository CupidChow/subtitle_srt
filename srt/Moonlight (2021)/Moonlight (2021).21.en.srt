00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,910
Did you ask me here today

5
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,520
to share your fangirling experience
with me?

6
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,710
Of course not.

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,430
I just want to share my past with you.

8
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,270
When I just joined
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

9
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,180
I told a little lie.

10
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,270
I said,

11
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,910
being a great editor

12
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,670
had been my dream since young.

13
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,110
In fact,

14
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,190
when I first learnt

15
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,030
about editor,

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,030
I was in a literature class

17
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,180
in the university.

18
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,259
Back then, I learnt

19
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,460
that besides being a writer,

20
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,030
a good editor

21
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,110
could also bring great works
to the people.

22
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,150
That time,

23
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,590
I wanted to show them these.

24
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,020
But on a second thought,

25
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,900
I changed my mind.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,990
Why don't I wait for a little while?

27
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,470
One day,

28
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,710
when I become the editor
of Yuan Yue Publishing House,

29
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,230
I can always dig these out.

30
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,550
If you still wish to...

31
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,910
No, I don't.

32
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,180
It takes talent to be a great writer.

33
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,990
I don't have that kind of talent.

34
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,260
Besides,

35
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,310
today,

36
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,310
if I were just an ordinary writer,

37
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,790
I wouldn't have bonded

38
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,230
with all of you.

39
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,390
I'm very lucky

40
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,350
to be your editor.

41
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,950
I'm also very lucky

42
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,950
to be able meet someone like you,
who is...

43
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,280
What are you guys doing?

44
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,750
They're coming, they're coming. Run!

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,940
Stand there!

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,860
♫ Daydreams chasing the nightdreams ♫

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,110
♫ I chase you
all the way to the universe ♫

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,090
♫ Be a good baby if you want to
live in the splendid castle ♫

49
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,430
♫ It's not like this ♫

50
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,280
♫ Oh, waiting for your signal, hello ♫

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,820
♫ My cutie is here ♫

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,720
♫ We have a date online and offline ♫

53
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,210
♫ Ding ding ding, my cutie is here ♫

54
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,660
♫ I fell in love with a mischief-maker ♫

55
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,910
Where have they gone?

56
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,850
They're not here. Where are they?

57
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,190
Where have they gone?

58
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,310
Let's go.

59
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,150
Did they lock it?

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,829
I think they did.

61
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,550
Security, are you still out there?

62
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,390
We're locked in here!

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,750
-Is anyone out there?
-I'll make a call.

64
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,510
There's no signal.

65
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,220
Not even the slightest signal.

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,269
Help!

67
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,870
There are two people in here!

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,750
Are we going

69
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,100
to be locked up in here forever?

70
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,870
Of course not.

71
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,630
When your mum notices
that you're not home tonight,

72
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,790
she'll look for you.

73
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,870
It's just that it might take some time.

74
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,270
If Her Highness learns about this,

75
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,590
she will definitely kill me.

76
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,110
Are you going on a picnic
with this package?

77
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,870
I wanted to eat them tonight

78
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,270
while playing with fireworks.

79
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,270
Fireworks?

80
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,150
I bought fireworks,

81
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,940
I wanted to play these with you.

82
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,230
Sparkler?

83
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,150
When I was young,
the moment I anticipated the most

84
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,590
was the time after dinner,

85
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,310
when a bunch of kids sat in the yard,

86
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,190
waiting to play with fireworks.

87
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,950
I was the person who set off fireworks.

88
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,940
But fireworks are not easy to get now.

89
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,190
Lunar New Year isn't as exciting
as when I was a child.

90
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,909
I guess Lunar New Year hasn't changed,

91
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,030
instead,

92
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,500
we've grown up.

93
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,310
Maybe.

94
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,950
Frankly speaking,

95
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,590
I actually wish to go back to being a kid.

96
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,150
You know what?

97
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,310
Playing with fireworks
just feels so great.

98
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,630
The sparks move slowly.

99
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,070
Then, whoosh.

100
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,150
It shoots into the sky.

101
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,490
At that time, I'd think to myself,

102
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,190
the fireworks is glorious,

103
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,110
it was me who set it off.

104
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,190
It feels just like

105
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,670
seeing my own name

106
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,950
on Book of Luo He God.

107
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,240
There's so much sense of accomplishment,
so much pride.

108
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,510
Shouldn't the person

109
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,030
who invented fireworks feel proud instead?

110
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,950
The person who invented fireworks

111
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,470
created beauty and happiness.

112
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,590
The person who sets off fireworks

113
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,830
brought the beauty and happiness
to the night sky

114
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,470
and the people.

115
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,110
I've been working in this industry
for almost 30 years,

116
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,110
but I've never seen anyone like you,

117
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,150
digging tree on Lunar New Year

118
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,630
and went in after that.

119
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,710
You even triggered my smoke alarm!

120
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,710
Do you want me to call your parents?

121
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,320
Eat something first before you sleep.

122
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,310
I'll do it.

123
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,870
I...

124
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,190
I'll answer the call first.

125
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,630
Yun Fei.

126
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,510
[Ms Gu,]

127
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,950
[finally you answered my call.]

128
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,210
[I called you several times yesterday.]

129
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,990
Something came up yesterday,
I missed your calls.

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,429
[What happened?]

131
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,159
[Is there anything I can help?]

132
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,760
Everything's fine now.

133
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,820
[Great to hear that.]

134
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,110
[I just want to give you
my new year's greetings.]

135
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,100
[Ms Gu, happy Lunar New Year.]

136
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,630
Happy Lunar New Year.

137
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,470
Was that Yun Fei?

138
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,290
He was greeting me.

139
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,270
Thank you.

140
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,430
You came here
on the first day of Lunar New Year.

141
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,030
You didn't even get
to enjoy the celebrations.

142
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,820
When I saw that you came,

143
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,430
I was rather surprised.

144
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,230
I...

145
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,510
If you wanted to say

146
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,910
that you'd do this for anyone,

147
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,350
just save it.

148
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,110
I don't do this for everyone.

149
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,870
There.

150
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,110
Are you done?

151
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,380
I'll leave the food here.
Remember to take your medicine.

152
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,020
Mr Zhou Chuan,

153
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,550
today is the fourth day of Lunar New Year.

154
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,150
You've been out for three days,

155
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,110
are you not going home?

156
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,710
Why do I feel like
you keep asking me to leave?

157
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,230
Are you going on a blind date later?

158
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,310
No way.

159
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,870
I'm worried
that your parents will be angry with you.

160
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,630
Don't worry.

161
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,190
I'm going home tonight.

162
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,300
I'll go back to Shanghai tomorrow morning

163
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,710
to pick Er Gou up.

164
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,750
And you?

165
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,580
When are you coming back?

166
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,710
When do you want me to go back?

167
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,670
The sooner, the better.

168
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,870
Do you expect Er Gou and me
to live on air?

169
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,800
Alright, then.

170
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,460
I'm taking the train
the day after tomorrow.

171
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,550
But I can change it to tomorrow.

172
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,830
♫ I want to hide like a kid
who made mistakes ♫

173
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,670
Okay.
I'll pick you up at the train station.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,530
♫ My heart skipped a beat ♫

175
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,940
[Mr Wang]

176
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,670
[Hi, Mr Zhou Chuan,]

177
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,750
[the items you ordered have arrived.]

178
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,260
♫ When you look at me
everything seems so cute ♫

179
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,030
Come with me.

180
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,910
I'll take you somewhere fun.

181
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,030
Come.

182
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,750
Where are you taking me?

183
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,790
Why do you ask so many questions?

184
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,990
Give me your hand.

185
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,090
♫ It's not that I'm resentful ♫

186
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,050
♫ It's not that I'm unreasonable ♫

187
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:25,570
♫ It's just like Sahara meeting Paris ♫

188
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,190
You...

189
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,390
What?

190
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,050
♫ I searched everywhere for a motive ♫

191
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,290
♫ I am my new imaginary enemy ♫

192
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,450
♫ I'm sulking for no reason ♫

193
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,280
♫ If we can meet again someday ♫

194
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,330
♫ On a romantic rainy day, in the street ♫

195
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,490
♫ May I share my cosy coat with you? ♫

196
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,220
Why are you staring at me?

197
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,210
♫ I'll try to be casual ♫

198
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,340
♫ While showing you the surprises
I have for you ♫

199
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,310
Fireworks.

200
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,810
♫ You're welcome ♫

201
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,070
♫ This is your galaxy ♫

202
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,310
Give me that.

203
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,320
♫ Just like in the summer ♫

204
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,700
♫ The whistle blown away by the breeze ♫

205
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,860
♫ Every picture in my mind
is about you ♫

206
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,270
♫ If you look into my eyes ♫

207
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,710
♫ You will feel the same ♫

208
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:26,090
♫ Just give me a cue as an encouragement ♫

209
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:37,070
♫ We might end up together ♫

210
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,950
It's gorgeous.

211
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,830
Are you happy?

212
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,830
I'm happy.

213
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,390
This is the best new year gift

214
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,590
I've ever received this year.

215
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,950
There's something else.

216
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,830
Hang on.

217
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,670
This is...

218
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,710
This is the first manuscript I wrote.

219
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,230
I want to give it to you.

220
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,030
Read it whenever you want.

221
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,110
I wanted to read this manuscript

222
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,070
not because of curiosity.

223
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,430
I just wanted to know

224
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,070
what made you

225
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,110
start writing back then.

226
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,950
The thoughts and the world

227
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,330
which you wanted to show to the world.

228
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,030
Because I believe

229
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,350
when something is able

230
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,150
to motivate a writer for several years,

231
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,590
the readers will be moved as well.

232
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,670
Mr Zhou Chuan,

233
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,350
thank you

234
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,950
for sharing this with me.

235
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,780
However,

236
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,270
if this is something

237
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,590
which you do not wish to recall,

238
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,790
I will help you get over it.

239
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,470
Hand in hand,

240
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,610
we will head somewhere with light
in the future.

241
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,670
Somewhere with light.

242
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,140
Then we'll face it together.

243
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,060
Because I said,

244
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,330
I was captivated by the light.

245
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,310
Hello, mum.

246
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,140
Okay, okay.

247
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,900
I'll come home now.

248
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,390
Sorry.

249
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,830
My... My mum is asking me to go home.

250
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,270
I'll send you home.

251
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,990
This is me.

252
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,830
You should go back.

253
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,510
Go in.

254
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,550
I'm going in.

255
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,230
Hold on.

256
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,360
See you in Shanghai.

257
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,410
[Little Monkey]

258
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,670
[Mr Zhou Chuan, I'm home.]

259
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,390
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

260
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,230
[I'll leave now.]

261
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,220
[Mr Zhou Chuan, look up.]

262
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,079
[Little Monkey]

263
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,270
[Little Monkey]

264
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,310
[The moon is beautiful tonight.]

265
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,150
[Little Monkey]

266
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,830
[Mr Zhou Chuan, are you still there?]

267
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,430
[Little Monkey]

268
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,110
[If you're still there,]

269
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,710
[just send me something.]

270
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,110
[Even just a punctuation.]

271
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:29,660
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

272
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,860
Full stop?

273
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,150
What does this mean?

274
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,150
Alright,

275
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,190
I got it?

276
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,710
Stop messing around?

277
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,550
Natsume Soseki.

278
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,150
What about Natsume Soseki?

279
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,430
Where's his literature quality?

280
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,910
[Go to sleep. Good night.]

281
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,560
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

282
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,460
[Good night.]

283
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,460
[Chu Li]

284
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,390
Does he not get it

285
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,670
or

286
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,030
is he rejecting me?

287
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,310
Does a full stop mean

288
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,910
we are over?

289
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,390
Tense neck?

290
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,910
Put this on.

291
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,960
You'll feel better.

292
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,870
Sure.

293
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,510
The food is ready.

294
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,590
Come eat.

295
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,810
I want to eat something spicy.

296
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,790
No, you can only eat congee.

297
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,270
I'm going back to the book store
in the afternoon,

298
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,470
we'll be open soon.

299
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,070
That's early.

300
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,710
It's the fifth day
of Lunar New Year today.

301
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,350
Really?

302
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,270
Have I been staying here for so long?

303
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,750
You slept on the sofa for so many days,

304
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,110
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,830
It takes another week for gastroenteritis
to be fully recovered.

306
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,150
Don't go home
and eat any takeaway you like.

307
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,190
Don't order any spicy food
when I'm not around.

308
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,110
I...

309
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,550
Hello, Tang.

310
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,910
What?

311
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,950
I'll be right there.

312
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,270
I have to go to the office.

313
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,870
Eat the congee first.

314
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,270
Eat it.

315
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,470
I'll take you there after you finish it.

316
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,830
Good morning, Director Gu.

317
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,830
Mr Luo.

318
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,320
Has Yun Fei's book been released earlier?

319
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,550
Yes.

320
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,610
What's the matter?

321
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,310
Neither I nor Yun Fei

322
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,030
heard anything about this.

323
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,430
You made this decision
before Lunar New Year, didn't you?

324
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,670
I knew you wouldn't have agreed

325
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,190
even if I had told you.

326
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,790
Why bother doing that?

327
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,220
You're right.

328
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,870
To release an instalment,

329
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,470
it takes a lot of work.

330
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,740
We haven't published

331
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,750
the ending of the second chapter online,

332
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,550
because it's not organised yet.

333
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,590
Please give me more time.

334
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,660
This story will get so much better.

335
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,300
We do not have so much time

336
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,430
to wait for a writer to brush up his work.

337
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,630
What if he takes several years?

338
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,710
Releasing at the beginning
of a year before anyone else

339
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,070
will make a great start.

340
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,750
This is the best strategy

341
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,750
for Xin Dun Books.

342
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,470
Yun Fei is a promising writer.

343
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,230
I wanted to release his book

344
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,390
at the same time
as Jiang Yu Cheng's new book.

345
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,390
In that case,

346
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,550
we can take this advantage to promote it.

347
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,100
It will build up momentum.

348
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,670
Jiang Yu Cheng?

349
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,710
His book release will be postponed.

350
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,270
Instead,
two cosplayers beat him to the draw.

351
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,390
Cosplayers?

352
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,230
Why?

353
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,790
Who knows?

354
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,590
If everything goes well,

355
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,450
the announcement will be made
after Lunar New Year.

356
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,070
Besides,

357
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,230
getting an advantage
is the style of Xin Dun Books.

358
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,990
If you think this is not right,

359
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,450
maybe you're not suitable
for Xin Dun Books.

360
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,910
Although we managed
to recruit Maurer last year,

361
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,220
don't you forget

362
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,670
that you messed up several times

363
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,830
with Zhou Chuan and Jiang Yu Cheng.

364
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,310
If I hadn't backed you up

365
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,950
in the last board meeting,

366
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,990
would you still be Director Gu?

367
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,830
Think it over.

368
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,510
Bei,

369
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,290
does Director Lu have
any filming coming up?

370
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,390
[I'm home. What time will you get here?]

371
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:13,250
[Zhou Chuan]

372
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,680
[Are you awake?]

373
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,230

398
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,020
Yeah.

can't be compared to my confession.

401

I set off fireworks for her
on the rooftop.

402
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,910
Isn't a sky full of fireworks

408
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,140
Let me ask you something.

409
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,630
Did you tell her

410
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,490
the girls' most favourite words?

411
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,750

No.

415
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,860
When we actually do it

416
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,790
it'd sound really tacky.

417

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,030
that Mr Zhou Chuan has a girlfriend.

560
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,790
This is his personal business,

561
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,989
I shouldn't ask him anything.

562
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,250
I guess some of his fans
will be heartbroken.

563
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,390
I have a good news for you.

564
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,180
What is it?

565
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,070
We've received the feedback
for the latest issue of Moonlight.

566
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,550
Suo Heng's Little Deity

567
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,790
is the hottest topic on Moonlight now.

568
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,230
Besides, it ranked the first

569
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,430
in the monthly
most anticipated novel ranking

570
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,030
initiated by Yuan Yue's official website.

571
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,870
Oh, God!

572
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,900
This is the best news for new year!

573
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,030
Exactly.

574
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,990
Besides, Mr Xia has discussed with Mr Yang

575
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,590
whether or not to let Suo Heng stay.

576
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,590
Mr Yang has agreed to let her stay.

577
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,950
Then, will the comic section

578
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,460
be put aside?

579
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,390
Of course.

580
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,780
The sections on Moonlight

581
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,390
are only reserved for great work.

582
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,940
Mr Liang will be pissed off.

583
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,960
That is for sure.

584
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,280
Let's go.

585
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,830
Mr Liang,

586
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,870
look at this.

587
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,830
It's a new year,

588
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,790
but there's not a good start.

589
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,230
Suo Heng will publish her work,

590
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,070
but the comic section will be removed.

591
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,950
We added comic section

592
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,630
just to increase the sales of Moonlight.

593
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,070
But after what they've done,

594
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,740
I...

595
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,350
I've made a deal

596
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,990
with those two cosplayers.

597
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,710
What should I tell them now?

598
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,270
It's hot, huh?

599
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,230
It's hot.

600
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,070
Look.

601
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,670
You've always been so impatient.

602
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,390
It wasn't even confirmed yet,

603
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,190
why did you make a deal with them?

604
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,150
Anyway, rest assured.

605
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,350
Although they can't publish the comic
on Moonlight,

606
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,430
they can always publish a book.

607
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,710
Are you saying...

608
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,030
Think about it.

609
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,310
Another book will be released

610
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,110
at the same time with Jiang Yu Cheng.

611
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,190
Now this is a competition

612
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,030
between Yue Yue and Xin Dun.

613
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,750
How can a has-been shoulder our sales?

614
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,390
Would the top management be so careless?

615
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,140
You're right.

616
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,110
I get it now, Mr Liang.

617
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,030
I'll talk

618
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,710
to the cosplayers

619
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,350
about the details
of their autobiographies.

620
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,150
Miao,

621
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,670
listen to my advice.

622
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,630
You

623
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,540
should give your strength full play.

624
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,270
Stay calm when a problem arises.

625
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,510
Don't panic,

626
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,640
don't get agitated.

627
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,230
They're a has-been

628
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,950
and a rookie,

629
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,150
they have no influence.

630
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,510
You...

631
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,750
I get it now, I get it now.

632
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,670
Mr Jiang,

633
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,510
don't worry.

634
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,550
You will make a great comeback.

635
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,950
Great.

636
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,610
I heard you and Zhou Chuan
are seeing each other.

637
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,750
You knew.

638
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,750
Yeah.

639
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,630
That guy has always been thoughtless,

640
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,630
if he pisses you off,

641
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,310
just give him the long face.

642
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,860
I will.

643
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,110
What were you guys talking about?
You seem happy.

644
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,630
Why should I let you know
our conversation?

645
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,070
Don't you forget that she is mine now.

646
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,430
Why did I hear the voice of Gu Bai Zhi

647
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,670
when I called you the other day?

648
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,830
Director Gu and you...

649
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,310
They've broken up,

650
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,950
but they haven't moved on.

651
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,740
How's that?

652
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,070
You're glad that you chose me, aren't you?

653
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,430
That's not it.

654
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,070
She was sick during Lunar New Year.

655
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,780
I took care of her.

656
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,910
Now I get it.

657
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,860
My mum asked me

658
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
if you went back to Shanghai with me.

659
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,940
Right after I left
on the first day of Lunar New Year,

660
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,140
you rushed back home

661
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,230
just because she was sick.

662
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,870
You also went to Zhejiang

663
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,270
just because Chu Li changed her clothes.

664
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,270
I...

665
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,430
Mr Zhou Chuan.

666
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,190
Shut the hell up.

667
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,600
Let's go home and cook. Come on.

668
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,510
Is it nice?

669
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,510
It's nice,

670
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,110
but I think the ending will be terrible.

671
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,380
Based on internet sources,

672
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,430
Yun Fei doesn't know anything
about early publication

673
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,950
of the second book.

674
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,350
Tens of thousands of comments

675
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,810
are scolding Gu Bai Zhi
under her Weibo post.

676
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,390
What does this have to do with Gu Bai Zhi?

677
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,150
We never know.

678
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,820
She always puts business first.

679
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,030
However, this is the reason why

680
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,550
she's the one
who could see Yun Fei's potential.

681
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,660
I bet she won't do anything bad

682
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,590
to Yun Fei right now.

683
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,940
Stop reading.

684
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,870
You got off work. Don't think about work.

685
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,630
Come. Walk Er Gou with me.

686
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,990
But the extra edition...

687
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,670
Read it after we come back.

688
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,510
Chu Li,

689
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,910
listen.

690
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,470
Mr Zhou Chuan's love letter

691
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,870
has been forwarded
hundreds of thousands times.

692
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,940
Look.

693
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,870
The comments said

694
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,390
The Gentle and Kind Mr Chuan

695
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,470
will break so many hearts
when he gets romantic.

696
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,670
A guy like him

697
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,230
will win over any girl he likes.

698
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,710
What kind of person

699
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,780
do you think Mr Zhou Chuan likes?

700
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,150
Chu Li!

701
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,110
What did you say? I wasn't listening.

702
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,710
I was talking about Mr Zhou Chuan.

703
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,030
Why does your laugh

704
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,310
seem so creepy?

705
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,070
Really?

706
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,990
It's nothing.

707
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,380
I just think

708
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,870
that dating isn't a bad thing.

709
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,390
When a guy is dating someone,

710
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,510
he will be more mature.

711
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,110
In that case, he won't give

712
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,590
the editor or art editor a hard time

713
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,510
with his stupid ideas.

714
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,830
Am I right?

715
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,550
No.

716
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,860
I have an evil thought though.

717
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,430
I hope that Mr Zhou Chuan

718
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,140
will break up after one week.

719
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,310
In that case,

720
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,990
he will belong to Chuan's fans club.

721
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,110
You know what?

722
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,570
He lost a lot of readers
after making his relationship public.

723
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,510
I have an announcement to make.

724
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,590
A new colleague

725
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,710
will be joining Yuan Yue Publishing House.

726
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,030
Hi, I'm Zhou Chuan.

727
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,230
I look forward to working with you.

728
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,580
Mr Zhou Chuan's new instalment

729
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,550
is related to editors,

730
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,110
he purposely came to Moonlight Magazine

731
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,510
to gain some experience.

732
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,470
Chu Li,

733
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,270
take him

734
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,550
to get familiar with the environment.

735
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,110
Sure, sure.

736
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,510
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

737
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,270
You didn't even say anything.

738
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,390
I didn't tell you

739
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,950
so that I can give you a surprise.

740
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,150
Are you

741
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,070
not happy?

742
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,550
No.

743
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,140
I was thinking, we can always meet

744
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,750
after work.

745
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,630
Is this because

746
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,030
you miss me so badly

747
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,420
that you have to find an excuse to see me?

748
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,620
You think too much.

749
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,870
I'm preparing

750
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,590
for a modern fantasy novel
related to editors.

751
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,270
Modern fantasy novel?

752
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,870
It doesn't seem legit.

753
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,150
Do you have doubts with my creativity?

754
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,310
Let's drop the new instalments.

755
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,670
No, no!

756
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,070
I was just fooling around.

757
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,390
You're here to gain experience,

758
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,590
you have my full support.

759
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,030
That's more like it.

760
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,880
Then, in the future,

761
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,630
in order to save you some trouble,

762
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,230
since you're here to gain experience,

763
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,310
it is better

764
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,870
if we keep our distance.

765
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,230
If someone knows that we're dating,

766
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,060
people will say
that you're dating your colleague,

767
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,350
your professional image will be affected.

768
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,460
Fine.

769
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,750
So, as not to affect
your professional image as well.

770
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,660
I agree.

771
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,590
When we're in the meeting,

772
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,710
we should sit further from each other.

773
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,510
Keep our distance.

774
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,910
Alright.

775
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,550
However,

776
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,950
since I listen to you,

777
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,310
shouldn't you do something in return?

778
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,390
What should I do?

779
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,310
No.

780
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,550
There are so many people here,

781
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,830
what if they see us?

782
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,500
Then I'll take my words back.

783
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,670
Hurry up. Let's go.
