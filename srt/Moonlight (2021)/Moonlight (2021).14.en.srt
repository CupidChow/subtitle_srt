00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,630
Good night.

00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,470
Do

6
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,110
you like me?

7
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,710
How can I possibly like you?

8
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,470
I don't even think of you as a woman.

9
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,030
Why are you doing this then?

10
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,070
Don't tell me that to you,

11
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,910
I am the same as Er Gou.

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,350
That's right, you are

13
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,190
no different from Er Gou to me.

14
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,950
Why did you come out?

15
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,550
That was scary.

16
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,270
Luckily, I was sharp.

17
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,140
I am like Er Gou to him?

18
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,950
Will Er Gou clean his house, make dinner,

19
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,680
or read his manuscript for him?

20
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,510
What was I thinking?

21
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,070
I actually thought that he liked me.

Did you put a tracker on me?

You are everywhere.

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,140
I am everywhere?

35
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,340
You are letting a girl carrying
so many stuff by herself.

36
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,190
Shouldn't you get yourself checked to see

37
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,510
if there is something
wrong with your body?

By the way, don't forget the...

42
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,190
So, it's your stuff.

43
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,150
I thought it's Chu Li's.

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,110
It's mine indeed.

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,950
What is hers is mine.

46
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,870
She is mine too.

47
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,510
I mean she is my editor.

48
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,550
So, you do know that she is your editor,

49
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,909
not your maid.

50
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,190

Jiang Yu Cheng is here.

75
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,550
Aren't he on bad terms

76
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,020
with Gu Bai Zhi?

77
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,110
Why is he still attending
our Xin Dun Books' event?

78
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,310
I thought you weren't coming.

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,350
That's old love.

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,350
Hello, Mr Jiang.

82
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,260
Hello.

83
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,470
Hold on.

84
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,430
I need to go the airport now.

85
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,150
When I return from France,

86
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,630
I want to talk to you.

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,470
We will see.

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,350
Bai Zhi.

89
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,590
I'd better get going.

90
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,190
Talk to other experienced
writers and learn from them.

91
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,350
Don't mess it up.

92
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,750
Don't worry.

93
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,390
When you return,

94
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,190
I will pick you up at the airport.

95
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,230
Focus on your book.

96
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,390
Let's talk inside, come on.

97
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,390
Let's go.

98
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,430
I heard that Yuan Yue Publishing House
is holding

99
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,950
some kind of
interactive cultural festival.

100
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,750
Isn't that some outdated stuff?

101
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,710
Exactly.

102
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,470
Gu Bai Zhi is working for Xin Dun Books.

103
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,330
I have a friend who really
wants to get signed to her.

104
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,710
Is your friend man or woman?

105
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,790
Woman.

106
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,150
Woman? It's not going to happen.

107
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,790
Let me tell you, Gu Bai Zhi
only signs male writer,

108
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,430
especially young and handsome man.

109
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,150
No way.

110
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,909
Seriously?

111
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,870
Seriously.

112
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,430
You know Yun Fei, right?

113
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,510
She made him famous.

114
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,750
I heard that

115
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,950
they are secretly dating now.

116
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,670
That's why she is working
so hard to make him famous.

117
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,270
Her parachute appointment
in Xin Dun Books,

118
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,590
do you know anything about it?

119
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,030
I do know a little bit about it.

120
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,490
Their company has
a president surnamed Luo.

121
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,510
He admires her.

122
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,870
Why else would she be
able to stay in the company

123
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,710
after she missed out on Zhou Chuan

124
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,380
and Jiang Yu Cheng's new book?

125
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,070
There might be something
going on between them.

126
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,910
What nonsense are you talking about?

127
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,220
Say it again if you dare.

128
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,070
Who are you?

129
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,230
Who are you?

130
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,860
Do you believe that I can sue you

131
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,470
for defamation and bankrupt you?

132
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,500
I will call the cops now.

133
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,030
I will sue you for
physically threatening me.

134
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,550
Excuse me,

135
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,590
I tripped.

136
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,190
You know,

137
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,190
about Bai Zhi,

138
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,910
I know exactly what kind of person she is.

139
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,190
Parachute appointment?

140
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,040
She has got connections?
Those are nonsense.

141
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,870
I know that it has been tough

142
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,700
for her in the company.

143
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,430
When she signed me

144
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,230
back then,

145
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,510
no one

146
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,590
read my stupid book

147
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,780
I could barely afford food at that time.

148
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,270
Bai Zhi,

149
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,350
she rented a house for me,

150
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,350
she even hired a maid for me.

151
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,270
So that I could focus

152
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,670
and write something out.

153
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,110
So, my new book this time,

154
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,110
it has to be a hit.

155
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,270
She will continue to have a rough time

156
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,780
until I get famous, you know?

157
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,470
Do you know why is she going to

158
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,950
France this time?

159
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,190
She is going to see Maurer.

160
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,510
To sign his new book.

161
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,390
If she fails this time,

162
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,390
she will have to leave Xin Dun Books.

163
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,310
Do you know that?

164
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,110
She never told me.

165
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,750
That's because you don't care about her.

166
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,590
Mr Jiang,

167
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,670
if you don't like her,

168
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,670
convince her to give up.

169
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,550
We have broken up a long time ago.

170
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,350
But she still loves you.

171
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,980
Can you stop getting her hopes up?

172
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,380
I don't want to see
her keep being like this.

173
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,900
Because I really,

174
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,270
really like her.

175
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,710
Don't you have food at your house?

176
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,640
Why did you have to come here to eat?

177
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,870
If Chu Li hadn't invited me here,

178
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,310
I wouldn't have wanted to come too.

179
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,660
It's good to hear that.

180
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,590
The door is right there, go ahead.

181
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,390
He is not going anywhere.

182
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,070
Mr Jiang is my guest.

183
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,830
This is my house.

184
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,100
Yes! This is your house.

185
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,310
And I am just a pet in your house.

186
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,670
I don't deserve to invite
a friend over for breakfast.

187
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,750
I never...

188
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,360
I never said something like that.

189
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,230
You offended her?

190
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,830
Given your intelligence,

191
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,310
you wouldn't have realized it
even if you really offended her.

192
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,390
I really didn't.

193
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,270
Mr Jiang,

194
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,470
thank you for your help for
the Interactive Cultural Festival.

195
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,130
You wrote the openings for me.

196
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,190
You are welcome.

197
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,470
You made all of these?

198
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,230
Yes, I made all of these.

199
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,430
Eat up.

200
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,510
Okay.

201
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,390
This is yours.

202
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,110
I wrote the openings too.

203
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,900
Why do I get only a bowl of peanuts?

204
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,030
Why are you staring at me?

205
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,510
I said nothing wrong.

206
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,190
Why does he get a luxurious breakfast

207
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,620

208
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,870

209
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,510
Beggar set meal?

210
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,900
A beggar wouldn't be called a beggar,

211
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,030
if he could eat so well.

212
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,710
Mr Jiang, it's too noisy here.

213
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,750
Why don't I take you out to eat?

214
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,350
Sure.

215
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,590

217

Oh I know.

218
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,470
You guys are leaving me behind so that
you don't have to share the food.

219
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,670
Mr Zhou, all these dishes

220
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,070

No.

Looks like you don't
consider me a friend either

231

No, no, Mr Jiang.

232
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,430
Fine,

233
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,580
it's true that I am in a bad mood today.

Zhou Chuan that...

235
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,750
Zhou Chuan actually said that

236
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,060
to him, I am no different from Er Gou.

237
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,230
That does sound like
something he would say.

238
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,990
Right? No one can feel good

239
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,830
after hearing those words.

240
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,810
I am in a difficult spot right now.

241
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,510
As your friend,

242
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,770
I should enlighten you at time like this.

243
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,750
But as a man who is courting you,

244
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,350
if I say something good

245
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,190

246
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,050
doesn't that make me not serious?

248
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,870
Do I look like I'm not serious?

249
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,790
Very much so.

250
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,350
I think

251
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,590
if what Zhou Chuan said

upsets you,

253
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,420
my advice is tell him directly.

254
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,710
Otherwise, a single-celled
living being like him

255
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,940
may never realize that

256
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,540
he had said something wrong.

257
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,980
What he said wasn't exactly wrong.

258
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,950
I can't mandate that what place

259
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,550

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,070

Half of the submissions are to

274
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,630
Zhou Chuan and Jiang Yu Cheng.

275
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,630
You are awesome, Chu Li.

276
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,150
What does this have
anything to do with me?

277
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,270
It's all thanks to them.

278
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,870
But there were only about 60 submissions.

279
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,550
That's a lot less than

280
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,830
what I thought it would be.

281
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,510
What do you mean by only?

282
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,840
Do you know how many
we received last year?

283
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,790
We received only a total
of 135 submissions last year.

284
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,390
So, based on what you said,

285
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,910
this number is actually a miracle?

286
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,990
Yes.

287
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,270
Speaking of which,

are dominating the
entire content industry.

296
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,100
The fact that Yuan Yue still has
so many enthusiastic readers

297
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,110

298
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,790

299
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,260

300
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,220
[That's one awkward question to answer.]

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,110

She said I thought of her
as a pet this morning.

328
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,990

Mr Jiang, why do you keep staring at me?

373
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,030
I just feel

374
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,710
very relaxed when I am with you.

375
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,030
Who do you get nervous around?

376
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,710
Let me take you home.

377
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,790
It's fine, I have to go back to
the office to work overtime.

378
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,790
You are going back to the office to work?

379
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,270
I have kept you for so long,

380
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,910
is there anything I can do to help?

381
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,190
It's fine.

382
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,190
All you need to do is write the ending

383
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,950
and submit without any delays.

384
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,740
Look at the time now,
why isn't she back yet?

385
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,190
Not only did he take away my girl,

386
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,030
he even took my car this time.

387
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,710
What are you barking at?

388
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,950
This is your fault.

389
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,660
Go back to your room.

390
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,090
♫ Dream flies above the horizon ♫

391
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,980
♫ Night asks for dawn to come ♫

392
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,590
♫ Yet I'm still here ♫

393
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,140
Follow-up for Book of Luo He God.

00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:24,280
♫ Waiting for a mapless journey ♫

395
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,310
Author name.

396
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,150
The Ghost Behind You.

397
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,950
♫ The stillness you stirred ♫

398
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:39,230
♫ Fear is forgotten and
so is that time on the rooftop ♫

399
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,640
♫ Every footprint turns into
a stubborn silhouette ♫

400
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:53,060
♫ Nobody wants to be the first
to let their heart sway ♫

401
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,390
Kids nowadays,

402
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,780
their pseudonyms are just shocking.

403
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,470
♫ The wind quietly brought in a letter ♫

404
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,500
♫ It tells that meetings and partings ♫

405
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,950
Among this thick pile of works,

406
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,270
this is the only one
that is interesting.

407
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,350
♫ Are to carry on the eternal light ♫

408
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:14,320

♫ Love is a variation ♫

412
00:24:54,110 --> 00:25:00,250
♫ Occasionally melancholy,
occasionally full of bliss ♫

413
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,430
I am going back to my room.

414
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,970
♫ I once looked up and
the rain stopped filling the sky ♫

415
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,350
Take Er Gou to bed.

416
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,670
I don't think of you as Er Gou.

417
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:15,170
♫ Because you sheltered my tears ♫

418
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,710
Have you ever seen me tucking in Er Gou?

♫ The wind quietly brought in a letter ♫

420
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,280
Have you seen me waiting
for it until 3:00 in the morning?

♫ It tells that meetings and partings ♫

422
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,740
Because Er Gou is more
well-behaved than you.

♫ Are to carry on the eternal light ♫

424
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,400
At least it knows it
shouldn't be home this late.

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,680
♫ Glaring thoughts should not be heard ♫

426
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,900
I am going to sleep.

♫ Hide in a corner away from the light ♫

428
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:54,120
♫ Waiting for you to come ♫

429
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,510
Seriously?

430
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,150
Your friend forgave him just like that?

431
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,910
What else can she do?

432
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,550
Chu Li,

433
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,350
your friend might be falling deep in it.

434
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,710
No way.

435
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,030
Think about it,

436
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,550
her joys and sorrows change

437
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,910
because of what he said.

438
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,910
That's love.

439
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,030
Sounds like you got a point.

440
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,310
Ah Xiang,

441
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,820
you know so much about love.

442
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,580
Haven't you been single all your life?

443
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,950
I learnt these from dramas.

444
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,280
Second section of editorial department,
meeting in the conference room now.

445
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,190
What is the status of
the submissions for the week?

446
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,510
In seven days,

447
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,910
we received a total of 335 submissions.

448
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,270
105 follow-up fan fictions based
on Mr Zhou Chuan's works.

449
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,060
92 for Mr Jiang Yu Cheng's works.

450
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,350
79 for Mr He Ma's works.

451
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,310
54 for Mr Nian Nian's works.

452
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,310
And Ms Suo Heng

453
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,310
only got 5.

454
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,700
Are you sure you've sorted
through all the replies?

455
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,780
So far, yes.

456
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,230
So few.

457
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,110
Quantity is not good enough,

458
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,230
what about quality?

459
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,910
Basically unusable.

460
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,110
Keep this from the author first.

461
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,750
Miao, you are responsible for Suo Heng.

462
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,350
Is there anything you can do?

463
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,190
What solution can I come up with?

464
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,310
I have tried everything I can.

465
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,110
Is that so?

466
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,830
What have you tried? Tell me.

467
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,030
When she didn't write well, I got
someone to pick up where she left off.

468
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,510
But her openings are too intricate.

469
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,470
No one can pick it up.

470
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,870
You chose this piece yourself, didn't you?

471
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,190
How come you didn't
realize this issue before?

472
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,700
What do you think?

473
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,070
That's because her other articles

474
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,590
are not as good as this one.

475
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,630
That can't be.

476
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,710
I have read Ms Suo Heng's other articles,

477
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,970
they are much better to pick up than this.

478
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,070
That's your own opinion.

479
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,430
Have you read more articles

480
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,430
than I have?

481
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,350
Chief Editor Yu,

482
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,950
can we use another article
written by Ms Suo Heng?

483
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,630
Sure.

484
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,070
Didn't we hold this event for Suo Heng?

485
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,110
Because Suo Heng can't write well,

486
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,900
we had to get someone to write for her.

487
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,590
When no one is capable
of writing for her,

488
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,520
we just change to another article.

489
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,500
Right, looks like
Yuan Yue Publishing House

490
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,260
is opening only for Suo Heng.

491
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,630
Are we giving up on
the author just like this?

492
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,150
So what else can we do
if we don't give up on her?

493
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,030
Can she bring any value to

494
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,760
Yuan Yue Publishing House now?

495
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,030
That's enough.

496
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,870
The quality and quantity of submissions

497
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,230
are not up to standard,

498
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,510
it's not only the author's problem,

499
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,910
we editors are also responsible.

500
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,870
Miao, I don't care if
the selection of this article

501
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,030
was a mistake,

502
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,580
but we are having a problem now,

503
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,240
and you have to take care of it.

504
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,270
Please keep in mind that

505
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,550
authors and editors are tied together.

506
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,430
You rise or fall together.

507
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,790
Find a few tight-lipped authors

508
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,190
to help write the follow-up.

509
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,270
We can't afford to have any problem.

510
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,470
Meeting adjourned.

511
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,630
Chu Li,

512
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,070
since you care about Suo Heng so much,

513
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,710
why don't you get
someone to write for her?

514
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,870
Fine, I will do it.

515
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:41,090
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

516
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,870
Mr Cao,

517
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,470
for this year's
Interactive Culture Festival,

518
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,470
I'd like your help in writing a follow-up

519
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,400
for a science fiction's openings.

520
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,550
You are the best at science fiction.

521
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,470
Yes.

522
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,030
But you only have three days.

523
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,630
Thank you for your help.

524
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,190
Okay, okay.

525
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,310
Bye, bye.

526
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,950
Mum, Dad and I are here
to pick you up from work.

527
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,220
I am here.

528
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,710
Qiu Qiu, thank you for you and
Dad to come pick me up.

529
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,950
I didn't drive here today.

530
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,990
I was just thinking about

531
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,270
hailing a cab home.

532
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,400
I knew you would get off late from work.

533
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,590
By the way, my mom's
birthday is coming soon.

534
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,510
I want to gather the family

535
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,550
to have a meal together by then.

536
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,740
Don't forget it.

537
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,430
I won't forget her birthday.

538
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,790
I have got her gift.

539
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,510
Mum, let me tell you a secret,

540
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,870
I have prepared a gift for Grandma too.

541
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,180
Really? You have really grown up, Qiu Qiu.

542
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,070
The results of
the submissions came out today.

543
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,750
Mr Zhou, would you like to guess

544
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,680
how many submissions have you got?

545
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,790
No, it's predicable.

546
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,030
105 submissions in total.

547
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,350
105?

548
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,870
Is that many?

549
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,000
Yuan Yue Publishing House
is out of date indeed.

550
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,280
Don't you dare insult
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

551
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,830
How many have Jiang Yu Cheng received?

552
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,310
Less than me?

553
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,100
So,

554
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,910
what exactly is
the ranking of submissions?

555
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,190
Did Jiang Yu Cheng receive
much lesser submissions than me?

556
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,950
Only the author can know

557
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,310
the number of submissions for his article.

558
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,990
Other people is not allowed to know.

559
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,950
I am other people?

560
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,390
Especially certain people
with bad intentions.

561
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,830
Now I am other people.

562
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,780
Who begged to be
my managing editor back then?

563
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,420
We are all on the same team.

564
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,110
Don't you forget that

565
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,550
even though I am managing editor
of Book of Luo He God,

566
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,580
but I am also the managing editor of

567
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,110
Mr Jiang's
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

568
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,110
So,

569
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,160
how many submissions does
Jiang Yu Cheng actually receive?

570
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,070
If you sign your new novel

571
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,910
to Yuan Yue Publishing House,

572
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,910
I can consider that I will
only have eyes for you

573
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,750
in future.

574
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,750
Very tactical, you.

575
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,630
Tell me then.

576
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,630
Are there authors who receive submissions

577
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,160
so little that that can be
counted on one hand?

578
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,150
Mr Zhou, since you care
so much about your peers,

579
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,590
will you consider writing a follow-up

580
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,590
for author who receive
poor quality submissions?

581
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,790
Who is it?

582
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,790
Just tell me will you do it or not?

583
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,590
There is no way I would
be a ghostwriter for others.

584
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,510
Move, move, get out of my way.

585
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,470
You think I can't find out
about it if you don't tell me?

I just saw the message.

633
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,150
You are coming back?

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,270

despite you are not even back yet?

00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,190
That's enough.

let's talk about it after you return.

637
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,390
Bye.

638
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,990
Ms Chu, is the dinner ready?

639
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,220
Did you stay up all night

640
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,710
because you were worrying
about Suo Heng's submission?

641
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,270
Not only this.

642
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,150
Also, it's that friend of mine.

643
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,070
She saw the guy talking with

644
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,310
another woman on the phone,

645
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,220
they were talking and laughing.

646
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,230
Somehow,

647
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,990
she felt upset.

648
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,830
It's obvious that

649
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,790
that friend of yours was jealous.

650
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,510
Chu Li,

651
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,390
is that guy a playboy?

652
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,380
Calling him a playboy is
a flattering term for him.

653
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,510
Except for

654
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,510
my friend,

655
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,110
no one can stand him at all.

656
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,350
Mr Fox finished it so soon.

657
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,230
I thought Mr Fox would get rusty
in writing since he hadn't written

658
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,110
anything over the past years.

659
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,180
I didn't expect that he still got it.

660
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,430
Let me see, let me see.

661
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,110
How good can it be that

662
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,590
it impressed you so much?

663
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,520
Mr Zhou Chuan wrote this, isn't it?

664
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,340
The writer has such a wild imagination.

665
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,630
I even feel that

666
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,750
his wonderful storytelling skill

667
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,350
has completely surpassed

668
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,430
the openings written by Suo Heng.

669
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,870
This was not written by Zhou Chuan.

670
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,830
It's my friend.

671
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,190
Their styles are so similar.

672
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,270
It is obviously the same person.

673
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,110
Forget it, I am sending it
to Chief Editor Yu now.

674
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,030
I am sure of it.

675
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,270
Chu Li.

676
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,710
I read the draft.

677
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,830
It's nice.

678
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,430
The writing style is
sophisticated and neat.

679
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,110
The plots are brilliant.

680
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,510
Who wrote it?

681
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,350
Why do I feel that
his writing style is a bit similar

682
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,990
to Mr Zhou Chuan?

683
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,790
No, no, this wasn't written by Zhou Chuan.

684
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,180
It's my friend.

685
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,350
But he has mimicked
Zhou Chuan's writing style before.

686
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,990
He is known as Junior Zhou Chuan.

687
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,350
He has stopped writing for many years,

688
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,190
I am surprised that he is
still as good as ever.

689
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,860
He has saved the day for Suo Heng.

690
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
Thank him for me.

691
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,470
You can ask him to
write some short articles.

692
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,270
Really?

693
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,930
You really think he can write?

694
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,130
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

695
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,390
[Interested to write articles for us?
The money is good.]

696
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,830
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

697
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,030
Be honest with me,

698
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,070
was it written by Mr Zhou Chuan?

699
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,990
It really was not.

700
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,140
I swear that if I lie,

701
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,350
I would gain 20 pounds.

702
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:23,230
I asked him before,
he denied it immediately.

703
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,310
This is so strange.

704
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,150
What is so strange about it?

705
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,950
There are many authors
who write in the same style.

706
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,660
No, Chu Li.

707
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,910
I have been keeping watch on Mr Zhou Chuan

708
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,390
since he published his first book.

709
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,830
Every one of his books,

710
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,790
I have read them

711
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,030
more than ten times from beginning to end.

712
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,990
I noticed that Mr Zhou Chuan

713
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,430
has a special habit in writing books.

714
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,910
Between the paragraphs
of significant plot like this,

715
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,550
he always uses five ellipses.

716
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,030
At the end of his work,

717
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,030
he also uses five ellipses

718
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,950
and writes an End.

719
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,230
See.

720
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,350
This book is the same.

721
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,760
[End]

722
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,750
See this.

723
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,910
And look at that again.

724
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,950
[End]

725
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,350
It's the same, isn't it?

726
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,010
How's that possible? You must
have been watching too many dramas.

727
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,830
One, two, three, four, five.

728
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,190
After Zhou Chuan became famous,

729
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,630
Mr Fox started to stop writing.

730
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,110
Oh my god.

731
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,190
No way.

732
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,150
What should I do?

733
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,310
If Mr Zhou Chuan really is Mr Fox,

734
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,750
I have been mocking him every day

735
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,870
and calling him a Drama King.

736
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,430
That doesn't make sense.

737
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,350
If Mr Zhou Chuan

738
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,070
really is Mr Fox,

739
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,310
he would have killed me already
under these circumstances.

740
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,990
How could he be possibly
letting me freeloading off of him

741
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,650
and live in his house for free?

742
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,390
No.

743
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:19,990
It's not like that.

744
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,350
If Mr Zhou Chuan isn't Mr Fox,

745
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,150
we are not that close for him to

746
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,010
sacrifice his millions dollars worth
of house to let me live for free.

747
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,470
But I...

748
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,750
I clean his house,

749
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,810
make dinners and walk the dog for him.

750
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,670
But he can get anyone to do that for him.

751
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,070
No, no.

752
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,340
I have to ask him for answer.

753
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,750
If Mr Zhou Chuan

754
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,780
and Mr Fox are the same person,

755
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,030
then haven't I been fooling
by the same person

756
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,550
with two accounts?

757
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,870
No.

758
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,000
I will send him a message and bluff him.

759
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,510
[I twisted my ankle at the door,]

760
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:21,240
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

761
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,830
[I am not sure if my bone is fractured.]

762
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,870
[Open the door for me now.]

763
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,270
She managed to twist
her ankle while walking.

764
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,510
I am impressed.

765
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,510
Mr Zhou Chuan!

766
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,870
Your ankle...

767
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,480
What's wrong with my ankle?

768
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,070
[I twisted my ankle at the door,]

769
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,550
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

770
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,460
[I am not sure if my bone is fractured.]

771
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,920
[Open the door for me now.]

772
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,180
Your shoes are dirty,

773
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,710
you should wash it.

774
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,140
[I didn't get busted, did I?]

775
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,830
Good for you.

776
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,230
You have been coming
home late every night.

777
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,910
You didn't even walk Er Gou.

778
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,460
I let you live here for free.

779
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,030
Did Yu Yao pay you for working overtime?

780
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,190
Can't you tell which side

781
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,790
is more important?

782
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,990
Such a fool.

783
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,070
Yes, yes, yes.

784
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,600
I don't know what's good
for me, and I am a fool.

785
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,350
After all, when you advised me
not to join the publishing industry,

786
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,150
that I should first stay alive
before I go after my dreams,

787
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,540
I didn't listen to you.

788
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,170
That's right. When did
you ever listen to me?

789
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,470
[Oh no, that's what Mr Fox said to her.]
