Who is that?

5
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,940
[Hi.]

6
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,310
[Are you Mr Zhou Chuan?]

7
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,300
[I'm Chu Li, the editor of
Yuan Yue Books.]

8
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,759
[Here's the thing.]

9
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,430
[I sent you a message yesterday.]

10
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,030
[But you didn't reply to it.]

11
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,280
[That's why I came to find you.]

12
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,620
[Why her?]

13
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,270
Our deputy editor wants me

14
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,090
to talk to you about
the new book contract.

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,390
Zhou Chuan doesn't live here.

16
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,790
You got the wrong person.

17
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,750
I got the wrong person?

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,050
It's 2070 though.

19
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,790
Could there be two houses
numbered 2070 here?

20
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,480
[Zhou Chuan]

21
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,470
Zhou Chuan.

22
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,510
Who is that?

23
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,030
[Are you Mr Zhou Chuan?]

24
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,910
Here's an important parcel
that needs your signature.

25
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,220
What parcel?

26
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,750
Are you really Mr Zhou Chuan?

27
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,760
You deceived me!

28
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,750
No.

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,350
I'm truly sorry, Mr Zhou Chuan.

30
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,030
For talking to you like this.

31
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,310
I was left with no choice.

32
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,310
If I don't see you today, I need to...

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,510
Scram!

34
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,420
Hello, is this management department?

35
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,350
Mr Zhou, I'm really not a con artist.

36
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,750
I can explain.

37
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,790
Mr Zhou Chuan.

38
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,310
Mr Zhou Chuan, open the door, please.

39
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,900
Hurry up, she's over here!

40
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,510
The owner complained that
you're disturbing the residents.

41
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,829
Please leave immediately.

42
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,350
I'm not disturbing the residents.

43
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,190
Sirs.

44
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,510
Is there any misunderstanding?

45
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,070
I'm here for a business talk.

46
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,240
Since you don't want to leave,

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,700
we're left with no choice.

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,640
Gentlemen, let's have a good talk!

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,350
Brothers, we can have a good talk!

50
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,520
Let go of me!

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,940
Gentlemen, you're so strong.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,860
I know Ms Gu!

53
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,500
Wait a minute!

54
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,470
Ms Gu.

55
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,480
Do you still remember me?

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,990
We met during your visit to
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

57
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,990
Indeed.

58
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,520
You even embarrassed me
in front of everyone.

59
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,470
I know this girl. Let her go.

60
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,350
It's okay, you may leave now.

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,100
Thank you, Ms Gu.

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,340
I thought you're smart.

63
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,010
As a girl, you should remain decent.

64
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,070
Since Zhou Chuan refuses to show himself,
you won't get to see him.

65
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,269
You should get going.

66
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,920
Had you signed the new book contract
with Xin Dun Books earlier,

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,000
you'd have been living in peace, right?

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,640
You're full of perseverance indeed.

69
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,550
You came to find me right after
being transferred from Beijing.

70
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,840
How much pressure does Xin Dun Books

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,920
put on you when it comes to the KPIs?

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,870
I know.

73
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,280
You refuse to sign
the contract with Xin Dun Books

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,200
because you want to
see if there's any company

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,150
who can offer you a higher price.

76
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,080
But I'd say Xin Dun Books
offers the best conditions.

77
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,320
Does it?

78
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,550
When I signed
the Oriental Beauty with you guys,

79
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,210
I really didn't feel that way.

80
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,110
This time, we don't plan to set
a minimum number of printed copies.

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,400
Five million yuan.

82
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,550
To buy the full copyright of the book.

83
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,200
Well, that can save me a lot of trouble.

84
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,230
But I'm afraid I will repeat
Jiang Yu Cheng's mistake.

85
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,430
If you were to reject me because of this,

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,640
that'd be so irrational of you.

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,120
I just want to sign the contract

88
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
with a more sympathetic editor.

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,910
We have plenty of time.

90
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,110
After all, I've moved to
this neighbourhood.

once you've made up your mind.

96
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,350
don't come and bother me.

-Bye-bye.

105
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,200
have a listen to the contract conditions

106
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,740
before rejecting me?

107
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,270
Mr Zhou Chuan.

108
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,710
Mr Zhou Chuan, are you listening?

109
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,280
Turn to the first page of the contract.

-Sure.

I'm aware that she was here.

You bumped into each other?

00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,860
What a pity.

your dead body ashore.

I went to meet Mr Zhou Chuan.

134

But he's very dissatisfied
with our contract.

135
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,560
Could we increase
the minimum number of printed copies?

136
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Do you know what is
a minimum number of printed copies?

137
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,230
A minimum number of
printed copies is a figure

given by the circulation department

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,030
Listen.

186
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Zhou Chuan's minimum number of
printed copies cannot be changed.

187
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
If you can't get him sign the contract,
that's useless of you.

188
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,480
There are some in the editorial department
who have had contracts with great authors

189
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,070
with a lowest number of printed copies.

190
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,610
For example, Miao.

191
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,130
Can you learn from them?

192
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,320
Get out!

193
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,730

194
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,230
[The Disappearing Zoo]

195
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,290
[The Disappearing Zoo]

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr Luo.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,160
Ms Gu.

198
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,220
Are you busy?

199
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,520
Not at all.

200
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,130
Let me tell you something.

201
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Mr Li Yu would like to purchase
the right to Jiang Yu Cheng's

202
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,510
The Disappearing Zoo.

203
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,650
He gave a call to the big boss.

204
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Li Yu?

205
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,030
That's right.

206
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,640
You've been nurturing
Jiang Yu Cheng after all.

207
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,440
It shouldn't be a problem
to leave it to you, right?

208
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,630
Xiao Niao.

209
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,160
How's your negotiation with
Jiang Yu Cheng going?

210
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
I've asked my uncle to contact him.

211
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,200
We should hear from him very soon.

212
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,800
Great.

213
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,450
Jiang Yu Cheng is much
easy than Zhou Chuan.

214
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,630
I'm doing this

215
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,880
because I hope you can seal the contract

216
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
before Chu Li does.

217
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,140
Therefore, you need to work hard.

218
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,230
Got it.

219
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,240
Thank you, Chief Editor Miao.

220
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,410
It's Deputy Editor.

221
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,960
Get back to your work.

222
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,150
Deputy Editor Miao.

223
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,100
I bought you this coffee.

224
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,080
I don't know if it's
your favourite flavour.

225
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,810
If you don't like it,
I can go get another one.

226
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,010
Sure, thank you.

227
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,520
I heard that you met Zhou Chuan.

228
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,180
How's the negotiation going?

229
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,890
I didn't even have the chance to

230
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,070
to hand the contract to him
and have it thrown at my face.

231
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,170
Is it because you're
not good at negotiating?

232
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,800
Mr Liang told me

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,400
to ask you about negotiation techniques.

234
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,920
Deputy Editor Miao,
how did you manage the negotiation?

235
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,040
How did you decide on the figure?

236
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,120
All right.

237
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,860
Let me ask you something, Chu Li.

238
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,460
How many

239
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,160
minimum copies do you
think we should give him?

240
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,900
One hundred thousand.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,680
The first royalty for an author

242
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,200
is determined by the minimum
number of printed copies.

243
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
If he manages to receive a royalty of 15%,

244
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,650
that's impressive enough.

245
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,480
The figure he receives

246
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,590
is determined by the cost that I can bear.

247
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,730
We're running a publishing house here.

248
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,110
Our boss is a businessman.

249
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,080
And he needs to make money.

250
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Zhou Chuan.

251
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,600
He's got only one best-selling book.

252
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,560
Whether his next book is good or bad,

253
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,490
how his writing is,

254
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,840
none of us has a clue.

255
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,680
In our industry,

256
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,140
successful debut authors

257
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,660
can be found everywhere.

258
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,760
And when it comes to ordinary authors,

259
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,360
our publishing house offers

260
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,390
three to five thousand yuan.

261
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,720
But we paid Zhou Chuan

262
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,800
thirty thousand yuan
for his first payment.

263
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,480
And we increased it
to forty thousand yuan.

264
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,970
It's enough to prove

265
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,290
that our publishing house

266
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,060
has a very high regard for him.

267
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,230

268

if I were to tell Mr Zhou Chuan this,

269
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm afraid he'd beat me up

270
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,790
and send my body back here
through cash on delivery.

271
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,710
And we wouldn't pay for that.

272
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,010

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,320

the message to Zhou Chuan,

275

Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

387
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,470
It's bad for health to drink coffee
in the morning on an empty stomach.

388
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,380

389

Thanks.

390
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,690
But I'd like to remind you

391
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,150
that these buns don't worth as much as
the royalty of hundreds of thousands yuan.

392
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,490
Though the minimum number of
printed copies is forty thousand,

393
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,610
it's the highest figure
Yuan Yue Publishing House

394
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,890
has had from the past two years.

395
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,720
Our company is very sincere

396

to you. The sun and the moon
are the witnesses.

397
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,410
Then you go ask the sun and the moon

398
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,790
if I deserve to be
humiliated by these figures.

399
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,920
The sun and the moon are the witnesses?

400
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,490
What have I done to deserve this?

401

I guarantee.

404
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,890
If you sign the contract with us,

405
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,330
I will definitely take care of
the publication of your book.

406
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,670
We can even make it two hundred thousand,

407
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,620
not to mention one hundred thousand.

408
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,350
That's an empty promise.

411

Thank you for your buns.

412
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,630
Though mine isn't some cheap coffee.

Of course I'm confident with my work.

It's just that Yuan Yue Publishing House
doesn't deserve it.

In fact, you care not only

the contract with Xin Dun Books.

that Yuan Yue Publishing House's

435

On the surface, you seem to be unwilling.

436

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,290
I'm watching a movie.

548
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,990
You've watched it for times yesterday.

549
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,560
Stop watching it.

550
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,270
What's happened?

551
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,490
Some reader has figured out
your true colours?

552
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,950
What true colours?

553
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,940
I'm as good-natured as I am.

554
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,090
I

555
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,580
Sir Chuan who is as warm as a jade.

556
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,370
But you're lack of self-awareness.

557
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,100
Stop talking nonsense.

558
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,440
Let me talk to you
about something serious.

559
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,520
I met that netizen today.

560
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,180
Netizen?

561
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,380
You've known her for three years.

562
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,220
You fight all the time.
But you're never apart.

563
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,210
As if you're in a relationship.

564
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,270
We're not in a relationship.

565
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,760
We're purely netizens.

566
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,080
Yes.

567
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,590
Purely netizens.

568
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,850
You always giggle while
playing with your phone.

569
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,120
How pure.

570
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,820
What?

571
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,480
You met the netizen today,
and it's a sad ending?

572
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,880
Not at all.

573
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,880
It's just that...

574
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,740
How should I put it?

575
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,040
After all kinds of coincidences,

576
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,830
she's now my editor.

577
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,690
This morning, she came to
my place with the buns.

578
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,820
And then she asked me to sign
a publishing contract

579
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,550
that offers only forty thousand
printed copies and a royalty of 9%.

580
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,540
The thing is,

581
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:44,180
I drove her away in
a very malicious manner.

582
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,730
I drove her away.

583
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,160
She doesn't know you're Mr Fox anyway.

584
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,360
What are you panicking about?

585
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,290
Shouldn't I be panicking about it?

586
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,590
I drove her away without
even considering her feelings.

587
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,070
What if she finds out the truth

588
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,110
and write a book out of anger called

589
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,490
"Let's Talk About Sir Chuan
That You All Used to Love."

590
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,720
And it becomes the top-selling title on
every online bookstore and website.

591
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,900
Then I...

592
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,840
What are you laughing about?

593
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,940
What should I do now?

594
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,860
What are you saying? Just sign it.

595
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,640
Would you sign a contract that
offers forty thousand printed copies?

596
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,530
Let me be honest with you.

597
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,560
Considering the market situation,

598
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,760
that's a decent offer
from the publishing house.

599
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,210
As long as you can get it sold,

600
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,780
you will receive the royalty
and that from the second printing.

601
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,140
Also, aren't you negotiating about
the rights to the comic and game?

602
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,620
So what are you discontent about?

603
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,580
I'm discontent about
the amount of royalty.

604
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,270
It's not enough to pay for Er Gou's food.

605
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,380
Okay.

606
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,010
You do know what I want.

607
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,300
I do.

608
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,560
Someday, you're going to be
an author at the top of the pyramid.

609
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,790
And surpass your father.

610
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,480
All the more reason why you should
sign the contract with Yuan Yue Books.

611
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,960
Isn't that where he created the miracle?

612
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,690
Now is the beginning.

613
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,100
Why did you and her say the same thing?

614
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,800
Are you working in
collusion with each other?

615
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,380
We have never met before.
How can we be doing that?

616
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,920
Enough.

617
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,280
Aren't you here

618
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,030
so that I can talk you
into signing the contract?

619
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,830
Who said I want to sign the contract?

620
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,930
Fine.

621
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,220
Don't you sign it.

622
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,250
If you sign it, that makes you a dog.

623
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,660
Wait, something has gotten into you.

624
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,340
Why don't you comfort me?
Why are you mad at me?

625
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,380
Today,

626
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,220
Gu Bai Zhi came to the shop.

627
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,680
Who?

628
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,360
Gu Bai Zhi!

629
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,100
Fine. Tell me early when she comes again.

630
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,920
If Monstress ever bumps into you,
I'll stay as far away as possible.

631
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,090
And don't you come and bother me.

632
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,000
Or I'd write a book about you.

633
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,410
It's no fun writing about me.

634
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,790
Hurry up and finish writing your book.

635
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,380
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'd feel ashamed

636
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,510
and quit writing due to our disparity.

637
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,800
Does everyone think that

638
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,910
I can't stand up?

639
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,200
Please don't simply dehumanise me.

640
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,680
Thank you.

641
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,310
[If I don't manage to sign the contract
and publish your book,]

642
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,640
[there's no way I can stay at
the Yuan Yue Publishing House.]

643
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,909
[Chu Li, Literary Editor,
Phone, WeChat, Email, QQ]

644
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,900
[Zhou Chuan]

645
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,780
[Tomorrow, 11 p.m.
Bring along your contract.]

646
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,949
[Does it mean he agrees
to sign the contract?]

647

[Zhou Chuan]

648
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
[Latecomer won't be entertained.]

649
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,700
What am I doing?

650
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,260
It's only 10:30?

651
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,490
Hello, Er Gou. We meet again.

652
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,410
I'm here to see your daddy.

653
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,530
I'm its brother, not its daddy.

654
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,000
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

655
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,530
Mr Zhou Chuan, have you made up your mind?

656
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,330
Do you really want to
sell me the Book of Luo He?

657
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,510
No, I lied to you.

658
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,420
It's a prank. Are you happy now?

659
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,660
What's wrong?

660
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,500
I can't find my seal.

661
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,070
I may have to look for it.

662
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,090
Huh?

663
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,010
How many times have I told you?

664
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,920
Mr Nian Nian's next instalment

665
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,040
is about the reunion between
the male and female protagonists

666
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,410
after a long time apart.

667
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,390
Mr Nian Nian specifically asked you

668
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,920
to come up with illustrations
that are radiantly sorrowful.

669
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,830
Look at your work.

670
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,700
Tell me. What is this?

671
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,750
I only find it radiant.
Where's the sense of sorrow?

672
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,190
Deputy Editor Miao.

673
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,960
I gave it a thought.

674
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,740
I really have no idea
what radiantly sorrowful means.

675
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,810
So I...

676
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,110
Radiantly sorrowful...

677
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,550
Can you

678
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,070
figure out a solution first
when facing some difficulty?

679
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,990
Have the curls turned you into an idiot?

680
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,770
Stay still!

681
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,230
Tell me. What kind of attitude is this?

682
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,770
What kind of gesture is this, huh?

683
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,590
You're not happy because I scolded you.

684
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,850
-So you gave me middle finger.
-No.

685
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,480
You're giving your leader a middle finger.

686
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,800
She just tried to push her glasses up.

687
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,440
Right, Ah Xiang?

688
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,350
What pushing the glasses up?

689
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,070
Why did you come in so late?

690
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,600
I...

691
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,300
I went to Mr Zhou Chuan's place
this morning to sign the contract.

692
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,260
Have you signed it?

693
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,620
We're almost there.

694
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,610
When we're ready to sign the contract,

695
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,680
Mr Zhou Chuan couldn't find the seal.

696
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,930
But we can sign it
once he's found the seal.

697
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,520
Well, Chu Li,

698
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,880
I'm afraid the seal is lost forever.

699
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,090
He's rejected you.

700
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,820
Why do I feel that Mr Zhou Chuan
has lost the seal for real?

701
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,240
Miao.

702
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,010
Chu Li is a newbie.

703
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,430
You had the contract with you

704
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,250
for more than two weeks, but you
didn't get Mr Zhou Chuan sign it.

705
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,580
How can you expect her
to do so in a few days?

706
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,360
Chu Li, here's the thing.

707
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,460
You don't have to stay out of
the office for the whole morning.

708
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,010
You need to improve
your work efficiency. Got it?

709
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,040
Mr Zhou Chuan isn't the only author
under Yuan Yue Publishing House.

710
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,110
And that isn't your only task.

711
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,920
Got it, Chief Editor Yu.

712
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,390
I won't be late for work tomorrow.

713
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,620
Anyway, we need to pick up the pace.

714
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,820
The Marketing Department
people came today.

715
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,120
They said they need
the result by next week.

716
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
What's the seal?

717
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,930
♫ I want to hide like a kid
who made mistakes ♫

718
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,290
♫ My heart skipped a beat ♫

719
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,160
♫ When you look at me
everything seems so cute ♫

720
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,380
Well,

721
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,440
thank you for your help today.

722
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,650
♫ I am the only one feeling strange ♫

723
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,750
Don't take it to heart. Is this for me?

♫ But I can't tell ♫

726
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,170
The juice tea tastes so nice.

727
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,840
The sweetness is just right.

728
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:19,770
Ah Xiang.

729
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,850
♫ I still have my sanity ♫

730
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,160
You know what?

731
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,460
Your illustrations are
actually very interesting.

732
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,950
You purposely leave
the facial expressions out

733
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,030
and let the reader to
imagine the emotions.

734
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,070
♫ I fled for a week ♫

735
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,620
People had a dig at Feng Zi Kai

736
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,270
♫ You don't seem to be surprised ♫

737
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,320
due to this drawing style.

738
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,690
But fortunately, he ended up becoming
the grand master in comic industry.

739
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,110
♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

740
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,670
No, I'm not amazing.

741
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,680
♫ I have told you a thousand times ♫

742
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,620
I'm just an illustrator
of little importance.

743
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,140
♫ The world is on
the verge of elimination ♫

744
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,490
I think highly of you.

745
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,250
Do you know Cocoon?

746
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,600
♫ Only you are still favoured by me ♫

747
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,670
I thought highly of her
even before she became famous.

748
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,730
And now she's

749
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,580
the leading figure in
medieval art industry.

750
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,750
♫ Because when you hold me in your arms ♫

751
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,000
Therefore, you must believe in yourself.

752
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,130
Thank you, Chu Li.

753
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,750
♫ I have never felt so right ♫

754
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,330
I want to tell you this.

755
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,140
I don't think Mr Zhou Chuan
is that kind of person.

756
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,730
♫ If this is not love ♫

757
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,000
If he wanted to reject you,
he would've done it directly.

758
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,400
♫ What can I tell myself ♫

759
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,090
He wouldn't have found some excuse.

760
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,460
We're of the same mind.

761
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,970
Not to mention the seal,

762
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,010
I believe he'd lost himself.

763
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,380
Chu Li.

764
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,340
When you visit Mr Zhou Chuan next time,

765
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,590
can you ask for his autograph?

766
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,130
♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

767
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,530
I like him so much.

768
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,220
Sure, no problem.

769
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,380
♫ I have told you a thousand times ♫

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,810
Thank you.

771
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,030
-I'll give you a hand.
-Sure.

♫ You don't have to guess ♫

773
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,670
Let's go.

774

♫ How much I depend on you ♫

779
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,230
[Good morning, Mr Zhou Chuan.]

780
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,790
[May I know have you found the seal?]

781
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,890
♫ What can I tell myself ♫

782
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,310
All you know is rush me.

783
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,470
I can write a million words per day.

784
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,660
And it's just a seal, isn't it?

785
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,990
What's so hard about it?

786
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,190
[No way.]

787
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,670
[I'll go to Mr Zhou Chuan's
place this afternoon.]

788
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:24,530
[The sooner we find the seal out,
the sooner we can seal the contract.]

789
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,900
-Morning, Chief Editor Yu.
-Morning.

790
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,050
-Morning, Chief Editor Yu.
-Morning.

791
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,900
Well, I just received the announcement.

792
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,090
An author is visiting us at 2 p.m.

793
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,240
One of you will go tidy up the library.

794
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,820
Chu Li shall see to it, then.

795
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,030
You see, each of us has to
do our own work.

796
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,490
And Xiao Niao needs to finish up

797
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,860
the PowerPoint presentation
for Jiang Yu Cheng.

798
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,670
[I finally have the chance
to meet Mr Jiang.]

799
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,990
Have you reached Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

800
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,840
Mr Jiang said that, before the meeting,

801
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,590
he'd like to know more about
our opinions about his novels.

802
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,570
Though he asked for a simple document,

803
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,710
I want to make him a detailed
PowerPoint presentation.

804
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,690
Sure. Hurry up and finish it up.

805
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,390
Okay.

806
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,510
Chu Li, I'll leave the library to you.

807
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,670
Okay.

808
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,670
Great!

809
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,590
Jiang Yu Cheng has finally come back!

810
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,390
The day has finally come!

811
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,990
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

812
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,130
Chu Li.

813
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,870
Do you know Mr Jiang Yu Cheng's
works very well?

814
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,520
Indeed.

815
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,400
I've read each of his novels
more than five times.

816
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,150
Then can you help me to do
the PowerPoint presentation for him?

817
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,560
Huh? I help you to do it?

818
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,800
I've something important on tonight.

819
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,420
I really can't make it.

820
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,920
Please.

821
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,140
But if I help you to do it,

822
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,130
how can you communicate with Mr Jiang

823
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,110
without understanding the contents?

824
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,190
Don't you worry.

825
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,280
I'll memorise all the contents.

826
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,950
Xiao Niao.

827
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,950
Did you find Mr Jiang's Jiangnan Circuit

828
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,280
a good read?

829
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,360
I read it when I was in high school.

830
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,160
But it's been a long time.
I don't remember it well.

831
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,590
Jiangnan Circuit is Mr Kou Wei's work.

832
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,210
Xiao Niao.

833
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,060
It's not that I'm not willing to help you.

834
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,520
But since Miao asked
you to contact Mr Jiang,

835
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,260
it's your job to understand his works.

836
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,160
That's the way to
show respect for the author.

837
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,020
I'm really sorry.

838
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,780
I can't help you with it.

839
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:15,840
[Little Monkey]

840
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,100
[Mr Zhou Chuan.]

841
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,540
[Can I come to your place this afternoon?]

842
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,880
Fine. You just want to
see me for the seal, don't you?

843
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,920
[Chu Li]
[Zhou Chuan]

844
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,540
[The seal. Come here at once.]
