[Episode 22]

4
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,750
You're done

5
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,789
showing Mr Zhou Chuan around?

6
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,070
Why is your face red?

7
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,509
I...

8
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,780
It... It's hot in here.

9
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,509
Hot?

10
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,870
Mr Zhou Chuan.

11
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,930
We don't have a vacant desk right now.

12
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,230
How about that corner?

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,780
Will it do?

14
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,150
Chu Li is my editor.

15
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,750
I want to learn from her.

16
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,310
-I'm thinking of sitting closer to her.
-In that case,

17
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,310
Mr Zhou Chuan, you can sit here.

18
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,990
Mr Zhou Chuan won't let his reader

19
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,310
move to another desk.

20
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,590
She's right.

21
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,440
Ah Xiang, you don't have to
move to another desk.

22
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,829
By the way,
what were you doing over there just now?

23
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,470
Mr Zhou Chuan.

24
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,470
I was transferring a fish.

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,470
Our company has a custom.

26
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,550
Whenever a newcomer comes in,

27
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,480
we'll add a fish into the aquarium.

28
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,470
This welcoming ritual is

29
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,870
pretty novel.

30
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,750
Why don't I sit over there?

31
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,850
Can I, Chief Editor Yu?

32
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,070
No problem.

33
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,430
As you wish.

34
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,150
In that case, make sure Mr Zhou Chuan
is well taken care of.

35
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,610
I need to attend a meeting.

36
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,030
At your editorial department just now,

37
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,230
I took a glance at the shelves

38
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,430
with editor names on them.

39
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,590
If it weren't for the Book of Luo He God,

40
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,870
your shelf must have been

41
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,270
the shabbiest one among all.

42
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,670
Why didn't you adhere to
what we have discussed?

43
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,930
Didn't we agree that we have to
maintain a little distance?

44
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,950
We are in fact maintaining

45
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,110
this little distance now.

46
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,340
I gave it another thought.

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,100
We've been working closely for so long,

48
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,740
but now we're suddenly like strangers
after coming into the office.

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,270
Don't you think it's weird?

50
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,830
That does make some sense.

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,140
What is this?

52
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,630
Mr Zhou Chuan.

53
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,630
This is your assignment today.

54
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,750
You have to go to the reception area

55
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,110
to receive contributors
who came to submit their manuscripts.

56
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,500
You just need to write down
the contributor's information

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,510
into this record book.

58
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,950
I'm not doing this.

59
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,590
You said you want to learn from me.

60
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,870
But you refused the first assignment

61
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,860
that I planned for you today?

62
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,790
Mr Zhou Chuan.

63
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,940
Do you know why you are here?

64
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,110
Mr Zhou Chuan, you can do it.

65
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,430
You can do it.

66
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,190
Chu Li.

67
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,470
Come to my office.

68
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,790
Have a seat.

69
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,870
Have you read the new book

70
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,830
written by Yun Fei from Xin Dun Books?

71
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,620
I just finished reading it last night.

72
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,510
The ending was a bit hasty.

73
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,790
We just had a long meeting.

74
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,190
Liang Chong Lang

75
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,150
made a big fuss out of

76
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,790
Yun Fei's new work, The Dogtail Mink.

77
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,110
He said the sales of novels
by a few suspense authors

78
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,150
are underperforming lately.

79
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,190
He also said that

80
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,110
when our official platform

81
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,470
released news about our collaboration

82
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,470
with Mr Jiang Yu Cheng,

83
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,510
the response was ordinary.

84
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,670
Hence,

85
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,500
he suggested that

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,110
we defer our collaboration plan
with Mr Jiang Yu Cheng

87
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,950
and let Miao's Role Playing Game
publish his autobiography first.

88
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,630
How can we do that?

89
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,110
Isn't the publication date fixed?

90
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,430
What will Mr Jiang think of this?

91
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,190
Besides, we don't know how long
this will be deferred.

92
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,110
Mr Jiang can't afford to wait.

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,430
Liang Chong Lang also
mentioned another thing.

94
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,750
Publication date of Mr Jiang Yu Cheng's
book, The Disappearing Amusement Park

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,910
might clash with Huang Quan Inn,

96
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,550
Mr Zhou Chuan's book.

97
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,550
He's afraid it won't stand a chance.

98
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,870
Has big boss agreed?

99
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,540
Mr Xia knew

100
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,350
Jiang Yu Cheng's last two books
did not do well.

101
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,470
This new one is especially critical.

102
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,070
So he insisted that
it must be published first.

103
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,710
The top management

104
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,070
has not expressed their stand on this.

105
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,420
After all, this is a competition
with Xin Dun Books.

106
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,990
From the sales of
Book of Luo He God previously,

107
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,390
the difference is clear.

108
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,110
And we can see that

109
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,070
the top management is worried
about the previous sales performance

110
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,900
of Jiang Yu Cheng's books.

111
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,870
If an author fails
three times consequently,

112
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,510
it'd be hard for him to make a comeback.

113
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,110
Though this is just
a jest of the industry,

114
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,190
But

115
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,950
all eyes are on the book now.

116
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,590
We have to find a way

117
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,270
so that all major dealers
and the top management

118
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,870
can feel confident about it.

119
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,130
[The Disappearing Amusement Park, Chapter 3]

120
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,510
[Mr Zhou Chuan.]

121
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,110
[What time is it?
Why are you not sleeping yet?]

122
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,830
[Can you think of your health?]

123
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,910
[Quick. Go to bed now.]

124
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,310
[You just gave me a scare.]

125
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,440
[You call that thinking of my health?]

126
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,000
[Moonlight]

127
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,990
[You're reading Moonlight?]

128
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,230
[Didn't your instalment just ended?]

129
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,470
[Are you reading Mr Jiang's]

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,230
[The Disappearing Amusement Park?]

131
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,830
[How is it?]

132
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,630
[Isn't it surprisingly good?]

133
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,390
[I was thinking.]

134
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,270
[After the publication of this book,]

135
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,400
[you can hold a book signing session.]

136
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,070
[He has never gone public.]

137
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,110
[So this can be a huge gimmick]

138
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,640
[to boost his popularity.]

139
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,270
Mr Zhou Chuan suggested previously

140
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,950
that Mr Jiang can hold
a book signing session.

141
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,950
Since he has never gone public,

142
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,070
by making an appearance,

143
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,500
it'll definitely attract many readers

144
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,150
to come see him in person.

145
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,140
If this is part of the publication plan

146
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,510
for pre-launch publicity,

147
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,150
I would suggest he hold

148
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,830
a suspense film seminar.

149
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,230
Mr Jiang has been reviewing

150
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,230
suspense films online.

151
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,790
Moreover, his viewpoint is very unique.

152
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,230
Many readers urged him to

153
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,710
publish a movie review collection.

154
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,350
This is a good idea.

155
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,790
Immediately work on it.

156
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,030
Ask Mr Jiang for his opinion.

157
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,490
We're running out of time.

158
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,190
Alright.

159
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,430
I'll talk to him.

160
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,270
Good.

161
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,390
Let me begin then.

162
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,070
The pattering rain

163
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,310
are my tears.

164
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,190
I stand by the window

165
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,350
looking at the afterglow of sunset.

166
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,510
The tiny dust

167
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,870
spilling in from the window

168
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,429
is shattered by time.

169
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,070
I wanted to say...

170
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,950
Madam Lin.

171
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,670
You can stop.

172
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,510
Call me Linda.

173
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,470
I think you should find another job.

174
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,910
I'll be honest with you.

175
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,550
Many publishing houses are eyeing

176
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,350
my autobiography now.

177
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,150
But I only like Moonlight.

178
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,550
I like a steady guy like you

179
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,350
to be my

180
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,870
editor.

181
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,310
I hope

182
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,390
you give it a thought.

183
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,580
What I'm trying to say is, you'd better

184
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,190
stop writing

185
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,850
and stop giving us a hard time.

186
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,870
What do you mean?

187
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,710
I...

188
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,230
Listen here.

189
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,790
Everyone who has read my writings
says they are good.

190
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,590
They say I'm an unprecedented talent.

191
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,540
Do you even know what you're doing?

192
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,590
What's your name?

193
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,050
I want to file a complaint.

194
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

195
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,390
You are?

196
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,830
Call me Ms Lin.

197
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,360
That's how authors are addressed
these days.

198
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,740
Hi, Ms Lin.

199
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,430
I'm an editor here.

200
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,990
You can pass your manuscript to me

201
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,270
and I'll pass it to the chief editor.

202
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,430
If there's any news about it,

203
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,350
I'll contact you.

204
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,510
This should be the attitude.

205
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,180
I have two phone numbers

206
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,550
and three email addresses.

207
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,550
But I only have this business card.

208
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,870
Take out your pen to write in down.

209
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,470
Yes, yes.

210
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,510
Your new intern

211
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,430
has looks

212
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,390
but are terrible with words.

213
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,470
Have you written it down?

214
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,310
Yes, yes. It's all written down.

215
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,310
I've written it down, Ms Lin.

216
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,140
I'll contact you if there's news.

217
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,270
Alright then.

218
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,460
A nothing.

219
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,070
You asked me to do this.

220
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,670
It's my mistake.

221
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,430
I forgot.

222
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,510
You're only gentle and kind

223
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,540
for your readers.

224
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,570
You don't have to do this anymore.

225
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,470
This whole morning,

226
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,470
I've experienced a lot of feelings.

227
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,150
You now feel how hard

228
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,550
an editor's job is, don't you?

229
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,950
No.

230
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,300
I rediscover that my level of writing

231
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,310
is absolutely that of a genius.

232
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,700
It's lunch break.

233
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,670
You can go have your lunch.

234
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,990
-I...
-Mr Zhou Chuan.

235
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,630
You've not eaten?

236
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,350
Why don't we all

237
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,310
go for a lunch?

238
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,510
It'll be your welcoming ritual.

239
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,670
No, thanks.

240
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,730
I'm having lunch with my girlfriend.

241
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,540
Your girlfriend is working in this area?

242
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,550
She's not far.

243
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,950
The reason I come to work
at Yuan Yue Publishing House

244
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,350
is to be closer to her.

245
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,990
Lunch break is only one and a half hour.

246
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,150
Mr Zhou Chuan.

247
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,070
Time is very short.

248
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,540
You won't be able to eat anything
if you don't go now.

249
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,350
Go quick.

250
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,680
Just one and a half hour?

251
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,110
I don't know this area.

252
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,430
Can you take me there?

253
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,820
Go then.

254
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,830
Alright.

255
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,630
Let's go.

256
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,660
Let's go.

257
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,030
I just want to hold your hand.

258
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,150
You think I'm a pervert?

259
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,910
It's all red now.

260
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,630
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,910
I'll buy a cold drink so you can use it
to reduce the swell.

262
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,540
Blow it for me.

263
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,750
Why don't you just go to Mount Everest

264
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,010
and blow it from there?

265
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,780
Mr Zhou Chuan.

266
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,980
I'm actually happy you came
to Yuan Yue Publishing House.

267
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,470
But,

268
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,190
Yuan Yue Publishing House

269
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,820
is only 500 metres away.

270
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,070
There're many acquaintances around.

271
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,990
It's best

272
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,850
not to have any physical contact.

273
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,100
Fine.

274
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,950
We'll set Yuan Yue Publishing House
as the centre.

275
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,190
The length of this road is the radius.

276
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,050
How about that?

277
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,270
Let's cross the road.

278
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,390
No.

279
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,510
The radius must be five kilometres.

280
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,980
Why do I feel like I'm at a wet market

281
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,630
negotiating with you?

282
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,230
There're many restaurants over there.

283
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,190
At lunch time,

284
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,310
just pick anyone you like.

285
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,390
I have work outside office.

286
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,520
I'll leave you to it.

287
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,030
What are you doing?

288
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,030
You said

289
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,710
no physical contact.

290
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,270
I want to join you.

291
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,430
You better don't.

292
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,270
I have a work assignment.

293
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,790
Me too.

294
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,710
Since I want to learn from you,

295
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,040
then I'll follow you
whether it's inside or outside office.

296
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,950
Alright then.

297
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,910
This is your idea anyway.

298
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,030
Let's go now.

299
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,260
Keep walking.

300
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,870
Why are you here?

301
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,950
For work of course.

302
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,070
I should be asking you.

303
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,830
So?

304
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,350
You're already becoming a clingy pet

305
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,390
that can't let go?

306
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,190
-You...
-Alright now.

307
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,510
Mr Jiang.

308
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,910
Zhou Chuan is interning
at Yuan Yue Publishing House

309
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,550
to collect new ideas for his book.

310
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,430
Coming here with me

311
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,030
is for work too.

312
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,820
The reason I contacted you today

313
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,710
is to see if you're interested to

314
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,870
hold a suspense film seminar.

315
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,030
Seminar?

316
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,430
As pre-launch publicity for
The Disappearing Amusement Park?

317
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,700
I saw that

318
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,030
your official platform has released news

319
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,630
about this book.

320
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,430
But

321
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,470
compared to the response
for this fellow's,

322
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,700
mine is too lukewarm.

323
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,110
You must be worried.

324
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,630
No, no.

325
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,750
Mr Jiang.

326
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,630
You must never use Mr Zhou Chuan

327
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,030
for comparison.

328
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,350
The number of shares for his book is high

329
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,870
only because people were giving him face

330
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,390
and joining in the fun.

331
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,270
I know you meant

332
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,110
to comfort him,

333
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,030
but I just don't feel comfortable

334
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,630
listening to it.

335
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,160
Good advice is always
unpleasant to the ears.

336
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,790
Mr Jiang.

337
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,390
You've been lying low for so long.

338
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,910
This is a great opportunity

339
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,190
to return to the spotlight.

340
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,270
Tell everyone that

341
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,870
the King has returned.
Your new book is coming.

342
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,430
As your reader,

343
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,710
when I imagine about it,

344
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,150
I'm so fired up.

345
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,470
Do you want to

346
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,750
consider it?

347
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,670
I personally

348
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,730
don't object to it.

349
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,670
I simply feel

350
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,870
it's a lot of trouble.

351
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,630
I know.

352
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,420
I always fast-talk you,

353
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,830
like the boy who cries wolf.

354
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,060
But,

355
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,510
I still want to say that

356
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,310
this time, the wolf
is really at the valley.

357
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,230
I know you have high hopes

358
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,230
on this book.

359
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,190
In fact all of us

360
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,230
hope you can turn this around

361
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,380
and make a comeback.

362
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,430
Hence, Mr Jiang,

363
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,110
I really hope you can consider this.

364
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,190
For the sales and the comeback,

365
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,130
some kind of sacrifice is needed.

366
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,070
Mr Jiang.

367
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,590
I will think about it seriously.

368
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,350
Is circulation department

369
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,190
trying to hamper
The Disappearing Amusement Park?

370
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,780
What did you hear?

371
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,300
What I suggested was
a book signing session.

372
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,990
Why is it a seminar now?

373
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,660
Honestly,

374
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,510
to resume Mr Jiang's publication plan,

375
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,110
book signing event is too late.

376
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,510
We plan to generate pre-launch publicity.

377
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,230
But after the talk just now,

378
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,510
I think he might not want it.

379
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,630
Even at his prime,

380
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,590
Jiang Yu Cheng never had
a book signing event.

381
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,620
In that case,

382
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,590
his attitude towards this is same as mine.

383
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,190
We instinctively reject it.

384
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,510
Then why did you suggest it
in the first place?

385
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,220
I just casually mentioned it.

386
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,280
I never thought you'd keep it in mind.

387
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,950
Don't worry.

388
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,790
We have some difference too.

389
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,550
Just that this time,

390
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,430
he really can't fail.

391
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,300
You're doubled-face.

392
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,390
You're deep down worried too.

393
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,630
It also crossed my mind

394
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,220
that I might lose my fame someday too.

395
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,270
Because of one book,
readers feel disappointed

396
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,980
with the author

397
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,980
and forgetting all of it
really is the scariest thing.

398
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,470
An author who has never gone public
appearing at an event

399
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,410
is probably the last gimmick.

400
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,960
Whether he can bounce back to life

401
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,510
will all depend on whether the work

402
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,910
is worthy of being
the final cast of the die.

403
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,030
You also think
The Disappearing Amusement Park

404
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,550
is a worthy final cast of the die?

405
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,270
I didn't say that.

406
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,950
It came out of your mind.

407
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,550
Let me go.

408
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,750
Five kilometres.

409
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,410
What are you doing?

410
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,350
Come here.

411
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,790
Look.

412
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,320
This spot is 5.1 kilometres
from Yuan Yue Publishing House.

413
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,470
Physical contact is allowed.

414
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,030
You're so childish.

415
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,390
I enjoy it.

416
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,270
Just so childish.

417
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,440
Alright, that's the end of
the 0.1 kilometre.

418
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,510
I'll run away.

419
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,810
[The Disappearing Zoo]

420
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,910
[Mr Jiang, about the seminar,]

421
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,480
[Chu Li]

422
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,470
[have you considered it?]

423
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,440
[Jiang Yu Cheng]

424
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,550
[I agree.]

425
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,350
Mr Jiang agreed!

426
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,880
-Really? Let me see.
-Look.

427
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,550
He really did.

428
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,590
That's great.

429
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,070
Thanks, Mr Jiang.

430
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,630
But if you're doing the seminar,

431
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,150
you have to do some preparation.

432
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,870
Remember to buy a suit.

433
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,430
And get your hair styled.

434
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,550
If you're free tomorrow,
why don't I...

435
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,870
I, Zhou Chuan will accompany you.

436
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,030
He's a 30 year-old man.

437
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,420
How can he not know
how to buy a suit and style his hair?

438
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,180
Why do you need to worry about it?

439
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,110
I'll just accompany him tomorrow.

440
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,870
I know.

441
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,470
Among everyone, you're actually
hoping the hardest

442
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,190
for Mr Jiang to make a comeback.

443
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,220
Aren't you?

444
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,470
I'm warning you.

445
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,800
Don't put your heart
all into his seminar.

446
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,370
Where should I put it then?

447
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,190
On me.

448
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,230
I haven't submitted
the outline of my instalment.

449
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,670
You should pay more attention about it.

450
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,590
Then you have to teach me.

451
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,350
How should I do that?

452
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,670
Should I squat in front of your room

453
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,390
and scream at you everyday?

454
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,030
And in return, you're going to
use the 30 Tenant Rules

455
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,070
to bind me.

456
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,990
It's been a week since I started
at Yuan Yue Publishing House,

457
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,310
but I don't even see a punctuation mark.

458
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,770
Teach me. What should I do?

459
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,390
Why are you giving me a salacious smile?

460
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,390
That's good.

461
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,670
It doesn't matter
if you're happy or angry,

462
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,400
as long as you are looking at me.

463
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,790
Are you serious?

464
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,150
You must have been
severely poisoned by Gu Bai Zhi.

465
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,550
What do you mean suits must be black
for important occasions?

466
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,310
This has nothing to do with Gu Bai Zhi.

467
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,230
This one.

468
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,910
Save it.

469
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,030
Lately there have been a lot of talks
about Yun Fei's book.

470
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,890
Didn't you show her some concern?

471
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,790
Firstly, I don't have a position.

472
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,470
Secondly, I don't know anything about it.

473
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,730
I don't have a reason to show her concern.

474
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,670
I've a question.

475
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,950
Deep in your heart,

476
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,990
what does Gu Bai Zhi mean to you?

477
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,550
I'm not at all curious

478
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,030
about your love life.

479
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,150
I just felt that

480
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,430
your relationship with her
seems to have improved.

481
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,670
You can be friends.

482
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,190
But if you're thinking of
getting back together,

483
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,270
I think you should save yourself the pain.

484
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,870
If not, history is just going to
repeat itself.

485
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,190
Then why did you let me
send her back that day?

486
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,990
That's because you had your eyes
on the wrong person.

487
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,550
So you're taking revenge on me?

488
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,280
If I want to take revenge on you,

489
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,110
I'll make you wear this.

[Dark Moments, A Suspense Film Seminar
Speaker: Jiang Yu Cheng]

491
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,670
Many readers will be here.

492
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,510
These seats will all be full.

493
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,580
I've never expected that our boss

494
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,100
will hold a seminar in his own bookstore.

495
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,540
Ah Xiang.

496
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,070
Let me help you.

497
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,510
Excuse me, intern.

498
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,030
Can you not

499
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,060
sit here leisurely?

500
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,910
Go do something.

501
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,590
For example, check on Mr Jiang
to see when he'll be here.

502
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,350
I don't need you to tell me.

Quick. Get out.

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,790
Hurry up.

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,020

I'm driving.

525
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,430
I have to cut you off.

526
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,390
I've called the cops.

527
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,150
I'll not take this further
if you leave within three minutes.

528
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,350
Xin Dun Books threatened authors

529
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,630
and forced the publication
of uncompleted stories.

530
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,670
How dare you!

531
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,030
Do you know how much effort

532
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,060
Yun Fei put into this book?

533
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,590
Why are you so irresponsible?

534
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,630

535
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,790

please submit your feedback online.

539

Authors are not movie stars.

540
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,580
Don't act like a fan club.

541
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,110
You oppressed authors with ill intention

542
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,350
and cheated the money from book fans.

543
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,150
We have the right to voice out.

544
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,190
That's right.

545
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,650
I'll look into the matter.

546
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,830
You can't leave.

547
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,750
What are you doing?

548
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,350
-Give us an answer.
-Let go.

549
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,940
You there. What are you doing?

550
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,910
Are you out of your mind?

551
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,710
Why did you get out of your car?

552
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,310
I didn't expect them to get so worked up.

553
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,910
Are you alright?

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,870
Let's get out of here.

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,110
Jiang Yu Cheng, wake up.

559
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,750
Jiang Yu Cheng.

560
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,900
I'm sorry.

561
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,620
Didn't you say he's near?

562
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,870
It's been an hour.

563
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,950
Where is he?

564
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,630
Something happened.

565
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,390
What?

566
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,120
He didn't pick up.
Something must have happened.

567
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,390
I'll call again.

568
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,430
Chu Li.

569
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,670
Go with the backup plan.

570
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,910
Keep calling him, Mr Zhou Chuan.

571
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,750
And...

572
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,350
Who's the person-in-charge of
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng's book fans?

573
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,030
I'll talk to her.

574
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,790
I'll take you to her.

575
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,670
Alright.

576
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,420
Let's go.

577
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,910
Hello?
Jiang Yu Cheng, where are you?

578
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,750
Gu Bai Zhi?

579
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,870
Alright.

580
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,020
Alright, I got it.

581
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,830
What did she say?

582
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,980
Gu Bai Zhi

583
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,550
was mobbed by Yun Fei's fans.

584
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,790
Jiang Yu Cheng went to
save the damsel in distress.

585
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,230
As he was helping her,

586
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,190
he ended up in the hospital.

587
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,710
Then this...

588
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,900
He...

589
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,750
Everything will be fine.

590
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,310
I'll go to the hospital to check on him.

591
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,750
You take care of the seminar.

592
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,740
Alright.

593
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,430
Jiang Yu Cheng.

594
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,220
Are you dead?

595
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,670
You came right on time.

596
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,950
Let's go. I'll get changed.

597
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,620
Take me to the seminar.

598
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,270
You can't do that.

599
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,750
Although externally

600
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,190
your injury doesn't look serious,

601
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,470
you have to be hospitalized
for further observation.

602
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,230
We must make sure there's no concussion.

603
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,470
Concussion?

604
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,310
I won't have a concussion.

605
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,670
I'm very sober.

606
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,030
Your condition

607
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,340
doesn't allow you to move around.

608
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,510
If you're in a hurry,

609
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,630
quickly complete all the required tests.

610
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,710
Once we confirm that you're fine,

611
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,910
you can leave.

612
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,590
Alright.

613
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,910
Thank you, Doctor.

614
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,030
Thank you.

615
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,350
Did you hear that?

616
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,190
The doctor said you should stay put.

617
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,310
Lie down now.

618
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,510
I told you.

619
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,510
I'm fine. I'll be good after a while.

620
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,990
Is the book important?
Or your life?

621
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,990
Besides, didn't Yuan Yue Publishing House

622
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,150
already decide to
defer your publication plan?

623
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,790
So they can let Role-Playing Game
publish first.

624
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,710
This is just a seminar.

625
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,060
It won't make them come back to life.

626
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,030
Gu Bai Zhi.

627
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,910
You have no business here anymore.

628
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,790
Please go now.

629
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,550
We don't want to
obstruct your path to success.

630
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,950
What she just said

631
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,030
about the deferral
of the publication plan,

632
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,030
is it true?

633
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,100
You knew about it?

634
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,870
I...

635
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,550
You hid this from him?

636
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,310
I don't know anything.

637
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,070
All I know is

638
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,420
Chu Li is now tirelessly

639
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,080
trying to handle your matter.

640
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,060
I also didn't expect that

641
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,460
Yun Fei's readers will be this aggressive.

642
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,610
This is just great.

643
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,230
Jiang Yu Cheng saved
the damsel in distress

644
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,030
and screw up his own business.

645
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,510
Miss Bei, it's me.

646
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,470
Is Director Lu free for a meet-up?

647
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,870
I have a really good story here

648
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,310
to recommend to him.

649
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,790
It's called
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

650
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,940
Have you read it?

651
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,150
If he has no time for a meeting,

652
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,430
I can pay him a visit.

653
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,570
Alright. I'll wait for your call.

654
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,180
Thanks, Miss Bei.

[Heal The Wounded, Save The Dying]

656
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,470
Listen.

657
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,070
This is an honours pennant

658
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,190
specially commissioned
by a reader of Mr Jiang.

659
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,110
Is that so?

660
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,670
It must be you.

661
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,510
Am I not the top reader of Mr Jiang?

662
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,500
Mr Jiang, don't worry.

663
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,580
After the fans heard our explanation

664
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,900
and read the official statement
from Yuan Yue Publishing House,

665
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,510
they expressed their understanding.

666
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,300
Our Moonlight editorial team
also promised them

667
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,310
that attendees of today's seminar

668
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,110
will be given a free copy each

669
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,240
of your new book after it is published.

670
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,150
That is very generous.

671
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,590
I really want to see

672
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,590
how impressive the content is.

673
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,390
Mr Jiang

674
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,950
on his way to the book signing session,

675
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,790
did a good deed

676
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,950
by helping a stranger

677
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,630
who was trapped in the car.

678
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,630
In the end, he sacrificed himself
to save the stranger.

679
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,510
He got injured and had to be taken
to the hospital.

680
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,030
Well, that is all facts.

681
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,830
Your official Weibo

682
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,590
also posted a photo
of the honours pennant.

683
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,470
The caption says

684
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,750
readers present this honours pennant

685
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,620
and vow to stay loyal forever.

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,710
I saw the comments below

688
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,510
are all in support of this.

689
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,550
The crisis management is a success.

690
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,710
Thank you. It's our duty.

691
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,630
You had to handle my mess.

692
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,090
I've really troubled you.

693
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,230
Mr Jiang.

694
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,310
We have come out with a plan.

695
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,350
Please have a look...

696
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,350
Chu Li.

697
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,350
Can you honestly tell me something?

698
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,750
About the seminar,

699
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,310
is it organized

700
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,910
for the smooth publication of
The Disappearing Amusement Park?

701
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,390
I'm sorry, Mr Jiang.

702
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,830
I didn't tell you about it.

703
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,550
Tomorrow,

704
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,430
I'll terminate the contract with
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

705
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,020
As for your promise of free copy
to fans today,

706
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,710
I'll pay for them personally
when the book is published.

707
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,100
Mr Jiang.

708
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,830
People say that

709
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,990
I have a good temper.

710
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,380
They say

711
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,790
I'm a yes man.

712
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,270
I always cooperate with
online merchants and bookstores,

713
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,870
sharing posts of book sales.

714
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,550
Publishing companies asked me to sell

715
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,270
books that are low-quality content
with high selling volume

716
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,670
as a bundle.

717
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,870
I agreed with a smile.

718
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,270
Even if I was reluctant,

719
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,190
I still did it.

720
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,510
It's all because I'm an

721
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,770
outdated author who has fallen
from the tip of the pyramid.

722
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,870
Hence,

723
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,050
The Disappearing Amusement Park

724
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,470
is my last chance.

725
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,100
I understand.

726
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,510
Hence I'll work really hard to make sure

727
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,190
the book is launched this year.

728
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,510
Work hard...

729
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,390
I didn't expect

730
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,270
to fall this low.

731
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,390
Chu Li, since your publishing company

732
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,270
has no confidence in my work,

733
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,300
let's not waste the time of both parties.

734
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,750
No, we're confident.

735
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,140
It's just that
the circulation department is worried...

736
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,340
That's just part of the reason.

737
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,350
You're more worried that

738
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,230
my book will clash dates with
Zhou Chuan's Huang Quan Inn.

739
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,790
Mr Jiang is too smart to a painful extent.

740
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,020
Was he like this when he was younger?

741
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,990
He was more arrogant than me.

742
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,710
Just that the passing years has turned him

743
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,750
into a quiet man.

744
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,390
I can't give up.

745
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,500
I must publish this book for him.

746
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,190
I must witness his glorious return

747
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,710
to the peak of the pyramid.

748
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,220
All those who look down on him

749
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,590
will be speechless.

750
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,990
You're shouting slogans again?

751
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,590
Dealing with someone like him,

752
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,230
you have to let your actions
do the talking.

753
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,910
Do you have a plan in mind?

754
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,390
Gu Bai Zhi tried to recommend him

755
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,590
to top-grossing movie director, Li Yu.

756
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,830
That's a good plan.

757
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,910
Recommend Mr Jiang's story to

758
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,550
top directors like Li Yu.

759
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,990
Then the publishing house
will have to publish

760
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,310
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

761
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,830
But Jiang Yu Cheng harshly rejected Li Yu.

762
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,350
I don't think they have a chance now.

763
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,430
Then...

764
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,870
Can we find other directors?

765
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,070
Directors like Li Yu

766
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,550
is very rare.

767
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,150
Besides, they won't see you.

768
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,410
But we can try this person though.

769
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,310
Are you sure she'll come?

770
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,910
If she doesn't, Jiang Yu Cheng will have
sacrificed for nothing.

771
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,150
This is about Jiang Yu Cheng?

772
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,670
Yes. I...

773
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,270
I'll talk to you.
But you...

774
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,700
Xiao Niao.

775
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,110
The photocopy of
Yi Shui Han's autobiography

776
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,550
will come in today.

777
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,980
So you work on it.
They want it really urgently.

778
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,670
But it's fine.

779
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,390
There are more pictures

780
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,350
than words.

781
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,270
You still have to follow it closely.

782
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,830
Try to pass it to me this week.

783
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,910
He can get it published with priority?

784
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,590
Yes. As long as

785
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,950
all top management sign the deal today,

786
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,110
it can be published.

787
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,430
You have to pass it to me quick.

788
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,160
Alright, Deputy Chief Editor.

789
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,540
Chu Li.

790
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,740
I'm really sorry.

791
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,820
The publication plan of
Jiang Yu Cheng's book

792
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,470
will have to give way to Yi Shui Han.

793
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,790
The crisis at the seminar yesterday

794
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,510
is managed in time,

795
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,350
but we can't do much about it.

796
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,389
The upper management

797
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,830
has their own opinions.

798
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,230
Like I always say,

799
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,830
what is yours will be yours.

800
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,070
If it's not yours, it's no use fighting.

801
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,070
-Good morning, Mr Xia.
-Good morning, Mr Xia.

806
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,469
Come to my office.

807
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,400
Alright, Mr Xia.

808
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,870
That's what happened.

809
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,750
Mr Jiang would never miss the seminar

810
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,909
without reasons.

811
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,110
Moreover, those who came were his readers.

812
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,389
Alright, alright.

813
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,150
I got it.

814
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,989
Mr Xia, is it confirmed that

815
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,670
Yi Shui Han's book will be
given priority for publication?

816
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,870
There's no chance to turn this around?

817
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,950
The upper management

818
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,350
has all agreed.

819
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,830
The documents

820
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,990
will come in today.

821
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,270
This afternoon?

822
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,350
Mr Xia.

823
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,150
Can you give me one more day?

824
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,670
Just one day will do.

825
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,190
This afternoon

826
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,510
I don't think I'll be in the office.

827
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,230
I'll only get to come back

828
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,860
tomorrow evening

829
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,060
to sign that document.

830
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,950
Thank you, Mr Xia.

831
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,630
Jiang Yu Cheng.

832
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,630
You're in.

833
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,170
Listen carefully.
I only say it once.

834
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,230
Chu Li wants me to tell you this.

835
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,270
Give her one more day.

836
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,710
She'll make sure your book
is published as planned.

837
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,590
If she failed,

838
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,630
the problem is her ability.

839
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,310
When you terminate the contract

840
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,310
and sign with another company,

841
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,510
she will have no complaints or regrets.

842
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,220
Alright. I'm done.

843
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,870
Goodbye.

844
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,030
Wait.

845
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,110
But I saw Yi Shui Han
posted the news online

846
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,310
that his autobiography will be published.

847
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,710
Is it all confirmed?

848
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,860
Why did you follow that account?

849
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,470
Can you follow account with quality news?

850
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,700
I don't know anyway.

851
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,950
I only know that
if Chu Li wants me to trust her,

852
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,070
I'll trust her.

853
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,670
But seriously,

854
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,470
terminating the contract
with Yuan Yue Publishing House now

855
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,470
is really not a smart move.

856
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,440
It'll only rage another storm.

857
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,670
My old man has always thought that

858
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,150
I'm not as good as you.

859
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,750
But on some matters,
I'm really not convinced.

860
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,630
I know.

861
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,900
You're now doing better than me,

862
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,390
but I'm still that legendary

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,510
kid next door.

864
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,300
Then let's call it a match.

865
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,940
Trust Chu Li. She'll make sure your book

866
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,740
is published according to plan.

867
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,210
When that time comes,
the match will be real.

868
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,830
Alright. Tell Chu Li

869
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,030
I'll wait for her.

870
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,270
Why am I always the messenger?

871
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,590
I'll send voice mail.

872
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,030
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

Including the extra volumes that were
specially written for publication.

881
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,970
I've printed them into a booklet.

I'll show him the digital copy.

Digital copies may be convenient.

885

But physical book

886
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,190
feels good to hold.

887

Hope we can succeed today

00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,190

to buy the movie rights for

on par with Director Li Yu.

No wonder his works
continuously received big awards.

he'll definitely want it.

929
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,750
Chief Director Gu, if you're tired,

930
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,750
I can drive.

931
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,910
I have a driving license.

932
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,070
Thanks for offering.

933
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,750
A driver who has a license
but never been on the road.

934
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,150
I don't want to

935
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,110
risk our lives.

936
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,230
With our current speed,

937
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,990
how long will it take?

938
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,630
Half an hour if it is smooth.

939
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,990
Great. We'll be in time.

940
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,310
Looks like the heavens
is watching over Mr Jiang.

941
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,750
What happened?

942
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,430
We have a flat tyre.

943
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,990
What?

944
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,980
What should we do?

945
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,430
Let's call the helpline.

946
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,960
We don't have time for that.

947
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,630
Use the spare tyre.

948
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,110
Let me do it. Let me do it.

949
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,840
You use your driving skill.
I'll use my strength.

950
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,790
Don't act tough.

951
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,630
You'll turn into
the guy you're looking for.

952
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,910
Let me do it.

953
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,470
I think we should do it together.

954
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,430
Alright.

955
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,990
Amazing.

956
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,190
We can still make it.

957
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,150
We'll reach in five minutes.

958
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,510
Miss Bei, we'll reach
Linzhou Airport very soon.

959
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,270
Where are you?

960
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,150
[We've passed the security checks.]

961
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,830
[Why don't we reschedule
the meeting to next month?]

962
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,350
Alright. Have a safe flight.

963
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,190
They've entered the boarding area?

964
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,230
What should we do?

965
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,490
We won't make it
if we don't do this today.

966
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,870
I've waited for Chu Li.

967
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,150
One day.

968
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,420
24 hours.

969
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,150
If she asked you to wait for a day,

970
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,390
why can't you wait for a second day?

971
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,720
That idiot is still rushing about for you.

972
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,990
You get her to come back then.

973
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,870
Don't tire herself out.

974
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,730
My heart aches for her too.

975
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,990
Don't you dare.

976
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,110
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng.

977
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,310
Thank you for coming in today.

978
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,990
I know you're here

979
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,250
to talk about the contract termination.

980
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,510
We're really sorry

981
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,470
that our plan affected you.

982
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,190
I can understand

983
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,510
your concerns.

984
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,670
Hence I won't make it hard on you

985
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,800
about the contract termination.

986
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,830
Before we terminate our contract,

987
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,290
I want you to meet someone.

988
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,030
Let's not do this.

989
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,990
I've made up my mind.

990
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,810
Chief Editor Yu, Director Lu is here.

991
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,510
Please come in, Director Lu.

992
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,070
I trust you know that

993
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,070
this is the famous Director Lu Fang.

994
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,150
Hi, Director Lu Fang.

995
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,110
It's an honour to meet you.

996
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,070
Same here.

997
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,310
We'll leave you two to discuss further.

998
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,110
Please take a seat, Director Lu.

999
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,190
You too.

1000
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,660
Mr Jiang.

1001
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,670
I finally get to meet you in person.

1002
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,600
Why do you suddenly have a cold?

1003
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,770
You didn't come home the whole night.

1004
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:11,590
Well...

1005
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,190
I was too exhausted last night.

1006
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,520
Thank you for your concern, Mr Zhou Chuan.

1007
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,880
What are you typing?

1008
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,190
An official publication statement

1009
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,830
of The Disappearing Amusement Park

1010
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,290
on our official platform.

1011
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,470
Didn't we confirm that we'll publish

1012
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,390
Yi Shui Han's book first?

1013
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,430
Why are we changing again?

1014
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,870
I'm sorry, Deputy Editor Miao.

1015
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,950
Director Lu Fang has decided
to make a film

1016
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,270
for The Disappearing Amusement Park.

1017
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,150
He just signed the film rights
licensing agreement with Mr Jiang.

1018
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,510
Shooting is estimated
to be within this year.

1019
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,060
Mr Xia has told the upper management

1020
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,430
about this great news.

1021
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,830
The upper management wants

1022
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,310
this book to be published with priority.

1023
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,510
Hence, if it is not yours,

1024
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,950
it's no use fighting.

1025
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,550
Chu Li, do you really think

1026
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,030
I can't do anything about you?

1027
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,950
What do you want to do?

1028
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,540
What happened?

1029
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,000
Why are you standing here?

1030
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,350
I feel so sleepy.

1031
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,460
I'm going to get some coffee.
