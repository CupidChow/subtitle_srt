[Episode 29]

4
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,479
I'm here to discuss about
Huang Quan Inn's extra copies.

5
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,150
Why is he here?

6
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,630
I forgot that we were supposed to
have a meal with him today.

7
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,420
You should join us since you're here.

8
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,180
You can take a look

9
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,789
at this letter of authorization.

10
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,190
Just send it to Xin Dun Books
once you're done signing it.

11
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,030
I'll skip the meal.

12
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,390
Ms Gu, don't leave in such a hurry.

13
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,270
We need to discuss about
the letter of authorization.

14
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,600
I need to understand the details clearly.

15
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,870
Ms Gu, it's late already.

16
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,630
It would be great for us to have dinner
together while discussing this.

17
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,150
You came at a great timing.

18
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,350
Mr Jiang brought us a lot of hairy crabs.

19
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,750
They're female crabs as well.
I'm sure you'll love them.

20
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,070
Later, you should observe my movement.

21
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,030
Let's give them a strong dose.

22
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,070
Later, no matter
which one of them is drunk,

23
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,590
we'll ask the other party
to take care of the drunk one.

24
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,510
Only then, we'll be able to
create chances for them.

25
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,620
Understood?

26
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,790
But, Ms Gu seems like a good drinker.

27
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,030
Will you be able to handle her?

28
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,030
Are you kidding me?

29
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,110
Have I ever been drunk in front of you?

30
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,430
Let's go.

The wind from Peony Pavilion

32
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,510
was as cold as tonight's breeze.

33
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,670
That's all he can drink?

34
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,070
And he wants to drink with me?

35
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,710
Mr Zhou Chuan, please get down.

36
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,230

37
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,430
is that you?

38
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,990
No.

39
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,700
I'm not Li Niang.

40
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,390
I won't speak with you then.

42
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,470
Do you still remember that

43
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,930
we played house together
when we were young?

44
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,190
You pretended to be Xu Xian,

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,910
while I pretended to be Bai Su Zhen,

46
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,110
yet you insisted on marrying
the girl who pretended to be Fa Hai

47
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,829
three times instead of marrying me.

48
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,420
After that, I got angry.

49
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,710
I wanted you to
act according to the script.

50
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,040
Do you remember what you said? You said...

51
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,470
You said you liked Fa Hai! You...

52
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,590
You!

53
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,390
I'll tell everyone about it even if
you choke me to death!

54
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,030
Shut up!

55
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,350
When you were young, you said

56
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,350
you loved Fa Hai. Now, you love Ms Bai.

57
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,430
Why are you doing this?

58
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,390
Ms Bai,

59
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,350
he cried numerous times
in secret because of you.

60
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,190
He's drunk. Don't listen to him.

61
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,540
No!

62
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,870
I have evidence.

63
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,470
Let me show you

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,310
-the times he cried.
-Zhou Chuan!

65
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,830

66
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,310

68
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,430
Dear, he's screaming at me!

69
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,140
He was so loud. My head hurts.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,350
I'm unfit to speak with you. Go away.

71

74
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
What? Do you want me to give you a hug?

75
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,590
There's no need for that.

76
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,180
I just want to ask you something.

77
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,470
How is Chen Jun Xiong's

78
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,750
nose?

79
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,390
Who's Chen Jun Xiong?

80
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,990
He's a writer.

81
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,750
Back then, Chen Jun Xiong was
defaming him following the same route.

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,830
And she saw it for herself.

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,270
It was my first time

84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,590
witnessing a woman beating up a man
on that summer.

85
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,340
And his nose gushed out with bleed,

86
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,350
just like what we see in comics.

87
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,500
That's much better than
Jiang Yu Cheng's crying.

88
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,270
Can you stop staring at me?

89
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,220
This is awkward for me as well.

90
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,060
You two actually love each other,
but why...

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,750
I'll leave now.

92

deal with him alone, right?

What's huge?

168
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,430
The wine cabinet is huge.

169
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,630
I do drink red wine

you can hold your liquor.

I think the wine cabinet

175
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,030
has a special shape to it.

176

We're here to interview Mr Zhou Chuan,

177
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,830

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,790
Chief Editor Yu,

185
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,310
do you think we need to continue
our interview

186
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,790
with the wine cabinet?

187
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,190
Why are you hiding here again?

188
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,310
Why are you looking for me?

189
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,030
Go outside and deal with them.

190
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,150
Hurry up.

191
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,110
Why are you still here? Hurry up!

192
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,830
Why are you doing this again?

193
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,390
I wanted to do this since the last time

194
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,750
you were hiding in here.

195
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,150
Let's go.

196
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,780
Why should I go?

197
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,830
Let's announce

198
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,630
our relationship to them officially.

199
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,510
Let's go.

200
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,190
Mr Zhou Chuan, I'm sorry

201
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,310
for the interruption.

202
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,570
Because Chu Li is not with us today, we...

203
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,470
She's over here.

204
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,980
Chu...

205
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,580
Chu Li, you...

206
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,780
She was always here.

207
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,470
I'm staying on the upper floor
of Mr Zhou Chuan's house.

208
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,790
My wage was deducted back then.

209
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,430
I couldn't afford to pay my rent.

210
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,340
That's why Mr Zhou Chuan is
renting his room to me.

211
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,660
I have to clean the house and
bring his dog for a walk.

212
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,390
But I did pay my rent on time.

213
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,990
And...

214
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,630
Now, she's my girlfriend.

215
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,430
We're a couple.

216
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,560
That's pretty good.

217
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,310
It's fine.

218
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,350
As long as it doesn't concern the benefit

219
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,390
of the company, writers, and editors,

220
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,310
we won't interfere with your
personal relationships.

221
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,670
This is really good to see.

222
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,730
Congratulations.

223
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,150
Thank you.

224
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,580
Chu Li,

225
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,670
I can finally

226
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,710
tell everyone the truth.

227
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,550
[I'll go to your place tonight.]

228
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,750
[Alright.]

229
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,550
Hello, Mum?

230
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,550
[My son,]

231
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,580
[congratulations for the nomination.]

232
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,310
[I'm really happy for you.]

233
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,990
Only one of his books was nominated.

234
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,790
There's nothing to be proud of.

235
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,420
[You can be happy for him]

236
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,150
when he wins the award.

237
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,150
Mum,

238
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,820
if I do win the award,

239
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,950
I'm sure Old Zhou will be frustrated.

240
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,600
Why should I be frustrated?

241
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,690
I don't have the time to deal with you.

242
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,910
[You better shut up.]

243
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,190
My son, I wasn't referring to you.

244
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,270
[I have a gift ready for you]

245
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,190
[in a few days.]

246
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,870
Just wait for it, okay?

247
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,150
Alright, I'll hang up now.

248
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,790
You insisted on butting in
when I said I was calling our son.

249
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,550
If you want me to turn the speaker on,
then please don’t interrupt.

250
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,750
You were so rude just now.

251
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,230
I just want to remind him

252
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,590
not to be arrogant just because
his work was nominated.

253
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,520
There's nothing to be happy about.

254
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,750
Nothing to be happy about?

255
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
So, what were you thinking

256
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,250
when you were writing down his good news?

257
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,910
I was just practising my calligraphy.

258
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,370
It has nothing to do
with the content I write.

259
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,550
What about this pen

260
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,030
you told Mr Chen to make for you?

261
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,860
Is it for your son?

262
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,710
Who said I'm giving it to him?

263
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,350
It's for my own use.

264
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,510
You're still acting stubborn?

265
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,710
Mr Chen called me and told me that

266
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,110
our son's name was engraved on the pen.

267
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,350
Look.

268
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,830
Let me answer a call.

269
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,910
Hello?

270
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,710
Li?

271
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,150
Yes.

272
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,070
My son was actually nominated.

273
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,430
I didn't expect that either.

274
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,710
It was quite embarrassing actually.

275
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,440
I didn't think he was good enough
to be nominated.

276
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,900
Hello?

277
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,790
[Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan?]

278
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,510
Are you free this afternoon?

279
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,950
Sis Xi Xi wishes to discuss about
our collaboration.

280
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,340
Alright, send me your address.

281
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,390
Okay.

282
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,910
Jiang Yu Cheng, are you free?

283
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,470
Accompany me to meet Song Xi.

284
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,750
You want me to accompany you for that?
Do you know how old you are?

285
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,540
When will you be able to
do things by yourself?

286
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,590
I wouldn't have called you
if Chu Li was free.

287
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,310
The main thing is
we're meeting in a hotel.

288
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,950
I don't think
it's suitable for me to go there alone.

289
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,230
What? Are you afraid that
Chu Li might get jealous?

290
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,760
I'm afraid she'll chase me
with a knife again.

291
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,550
You can just reject Song Xi then.

292
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,700
You can change to another venue.

293
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,230
You think I didn't try that?

294
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,320
I called her when I saw the address.

295
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,550
But her assistant kept coming up

296
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,750
with numerous reasons

297
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,750
and insisted that the hotel
is the best place for us to meet.

298
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,610
I don't know how to deal with that.

299
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,200
Just stop thinking about it and follow me.

300
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,880
-Xiao Bai, look after the shop.
-Alright.

301
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,020
Mr Zhou Chuan.

302
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,349
This is?

303
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,329
Hello, I'm Jiang Yu Cheng.

304
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,310
Nice to meet you.

305
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,310
I'm Sis Xi Xi's assistant.

306
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,829
You can call me Na Na.

307
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,790
Please enter.

308
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,070
Are you the author of
The Disappearing Series,

309
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,470
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

310
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,290
Just call me by my name.
No need for formalities.

311
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,870
Paparazzi tend to follow Sis Xi Xi around.

313
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,130
That's why we always close the curtains.

314
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,430
Where is she?

315
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,350
Sorry, gentlemen.

316
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,030
Sis Xi Xi's dog was sick.

317
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,230
She's rushing back
from the hospital right now.

318
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,390
Please have a seat for now.

319
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,190
Please wait a moment.

320
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,630
[They've arrived.]

321
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,060
[Na Na]

322
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,640
[Song Xi]

323
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,150
[Just wait.]

324
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,990
[Ah Xiang is such a blabbermouth.]

325
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,750
[She told Li Xian Yu about
what happened this morning.]

326
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,700
[Now, the entire company]

327
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,020
[knows that we're in a relationship.]

328
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,190
[Even the finance department
knows about it.]

329
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,210
[Chu Li]

330
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,700
Hey, I know you're chatting with someone,

331
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,500
but what's with the silly smile?

332
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,710
This is how it feels to be in love.

333
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,840
Single dogs like you
will never understand my feelings.

334
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,510
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

335
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,430
[Isn't that great?]

336
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,890
[I can finally send you to work
officially.]

337
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,340
[What do you want to eat?]

338
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,070
[I plan to buy
some ingredients after work.]

339
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,080
[Chu Li]

340
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,190
[Little Monkey]

341
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,510
[I want dumplings.]

342
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,810
[Zhou Chuan]

343
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,190
Hey, why isn't she here yet?

344
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,310
Look at the time.
I still have things to do at night.

345
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,630
Where's her assistant?

346
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,510
Why did she disappear after
she went in to make the call?

347
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,440
What event do you have for tonight?

348
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,910
Must I tell you?

349
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,700
Seems like it has something to do
with Gu Bai Zhi then.

350
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
You always try to hide things from me

351
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,370
whenever it concerns her.

352
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,910
Let me open the door.

353
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,630
Sis Xi Xi,

354
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,510
is Lucky alright?

355
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,310
He's fine.

356
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,950
Sorry for the long wait.

357
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,030
Ms Song, tonight, we...

358
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,070
Sis Xi Xi,

359
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,950
how's Lucky?

360
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,790
He went for an operation.

361
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,720
Lucky has been with me
for almost 15 years.

362
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,990
Honestly speaking,

363
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,870
it never occurred to me that

364
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,860
he might leave me one day.

365
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,260
The vet said he wouldn't be able to
survive for long

366
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,760
even though he went for the operation.

367
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,150
All of them

368
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,430
were nonchalant about my dog's condition.

369
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,910
They said it's fine
even if he passes away.

370
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,640
They told me to get another dog.

371
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,100
But, to me, Lucky

372
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,110
is my only kin.

373
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,310
I'm sure Lucky couldn't
bear to leave you as well.

374
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,440
I'm sure he won't leave us that easily.

375
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,270
Ms Song,

376
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,590
it's like this.

377
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,630
I can see that
you're not in a good mood today.

378
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,670
We shouldn't bother you right now.

379
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,470
Let's talk about
our collaboration next time.

380
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,270
Sorry for this.

381
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,030
They...

382
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,230
Maybe they have an emergency to attend to.

383
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,470
Xue Mei.

384
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,310
I told you to call me Song Xi!

385
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,710
Don't you understand me?

386
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,350
Sorry, Xi Xi.

387
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,710
Don't be angry.

388
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,150
You're not sympathizing

389
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,150
with her at all.

390
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,790
She's quite beautiful

391
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,190
And her tears were pouring out.

392
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,710
Yet, you didn't even offer her
any consolation.

393
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,750
Is she beautiful?

394
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,070
I don't think so?

395
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,400
I think Chu Li
looked much better than her.

396
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,190
I almost

397
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,310
had goosebumps

398
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,510
from her poor acting.

399
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,390
Honestly speaking,

400
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,470
you own a dog as well.

401
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,030
Will you sympathize with her

402
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,870
because of that fact?

403
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,500
Do I think I'm that free?

404
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,190
She's used to acting.

405
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,270
She's acting in every moment of her life.

406
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,100
Don't tell me you were touched
by her acting?

407
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,990
Me?

408
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,470
I don't have a dog.

409
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,590
It's useless even if she does
mention her dog to me.

410
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,030
That's good to hear.

411
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,030
Initially, I thought she was diligent

412
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,690
as she had read all of my books.

413
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,220
Now that I think about it,

414
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,480
I think I have to reconsider my decision.

415
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,630
Why are you walking so fast?

416
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,500
You were the one who picked up the pace.

417
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,150
Gu Bai Zhi said she's going to
review the script with me later.

418
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,140
My girlfriend is almost home as well.

419
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,460
I need to rush back.

420
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,550
This is bad!

421
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,390
Do we need to hide this news?

422
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,550
No need.

423
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,200
Let everyone know about it.

424
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,270
Hello, Ah Xiang?

425
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,030
Who?

426
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,230
Zhou Chuan and Song Xi?

427
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,550
My scandal is on the trending searches?
Are you joking with me?

428
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,030
[You better look out for yourself.]

429
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,350
[Maybe I'll see you]

430
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,080
[when you're buried in the
mass grave next time.]

431
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,500
[Song Xi's relationship revealed,
Song Xi, Zhou Chuan]

432
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,910
[According to the netizens,
Song Xi's boyfriend]

433
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,630
[is the young and
famous writer, Zhou Chuan.]

434
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,390
[Is Song Xi the one he confessed to]

435
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,350
[on Weibo last time?]

436
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,910
[I don't believe in this rumour.]

437
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,570
[I expect great things from
Song Xi's new show.]

438
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,820
[Double delight!]

439
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,190
[How dare you steal my Chuan from me?]

440
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,070
Look, today is...

441
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,630
What's wrong?

442
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,270
Nothing...

443
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,470
Nothing's wrong.

444
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,550
The moon is pretty round tonight.

445
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,590
Is that so?

446
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,430
What are you doing?

447
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,220
You said you wanted dumplings, right?

448
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,950
Why don't you put down the cleaver first?

449
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,550
I have something to tell you.

450
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,270
Are you talking about the scandal
between you and Song Xi?

451
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,990
You knew about it?

452
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,550
It's the top result
on the trending searches, you know?

453
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,150
How could I not know about it?

454
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,910
Please have mercy!

455
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,550
Put down the cleaver first.

456
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,030
Jiang Yu Cheng was with me
when I went to

457
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,430
find her today.

458
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,470
But I don't know

459
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,670
why they didn't take pictures
of Jiang Yu Cheng.

460
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,630
Nothing happened between us.

461
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,920
I swear I didn't betray you.

462
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,310
Aren't you tired from all the speaking?

463
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,430
Have some water.

464
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,930
[Don't tell me she's going to murder me?]

465
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,000
No thanks. I'm not thirsty.

466
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,430
Just drink it. I didn't poison it.

467
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,470
But, honestly speaking,

468
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,670
I didn't manage to speak with her today.

469
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,910
Something was wrong with her dog.

470
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,670
Jiang Yu Cheng and I waited for her
in the hotel for the whole afternoon.

471
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,390
You can ask Jiang Yu Cheng
if you don't believe me.

472
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,710
She has a dog as well?

473
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,310
That means you guys
are speaking the same language.

474
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,990
That's great.

475
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,390
Which part of it is great?

476
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,230
Plenty of people have dogs as well.

477
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,590
I'm speaking the same language as them.

478
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,130
Er Gou will get jealous as well, you know?

479
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,920
Why are you explaining yourself to me?

480
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,470
There's really nothing between us.

481
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,710
Believe me.

482
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,030
Are you angry at me or not?

483
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,460
Why should I be angry at you?

484
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,630
They're just building hype
for the new show's launching.

485
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,870
I'm very rational.

486
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,300
How could I believe in those rumours?

487
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,620
You almost scared me to death.

488
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,670
This isn't right.

489
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,150
Are you really not jealous of her?

490
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,660
Why should I be jealous of her?

491
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,910
Don't tell me there's something
between you two?

492
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,060
Not at all!

493
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,910
That settles it.

494
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,070
This isn't right at all.

495
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,830
Are you really not jealous of her at all?

496
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,430
Even Er Gou is jealous, you know?
Why aren't you jealous?

497
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,470
This is just a joke.

498
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,910
Why should I be jealous about it?

499
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,900
Do you think I'm that petty?

500
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,670
Stop overthinking.

501
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,800
Go and wash the Chinese cabbage for me.

502
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,190
What do you want me to say?

503
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,310
I don't want

504
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,950
Qiu Qiu to live

505
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,000
in a single-parent family
when he's that young.

506
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,990
There's no difference at all
since his mother isn't there for him.

507
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,260
You've never cared for this family.

508
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,470
Don't you think it's pointless for us

509
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,550
to continue this?

510
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,670
Li Wei,

511
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,670
my mother and I

512
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,670
were the ones who had been
taking care of the family

513
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,200
and Qiu Qiu all these years.

514
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,630
Now,

515
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,950
you're turning your back on us?

516
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,150
Do you think that's suitable?

517
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,410
What do you mean by
turning my back on you?

518
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,870
Don't you think that's rude of you?

519
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,670
Yu Yao,

520
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,830
I've been sending money

521
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,630
to the family

522
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,590
every month,

523
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,510
am I right?

524
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,590
You think money can solve everything?

525
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,710
Why don't you get yourself
a babysitter then?

526
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,070
Why are you looking for a wife?

527
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,950
Alright.

528
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,010
I don't wish to argue with you.

529
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,800
I just want to ask you this.

530
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,710
Are we

531
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,400
having this divorce or not?

532
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,950
Li Wei,

533
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,670
you better don't be too much.

534
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,980
I'm being too much?

535
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,790
I've worked so hard in order
to support the family.

536
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,720
I just want you to stay home
and take care of the child.

537
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,390
How am I being too much?

538
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,710
Why aren't you

539
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,850
taking care of the child then?

540
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,790
Your meagre wage isn't enough
for our family at all.

541
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,750
Do you think your meagre wage
is enough to sustain the family

542
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,310
if I didn't go to work?

543
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,790
Now, I don't expect you
to support the family.

544
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,390
I just want you to stay home
and take care of our child.

545
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,650
That's not too much to ask for,
am I right?

546
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,870
Yu Yao, what do you mean by this?

547
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,060
We can

548
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,150
go through the divorce,

549
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,210
but it's impossible for me
to hand over the child to you.

550
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,470
Although I'm not a perfect mother,

551
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,510
at least I can complete my duties.

552
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,590
And you,

553
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,910
I don't believe that you'll be able to
take good care of Qiu Qiu.

554
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,430
You want to steal him from me?

555
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,030
You better think carefully.

556
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,870
If you insist on taking him away,

557
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,790
I'll see you in court then.

558
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,790
The things I've mentioned just now,

559
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,830
they need some adjustments.

560
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,490
Change them when you get back.

561
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,340
Why are you staring at me?

562
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
Did you hear what I've said just now?

563
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,790
I did.

564
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,110
I just feel that

565
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,110
it's been a long time since I saw you.

566
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,750
I don't think so.

567
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,310
Don't you feel that

568
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,030
our session today

569
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,600
is very harmonious?

570
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,230
It reminds me of the days when

571
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,200
we were doing
The Disappearing Zoo together.

572
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,980
I love this chapter,

573
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,110
The Death of the Elephant.

574
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,790
But some of the descriptions
are too obvious.

575
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,120
I think you can alter
the mood a little bit.

576
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,710
Hello, are you listening to me?

577
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,230
You've been nagging me for the entire day.

578
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,630
Stop it already. Take a break.

579
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,510
No!

580
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,910
I want to read the ending.

581
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,270
I want to read the ending.

582
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,750
Let me tell you about the ending then.

583
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,910
-The culprit is...
-Hey, don't spoil it for me.

584
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,810
Who's better-looking? The script or me?

585
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,630
The script.

586
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,150
Seems like I can only do something else

587
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,790
in order to attract your attention.

588
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,950
That's it for today.

589
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,060
I'll leave now.

590
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,190
We aren't done with the script yet.

591
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,650
We can continue tomorrow.

592
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,840
Let me treat you to dinner then.

593
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,540
No thanks, I have an appointment.

594
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,150
Let me see you off then.

595
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,630
See you tomorrow.

596
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,010
[Closed]

597
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,550
Can I stay here for two days?

598
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,460
Of course.

599
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,630
Song Xi finally clarified the rumours.

600
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,960
It would be strange if she didn't do so.

601
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,150
The key is, she said she's going to
collaborate with you

602
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,390
for your novel, The Book of Luo He God.

603
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,030
Is she out of her mind?

604
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,670
She's trying to drive a duck onto a perch.

605
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,220
I didn't say I was going to
sell the novel to her.

606
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,910
How did the discussion go for you guys?

607
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,170
It's nothing special.

608
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,700
But I think she's being
quite sincere about it.

609
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,140
And many people on Weibo

610
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,710
state that they're excited
for the cooperation.

611
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,390
Why is someone still saying that
I've sent the script to her?

612
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,830
No, I need to clarify this.

613
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,430
-No!
-Why?

614
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,510
You can't just post something
without thinking twice.

615
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,870
You'll only make things worse.

616
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,220
I've read the posts.

617
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,670
I'm sure someone paid them
to write all those articles.

618
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,550
They're just trying to
boost their business.

619
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,550
According to my guess,

620
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,350
it's either Song Xi who's doing it

621
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,870
in order to build hype
for The Book of Luo He God,

622
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,790
or Song Xi's rival who's doing it

623
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,270
in order to mess with her.

624
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,150
You should ignore them.

625
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,270
It'll be over after a few days.

626
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,270
Don't be unhappy.
You should be optimistic.

627
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,750
That way, more people will know about you.

628
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,630
Because of a scandal?

629
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,270
I won't be happy about that.

630
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,310
Mister, do you know that

631
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,590
some writers have been writing
all their lives,

632
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,350
but no one has read their books

633
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,110
just because they're relatively unknown
to the world.

634
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,750
Although many people might get to know you

635
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,700
because of this scandal,

636
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,430
I believe that once they read your books,

637
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,950
they will forget about the scandal.

638
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,830
Instead, they'll remember the words

639
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,670
and the world you had created.

640
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,940
I'm just

641
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,230
afraid that you might be upset.

642
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,070
Why should I be upset?

643
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,030
Now, more people will
know about your novels.

644
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,980
As your editor,

645
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,590
I'm elated.

646
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,590
Besides,

647
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,670
you're mine.

648
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,190
No one can steal you away from me.

649
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,510
You're that confident in yourself?

650
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,429
I'm confident in you.

651
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,310
Look at you.

652
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,469
But, why are you so familiar

653
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,150
with what

654
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,310
they're doing?

655
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,429
Back then, I was an avid reader
of Mr Jiang's works.

656
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,070
I was considered as
a member of his fan club as well.

657
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,670
That's why I'm familiar with their tricks.

658
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,230
Even a person like him has a fan club?

659
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,429
How is that a fan club when there
are only ten members? I...

660
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,190
Who is this?

661
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,380
Why aren't you answering it?

662
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,239
Maybe someone is calling you
with their new number.

663
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,230
Alright then.

664
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,310
Hello, who is this?

665
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,110
[Hello?]

666
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,030
[Is this Mr Zhou Chuan?]

667
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,110
I'm Song Xi.

668
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,950
Song Xi?

669
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,110
Do you need anything from me?

670
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,260
I'm sorry for the scandal.

671
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,510
[I didn't expect someone
to take pictures of us.]

672
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,870
[Sorry for the trouble.]

673
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,790
It's pretty troublesome,

674
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,550
but I can endure the trouble.

675
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,680
[Mr Zhou, you're such a joker.]

676
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,870
I'm calling you

677
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,790
because I want to apologize to you.

678
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,990
[And I want to take this chance]

679
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,390
[to invite you for a meal]

680
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,150
[so that we can discuss about
our collaboration.]

681
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,990
I...

682
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,470
Alright.

683
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,270
But I'm busy these few days.

684
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,730
We can talk about it later.

685
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,350
Why aren't you discussing it
with her in person?

686
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,550
It's pretty tiring to talk to her.

687
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,190
Besides,

688
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,450
I need to work on Maurer's script as well.

689
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,150
If Song Xi knew
you detested her that much,

690
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,140
I'm sure she'll call off
the collaboration.

691
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,830
Call it off then. I couldn't care less.

692
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,390
You don't want your phone?

693
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,270
Why should I when I'm just
returning to my room?

694
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,190
Interesting.

695
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,550
He wants me to wait for his call.

696
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,510
What does he mean by that?

697
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,550
He did it on purpose.

698
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,650
This is great news.

699
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,950
Xi Xi, I don't understand at all.

700
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,110
How is this a good thing?

701
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,950
He saw through my trick.

702
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,750
He knew I was trying to
leave him hanging last time.

703
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,030
This time, he's giving me

704
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,750
a taste of my medicine.

705
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,350
But this means that he cares about me.

706
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,100
He's still as intelligent as always.

707
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,180
Fine.

708
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,990
I'll listen to him.

709
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,350
I'll wait for him.

710
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,910
Chu Li,

711
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,830
did anything happen between you
and Mr Zhou Chuan last night?

712
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,070
Last night?

713
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,430
Are you referring to the incident
with Song Xi?

714
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,750
Listen, Mr Zhou Chuan

715
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,590
will never betray you.

716
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,030
Xiao Niao, have you checked Weibo out?

717
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,750
Yeah.

718
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,310
I was shocked when I saw
the trending searches.

719
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,460
I told you already.

720
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,590
Zhou Chuan

721
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,950
is incredibly arrogant.

722
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,830
How could he possibly fall for her?

723
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,790
Chu Li, it's just a random chat.

724
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,150
Please don't mind us.

725
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,550
The rumours are fake.

726
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,880
Please don't mind them.

727
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,390
Why do I feel like

728
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,070
you guys mind the rumours more than me?

729
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,230
Why should I mind it when

730
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,380
I'm not in a relationship with
Mr Zhou Chuan?

731
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,190
Why are you trying to console me then?

732
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,990
Are we familiar with each other?

733
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,630
Are you guys here just to chat?

734
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,430
You think you don't need to work?

735
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,990
Continue with your work.

736
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,270
[Why should I mind it?]

737
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,510
[The rumours are fake anyway.]

738
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,430
I guess the people outside
are celebrating...

739
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,890
Please wait a moment.
I need to answer a call.

740
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,950
Hello?

741
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,380
I understand. You guys
can call the cops first.

742
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,110
I'll look for her immediately.

743
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,660
Call the cops? What's wrong?

744
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,870
The nursing home
said Ms Liu is missing.

745
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,110
I need to look for her.

746
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,030
Calm down for now.

747
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,330
Think about the places
she used to frequent in the past.

748
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,460
Zhijiang Park?

749
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,660
Mr Lin and Ms Liu

750
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,190
used to frequent that park.

751
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,150
Let's go together.

752
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,190
Ms Liu!

753
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,550
Ms Liu!

754
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,270
Ms Liu!

755
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,470
Ms Liu!

756
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,630
Ms Liu!

757
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,110
Ms Liu!

758
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,990
Ms Liu!

759
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,140
Ms Liu!

760
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,710
Ms Liu!

761
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,740
Ms Liu, why are you here?

762
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,510
You are?

763
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,590
I'm Bai Zhi.

764
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,630
Bai Zhi?

765
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,150
Yeah, Ms Liu.

766
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,620
She's Gu Bai Zhi.

767
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,500
Bai Zhi?

768
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,670
I'm sorry.

769
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,550
I'm an old woman now.

770
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,630
My memories are failing me.

771
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,670
It's fine.

772
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,000
Just forget about it
if you can't remember anything.

773
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,430
Lin?

774
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,030
Lin!

775
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,750
-Ms Liu, he isn't...
-Lin?

776
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,510
I knew you would come for me

777
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,110
if I wait here for you.

778
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,950
Yeah, it's me.

779
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,390
It's windy here.

780
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,590
Let's go back.

781
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,990
Let's wait for a little longer.

782
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,110
The sky is getting dark.

783
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,110
The stars will come out soon.

784
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,680
We won't be able to see them
even when night falls.

785
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,070
Let's go.

786
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,630
Let's have dinner first.

787
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,790
We'll come back

788
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,590
when the weather is great, okay?

789
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,110
Lin,

790
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,420
these are the letters you wrote for me
back then.

791
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,110
I took them out and read them,

792
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,550
but I didn't keep them well.

793
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,550
In the end, the cat tore them apart.

794
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,070
That's why they're in this state.

795
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,750
It's all my fault.

796
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,990
It's fine.

797
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,820
I'll fix it for you.

798
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,580
Really?

799
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,870
I promise you.

800
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,980
Come, let's return home.

801
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,470
Alright.

802
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,150
Here.

803
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,830
Will you be able to restore the letters?

804
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,630
These letters are ancient.

805
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,350
And they were torn apart
by the cat as well.

806
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,680
It's an arduous task,
but I'll try my best.

807
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,030
They wrote letters

808
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,950
to each other

809
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,810
when they were in a relationship.

810
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,900
Back then, one of them was in Shanghai

811
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,550
while the other person was in Xinjiang,
helping with the country's development.

812
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,790
Writing letters was the only way
they could keep in contact.

813
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,700
After Mr Lin's passing,

814
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,480
the letters act as a sort
of emotional support to her.

815
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,190
Don't worry.

816
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,950
I will surely restore them.

817
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,510
Thank you.

818
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,780
You should wear this
when you visit her next time.

819
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,470
We made her a promise.

820
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,550
I will surely cherish it.

821
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,680
You need to return it to me
once you're done, you know?

822
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,790
Alright.

823
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,350
You should leave first.

824
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,880
I'll stay here with Ms Liu
for a little longer.

825
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,870
Alright.

826
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,270
Call me if you need anything.
