[Episode 4]

4
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,550
Mr Zhou Chuan.

5
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,229
Why don't

6
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,990
you ice the injury?

7
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,100
I've delivered the agreement to you,

8
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,300
haven't I?

9
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,990
Why are you here?

10
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,750
Didn't you promise to send it
to me in the afternoon?

11
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,350
I've been waiting but I didn't get it.

12
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,800
I couldn't reach you
as your phone was off.

13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,470
That's why I came here.

14
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,230
I'm not in the mood.

15
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,720
I'll do it tomorrow.

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,950
Are you not in a good mood?

17
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,990
Just leave if there's nothing else.

18
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,510
You're having a flu. Stop drinking.

19
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,430
It's none of your business.

20
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,829
You're too used to being a babysitter.
Give it to me.

21
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,910
No way.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,350
Let me keep it for you.

23
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,990
I'll return it to you
when you've recovered.

24
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,430
-I'll not take up your time.
-No.

25
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,360
Don't forget to send me the script.

26
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,310
You're home.

27
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,190
Did you see our son?

28
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,150
I went there for meeting.

29
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,550
Why would I see him?

30
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,990
You've turned down so many seminars.

31
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,470
You knew that Jiang

32
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,510
was going to see his son.

33
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,110
That's why you tagged along.

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,030
Don't think that I know nothing.

35
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,000
He doesn't behave like my son.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,330
He's more like my enemy.

37
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,150
Both of you work in the same field.

38
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,710
Of course he's your enemy.

39
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,630
Judging from your expression,

40
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,290
you must have seen him, right?

41
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,390
What's wrong? Did you quarrel with him?

42
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,630
Look at you.

43
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,150
You know his pet peeve well

44
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,030
yet you choose to talk about it.

45
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,110
Was I wrong?

46
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,510
With his literary skills,

47
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,630
he could work on classics.

48
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,950
But look at him.

49
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,790
On the contrary, he's obsessed with

50
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,790
fantasy novels.

51
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,070
What messages

52
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,630
can be conveyed

53
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,550
through that kind of novels?

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,760
What contribution it has to the society?

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,690
How is it educational to children?

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,280
It's just writing.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,270
It's okay as long as the writer

58
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,150
and the reader are happy.

59
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,390
In the future...

60
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,560
Stop interfering.

61
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,230
Do you really think that
I love to interfere?

62
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,710
He has a long way to go.

63
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,600
Just let him explore the world.

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,230
Chu Li, are you reading the script?

65
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,990
Sis Xian Xian, are you back to work?

66
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,790
No, the doctor wants me to rest more.

67
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,720
I'm here to submit the draft.

68
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,920
After urging for half a month,

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,110
finally someone submits her draft.

70
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,070
Yes. Can we proceed with

71
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,070
the three stages of editing?

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,750
Yes.

73
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,470
Chu Li.

74
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,990
We can start with the editing process
of Book of Luo He God.

75
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,790
Print the draft on A4 papers.

76
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,510
I'll let you know

77
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,030
how does the first
and second stages of editing work

78
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,590
and whatnot.

79
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,030
Xiao Niao, upon receiving the draft,

80
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,520
you should proceed with
the three stages of editing right away.

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,110
The book written by Zhou Chuan

82
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,710
is the highlight
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

83
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,030
Therefore, the proof sheet
of 500,000 words

84
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,590
needs to be submitted
to the proof-room by next Friday.

85
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,670
Got it.

86
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,600
Chu Li.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,110
As far as I'm concerned,

88
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,630
the person in charge
of the three stages of editing

89
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,670
is usually
the managing editor of the book.

90
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,670
If you pass the assignment to them,

91
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,550
then from now on,

92
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,950
be it the launch, the promotion

93
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,870
or the sales,

94
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,600
the book will have nothing to do
with you anymore.

95
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,590
Chief Editor Yu,

96
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,190
I got for the agreement

97
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,360
by pestering Mr Zhou Chuan
on daily basis.

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,470
No doubt I'm a rookie

99
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,710
and I'm inexperienced,

100
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,150
but I can work on the first review

101
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,210
before passing the draft
to my superiors for approval.

102
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,230
Got it.

103
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,990
Chu Li.

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,680
No doubt you're the one

105
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
who entered into the agreement
with Zhou Chuan.

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,440
All of us know that

107
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,230
you're meritorious in this matter.

108
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,470
However,

109
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,110
after a careful thought,

110
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,800
I've arrived at the decision.

111
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,390
After all, you're a rookie.

112
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,200
You joined Yuan Yue not long ago.

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,550
It's very important to us.

114
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,470
We can't let you work on it alone.

115
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,110
Am I right?

116
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,830
Don't worry about
not getting any training.

117
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,430
Look.

118
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,030
Here is the draft of Hua Li
written by Mr Nian Nian.

119
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,510
I need help to proofread it.

120
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,080
You can start from this.

121
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,909
I heard that
it's an unspoken rule in the office.

122
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:00,550
The person who got the contract
will be the managing editor of the book.

123
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,990
I heard that

124
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,630
Zhou Chuan

125
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,760
entered into an agreement
with Yuan Yue Publishing House,

126
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,350
but not with you.

127
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,880
Am I right, Chief Editor Yu?

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,790
Leave it to Miao.

129
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,470
Chu Li, you're still young.

130
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,910
Like a toddler
who hasn't quite mastered walking,

131
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,350
how could you dream of running?

132
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,670
As for this book,

133
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,470
you can come to me anytime
if you have any question.

134
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,159
You requested to see me

135
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,159
because of Book of Luo He God, right?

136
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,240
I wish to fight for the opportunity.

137
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,030
I think Zhou Chuan...

138
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,790
Chu Li.

139
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
I've to remind you about two things.

140
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,960
Firstly,

141
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:57,070
Miao is your immediate superior.

142
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,430
If you have any query,

143
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,760
you should communicate with him, not me.

144
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,640
You're no longer a child.

145
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,200
You should know that

146
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,720
you shouldn't go over
your immediate superior's head,

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,430
right?

148
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,430
However, Miao...

149
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,360
Let's talk about the second thing.

150
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,440
It doesn't matter how Miao treat you,

151
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,080
or Xiao Niao.

152
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,990
Regardless the reason

153
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,830
he treats both of you differently,

154
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,290
none of them is important.

155
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,750
If he doesn't acknowledge
your work performance,

156
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,550
what you should do

157
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,480
is trying to gain his recognition.

158
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,630
Show him your capability.

159
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,320
Make them speechless.

160
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,230
Do you get it?

161
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,230

187
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,970
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

188
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,710
Hello?

189
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,200
Hello?

190
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,230
What happened?

191
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,760
Every day, I waited like a dog

192
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,550
in front of Zhou Chuan's house.

193
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,430
It took me so much of effort
to sign the contract with him.

194
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,630
Now, they assigned it to someone else.

195
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,560
They completely disregarded my effort.

196
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,830
Seriously?

197
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,910
It's me who got the contract.

198
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
Zhou Chuan didn't treat you like a dog.

199
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,040
You're not Zhou Chuan.

200
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,280
How do you know?

201
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,520
Since you're so mad with them,
why don't you resign?

202
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,120
If worse comes to worst,
just leave the office.

203
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,750
I'm mad at Miao,

204
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,480
not Yuan Yue Publishing House.

205
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,560
[I'm not going to]

206
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,200
[give up so easily.]

207
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,080
Furthermore, I promised Zhou Chuan that

208
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,960
I'll launch the book

209
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,040
[with good publicity.]

210
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,640
[I'll make sure the cover
is nicely drawn too.]

211
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,160
Will he think that

212
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm a liar?

213
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,590
Since when you have a pet dog?

214
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not a big deal.

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,230
[They've appointed
the managing editor of the book.]

216
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,960
Why didn't you fight back?

217
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,990
You've always been a fierce lady.

218
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,870
Why did you just keep quiet

219
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,600
instead of speaking up for yourself?

220
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,190
I fought back

221
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,760
but Miao is the Deputy Editor.

222
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,640
He's my immediate superior.

223
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,430
Without consulting Zhou Chuan,
Yuan Yue Publishing House

224
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,230
appointed the managing editor.

225
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,630
Do they still want to work with him
in the future?

226
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,120
It's pointless to let Zhou Chuan know.

227
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
He won't help me anyway.

228
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,080
There goes my Zhou Chuan.

229
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,160
I fought so hard to get Zhou Chuan.

230
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,390
Will they screw it up?

231
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,320
When has Zhou Chuan become yours?

232
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,480
[Why are you so sure that Zhou Chuan
won't take your side?]

233
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,080
Why did he sign the contract
if he's not on your side?

234
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,140
You're such a fool.

235
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,830
Something is not right.

236
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,960
Mr Fox, now I remember.

237
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,280
Things always manifest the opposite.

238
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,750
[There was a glimpse of hope.]

239
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,510
[After listening to you,]

240
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,440
it's become hopeless.

241

242
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,320
[You should eat something.]

[Hello, Chu Li, are you okay?]

244
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
There is nothing

246
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,880
Are you serious?

247
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,920
Did Chief Editor say that?

248
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes.

249
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,520
What should you do?

250
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,190
Why don't you tell Mr Zhou Chuan?

251
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,080
Why do all of you suggest the same thing?

252
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,760
Who else said that?

253
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,360
Another friend of mine said that.

254
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,160
No matter what,
I won't tell Zhou Chuan about it.

255
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,560
He's not related to me at all.

256
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,040
He doesn't have the obligation to help me.

257
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,440
Furthermore, in term of interest,

258
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
leaving Book of Luo He God

259
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,480
to an experienced editor like Miao

260
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,560
is better.

261
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,890
Zhou Chuan is not a fool.

262
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,470
However, between you and Miao,

263
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,110
Mr Zhou Chuan chose you.

264
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,680
Was it because of what I said to him?

265
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
I think my advice touched his heart.

266
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm just joking.

267
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,230
He didn't chose me.

268
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,230
He chose Yuan Yue Publishing House.

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
It does make sense.

270
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,880
Furthermore, I can't beg Zhou Chuan
to decide the managing editor

271
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
just because he is the author.

272
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,640
I can't expect all the authors

273
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,440
to take care of me, can I?

274
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,160
What are you going to do?

275
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,550
Are you going to give up?

276
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,960
Of course not.

277
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,760
So what if Miao
won't let me proofread the draft?

278
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,600
I won't give up.

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
I'll proofread the draft in secret.

280
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
Tomorrow morning, before work,

281

286
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,200

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
I pulled an all-nighter to read the draft

will take charge of the book?

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,520
Book of Luo He God

369
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,730
is considered as
unconventional literature.

370
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,050
It's new.

371
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,250
It's our priority.

372
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,680
Of course, it puts us
under great pressure.

373
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,320
I personally believe that

374
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
in order to make it the best seller,

375
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,250
we must take it seriously since
the beginning of the editing process.

376
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,640
We must leave it

377
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,100
to an experienced editor.

378
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,360
Look.

379
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,320
There are two editors

380
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,250
working under me.

381
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,520
One of them is Chu Li.

382
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,330
I think you know her.

383
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,360
She majored in Finance.

384
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
She's fairly new.

385
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,290
Another editor is Du Niao Niao.

386
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,080
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

387
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,650

in Editing and Publication.

[Book of Luo He God by Zhou Chuan

389
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,350
She's quite experienced.

390
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,760
If you ask me,

391
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
Niao Niao is the most suitable candidate

392
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,130
to carry out the first stage of editing.

393
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,040
I volunteered

394
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,100
to be the managing editor of the book.

395
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,770
However, after listening to my proposal,

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
Chu Li got upset.

397
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,520
Yes.

398
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,690
That's why

399
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,960
we would like to get your view
on this matter.

400
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,120
You've written a great book.

401
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,850
It's an important project.

402
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,520
We can't leave it to Chu Li

403
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,290
who is fairly new to the field.

404
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,080
What you said

405
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,360
does make sense.

406
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,160
Yes.

407
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,620
Is there any other reason?

408
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,290
Mr Zhou Chuan.

409
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,840
I've been your fan for a long time.

I've read Oriental Beauty

411

for more than three times.

412
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,920
Each reading reminds me that

413
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,800
you're certainly grown up
in a family of scholars.

414
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,680
You'll surely carry on
Mr Zhou Gu Xuan's legacy in the future.

415
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,490

from different publishing houses.

420

I was under the impression that

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,040
there is an unspoken rule in the field.

423
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,210
will be the managing editor.

424

to copy-editing,

to designing the cover,

and lastly, the launching and publication,

429

the managing editor.

Then, you simply took over the credit.

I don't think it's a good idea.

[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

551
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,970
[That's too much.]

552
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,900
Stinky Monkey! You're so ungrateful!

553
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,440
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

554
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,330
[The best way to
repay Mr Zhou Chuan's kindness]

555
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,930
[is making sure that
his book becomes a hit,]

556
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,210
[until the printing house
can't handle the order.]

557
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,270
Fine, you're not totally heartless.

558
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:03,610
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

559
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,210
[That's all?]

560
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
[Are you not going to buy him a meal?]

561
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,130
As for Mr Zhou Chuan's book,

562
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,490
we're going to break it into two parts.

563
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,750
It's better to limit it to 400,000 words.

564
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,410
Based on the schedule, Mr Zhou Chuan

565
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,490
will launch his book three months later.

566
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,930
From now on, you have to work overtime.

567
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,810
In two weeks,

568
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,470
you have to
complete the first stage of editing.

569
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,250
[Don't think that you can take it lightly]

570
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,090
[as Mr Zhou Chuan is on your side.]

571
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,290
Editors who fall out with the authors
in the process of editing

572
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,420
are great in number.

573
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,600
[Zhu Xi once said,]

574
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,330
["Nothing could be done
without a strong mind. "]

575
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,530
[Therefore, whenever I work on a book,]

576
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,450
[it would always
turn into a fierce battle.]

577
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,780
[Preparing the proof sheet
is the beginning of the battle.]

578
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,610
[I must persist to the end]

579
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,970
[and win the battle.]

580
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,690
We're here

581
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,170
to celebrate two newbies
of the editorial department

582
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,330
for passing their probationary period.

583
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,810
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

584
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,210
Xiao Niao, congratulations.

585
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,610
-Thank you, Mr Xia.
-Congratulations.

586
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,970
I hope both of you

587
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,330
take Yuan Yue as your home.

588
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,210
Of course.

589
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,810
I have to compliment Chu Li.

590
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,580
I heard that Director Gu of Xin Dun Books

591
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,100
was eager to publish Book of Luo He God.

592
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,610
It's never crossed my mind that Chu Li

593
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,270
would win Zhou Chuan's heart.

594
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,460
As the saying goes,
"A youth is to be regarded with respect".

595
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,490
No, that's my duty.

596
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,540
Xiao Niao is doing well too.

597
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,210
Mr He Ma agreed

598
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,670
to let us have five years
worth of copyright.

599
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,290
You must have worked really hard on that.

600
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,170
It's nothing.

601
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,170
I'm nothing compared to Chu Li.

602
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,130
Both of you are unique in your own way.

603
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,970
Yes.

604
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,770
They're unique in their own way.

605
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,730
If you ask me,

606
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,570
not only Xiao Niao is placid,

607
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,970
she is also smart and sensible.

608
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,170
She's systematic at work.

609
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,540
As for Chu Li...

610
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,770
Well...

611
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,500
She has a mind of her own.

612
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,130
It's quite good.

613
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,250
That's right.

614
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,340
Mr Zhou Chuan

615
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,660
is known for his bizarreness.

616
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,450
Only Chu Li can handle him.

617
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,370
Chu Li is the best candidate.

618
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,180
Therefore,

619
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,500
Chu Li can be considered as

620
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,430
special talent in Yuan Yue, right?

621
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,090
You're exaggerating.

622
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,220
It's too early to tell

623
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,330
if she's a talent.

624
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,300
Well, she's quite unusual.

625
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,370
Anyway, I still think that

626
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,030
Xiao Niao has more potential.

627
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,450
She's steady at work.

628
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,130
She's a good fit as an editor.

629
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,850
Miao, Chu Li works really hard.

630
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,770
All right.

631
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,330
What are you doing?

632
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,770
We hardly gather.

633
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,300
Come

634
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:49,890
Let's drink.

635
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,820
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

636
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,410
Congratulations.

637
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,220
Eat up.

638
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,620
Novel

639
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,970
is different from script.

640
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,460
The storyline

641
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,970
will be adjusted for sure.

642
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,590
I understand that.

643
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,370
Glad that you can understand that.

644
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,610
With regard to the setting of the zoo,

645
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,250
is it possible to adjust it?

646
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,010
However, the zoo is the core of the book.

647
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,610
You're right.

648
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,500
However,

649
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,170
Mr Jiang is talented.

650
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,090
Let alone the setting,

651
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,490
I believe that no matter

652
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,660
what kind of changes you need,

653
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,690
he can change it into something better.

654
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,540
Mr Jiang.

655
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,130
Is it possible to make
the male lead and the female lead

656
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,930
falling in love with each other?

657
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,170
In that case,

658
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,490
we can expand the age range
of our target audience.

659
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Director Li, I think you're right.

660
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,130
Not only will it help
neutralising the storyline,

661
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,900
it will also attract female audience
like me.

662
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,250
That's what I mean.

663
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,420
Mr Jiang.

664
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,750
Have you read Patio by Trevor Rosa before?

665
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:56,770
Yes.

666
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,650
I suggest that you refer to

667
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,850
the actions taken by
the main character in the book

668
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,770
especially his experience at the patio.

669
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,260
Not only is the plot very attractive,

670
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,090
it also plays a huge role

671
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,220
in promoting character development.

672
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,180
Director Li,

673
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,970
what does refer mean?

674
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,450
Just change it slightly.

675
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,850
After all, the plot

676
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,220
is quite compatible

677
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,570
with our film.

678
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,540
I don't think it's a good idea.

679
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,330
What's wrong?

680
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,060
I didn't ask you to copy the storyline.

681
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,940
If you do that,

682
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,820
we'll infringe the copyright.

683
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,610
Am I right?

684
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,690
I think...

685
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,430
Director Li, I'm sorry.

686
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,670
I think it's not the right time
to sell the copyright.

687
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,790
I look forward to working with you again.

688
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,820
What does that mean?

689
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,610
Director Li, please hold on.

690
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,810
How could he go back on his words?

691
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,210
Please wait for a second.

692
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,770
Mr Zhou Chuan.

693
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,100
What's wrong?

694
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,530
I'm here to return your umbrella.

695
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,770
My umbrella?

696
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,540
Why did I lend you the umbrella?

697
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,570
So,

698
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,170
on that day,
you placed the umbrella at the entrance

699
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,410
not because you intended to lend it to me.

700
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,730
It's because you thought
the umbrella was too heavy.

701
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,330
Or was it because you just wanted

702
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,810
to run in the rain once in a while?

703
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,410
Talk properly.

704
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,970
I'm sorry.

705
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,730
Now I remember. This umbrella

706
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,780
wasn't for you.

707
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,240
I wanted to lend it to Miao.

708
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,890
Miao?

709
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,060
Are you so close to him
that you would brave the rain

710
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,050
to leave the umbrella for him?

711
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,100
Am I so close to you
that I would brave the rain

712
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,760
to leave the umbrella for you?

713
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,620
Mr Zhou Chuan.

714
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,580
Please have some water.

715
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,969
Can I

716
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,050
talk to you

717
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,370
about the manuscript?

718
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,610
All right, you may speak now.

719
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,139
The main character in your book
fought with monsters in sequence.

720
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,730
In the beginning, it's stated that
the first monster was a strange bird,

721
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,929
the second monster was a tortoise,

722
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:41,449
the third monster was a white tiger,

723
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,570
and the fourth monster was a dragon.

724
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,620
However, later on, the third monster

725
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,380
became a nine-coloured deer.

726
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,639
Was it supposed to be a white tiger
or a nine-coloured deer?

727
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,020
Whichever part that has more descriptions

728
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,880
and would be difficult to amend
should be reserved.

729
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,780
There are more.

730
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,450
In the beginning, it's stated that the
main character's mum died from illness.

731
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,060
Why did his mum appear
out of nowhere in the end?

732
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,620
Just delete the line where it says

If it doesn't involve
major matters of principle,

you don't have to confirm with me

Hold on.

Mr Zhou Chuan,

738
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,730
it does involve the matter of principle.

739
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,330
Your novel is too long.

740
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,090
Could you please delete 100,000 words?

741
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,850
What?

742
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,360
You might as well don't publish the book.

743
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,860
No.

745
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,660
Why are you here?

00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,060
You didn't pick up my call.

747
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,330
Hence, I asked Xiao Bai

748
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,130
and Xiao Bai told me you're here.

749
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,860
Don't expect me to delete 100,000 words.

750
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,690
The print run that you offered

751
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,220
is humiliating.

752
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,970
Yet, you expect me
to cut down on the word counts?

Don't be mad.

I'm merely giving you a suggestion
as the editor.

756
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,220
You have the final say

757
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,280

Thank you for the compliment.

761
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,060
It's my duty.

762
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,850
Is it a little bit too much?

763
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,580
It's scary.

764
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,500
The whole chapter is cancelled
with a huge red cross.

765
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,190
The red ink penetrated through the paper.

766
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,670
You even poked holes
on some of the papers.

767
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,930
I've never seen

768
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,790
such emotional red cross before.

769
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,180
Was my writing so bad?

770
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,910
That's why you got so mad, is it?

771
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,460
No.

The same plot occurred twice.

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,010
I think one of them should be deleted.

Don't give any comment
if you have no idea how writing works.

775
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,730
I did that for a reason.

776
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,940
Besides the huge red cross,

777
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,650
you also drew a yawning cartoon.

778
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,530
What's wrong?

779
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
Was it because my writing is boring?

780
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,620
Now I remember.

781
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,450
I was exhausted
when I was reading this chapter.

782
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,770
I was too tired.

783
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,860
You fell asleep
while reading my writing?

784
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,340
No, I didn't fall asleep.

If we don't delete some of the contents,

786
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,730
the book will be too thick.

787
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,050
The price will increase
when a book is too thick.

788
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,100
It may affect

00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,160

there is an additional 100,000 words

there will be an additional 100 sheets.

Mr Jiang chose to retire

903
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,580
because he was exhausted
and he needed a break.

When his mind and body
are fully recharged,

905
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,420
he'll amaze the world
