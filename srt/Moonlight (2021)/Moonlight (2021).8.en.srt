I was doubtful.

38
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,030
Why would I lie to you?

Exactly,

40
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,350

there was an imitator in the forum

to yours.

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,390

for my artworks.

60
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,350

His style is really similar,

64

And now it has become...

187
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,190
After Chief Editor Yu's mother

188
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,510
picks Qiu Qiu up,

189
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,670
we'll be free.

190
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,070
I'll cook something good for you tomorrow.

191
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,300
Auntie, is this brother your boyfriend?

192
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,700
No way!

193
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,750
Why do you call me auntie,

194
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,630
but he's brother?

195
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,590
He's better-looking than you are.

196
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,910
You have such a great taste.

197
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,110
You can be a scout after you grow up.

198
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,790
What is a scout?

199
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,660
A scout is someone
who discovers people with good look.

200
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,510
For example, someone like me.

201
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,430
Then I've found someone,

202
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,350
she's my girlfriend.

203
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,750
You're so young,

204
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,870
do you even know what a girlfriend is?

205
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,190
I know.

206
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,980
In the games we play,

207
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,630
she's my wife.

208
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,550
We live together,

209
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,230
she even cooks for me.

210
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,830
Qiu Qiu, listen to me.

211
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,070
Living together and cooking for you

212
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,790
don't mean
that you're boyfriend and girlfriend.

213
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,510
Both of you might be
just landlord and tenant,

214
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,370
the kind of tenant
who has to follow the house rules.

215
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,500
Eat up.

216
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,350
Qiu Qiu.

217
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,550
Granny!

218
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,070
Yao Yao told me everything,

219
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,230
thank you so much for today.

220
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,070
Otherwise, we wouldn't know

221
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,830
what to do today.

222
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,790
It's fine, it's fine.

223
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,870
Where is Qiu Qiu's father?

224
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,310
He stays in another city.

225
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,030
It's been a year since he last came back.

226
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,590
I'm the one who takes care of him.

227
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,250
Otherwise
Yao Yao wouldn't be able to manage it.

228
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,990
I didn't know
Chief Editor Yu has been through so much.

229
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,910
Alright then,

230
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,790
you should go home now.

231
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,870
Sorry to have caused you trouble today.

232
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,510
Don't worry, it's fine.

233
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,990
Say goodbye.

234
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,710
Goodbye.

235
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,340
We're leaving.

236
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,350
Chief Editor Yu is really capable,

237
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,670
she works and takes care of her family.

238
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,140
Then she messes both of them up.

239
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,310
She always makes mistakes

240
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,370
and doesn't take good care of her son.

241
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,750
That's because men always
choose to work in another city.

242
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,470
Otherwise her burden can be lessened.

243
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,510
Don't attack us.

244
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,910
This has nothing to do with other men,

245
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,950
much less me.

246
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,510
This is the fifth time
Cocoon sent me a friend request.

247
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,630
Don't approve her!

248
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,520
I already approved her.

249
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,190
Mr Zhou Chuan,

250
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,070
I thought you don't like her.

251
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,230
You knew I don't like her,

252
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,960
but you made me meet up with her.

253
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,260
I don't know

254
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,350
what made you so mad,

255
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,270
I have not gotten even with you yet.

256
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,950
I had no choice.

257
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,830
She insisted to talk to you personally.

258
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,150
So I said yes.

259
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,080
It's you who caused this to happen.

260
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,270
Even after you approved her,

261
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,990
you can't chat with her.

262
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,990
Are you trying
to interfere in my private life?

263
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,840
Pay me your fine.

264
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,310
We're talking business here,

265
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,550
she just wants to skip over me
and cotton up to you.

266
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,670
This doesn't concern just both of you.

267
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,750
It also concerns our editors,

268
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,630
art editors and even the requests
from the printing house.

269
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,470
Tell her,

270
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,140
she has to discuss alongside
managing editor and art editor as well.

271
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,350
I was just joking. I didn't approve her.

272
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,710
But your mood is a bit unstable today.

273
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,430
People of this industry said
she's not easy to work with,

274
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,790
but you keep asking me to engage her,

275
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,790
saying that she's good and popular.

276
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,150
So what's going on now?

277
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,040
Have you regretted it?

278
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,870
It is her capability that I like.

279
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,910
As long as the illustrator can offer you
a great book cover,

280
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,950
I will hire her
even if she's a pain in the neck.

281
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,870
So, I will never regret it.

282
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,590
As for being mad at her,

283
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,510
I can't deny it.

284
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,070
That's because she spoke ill of my friend.

285
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,110
Your friend?

286
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,350
I'll be honest with you.

287
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,350
That Little Zhou Chuan

288
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,700
is actually a really good friend of mine.

289
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,230
But this is not the only thing
that made me mad.

290
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,220
I think anyone
who writes with all his heart

291
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,710
should not be made fun of.

292
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,110
He wrote for her artwork

293
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,350
with all his heart without any charges,

294
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,270
but she made fun of him behind his back.

295
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,790
That's really immoral.

296
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,120
That was an unreasonable justice.

297
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,860
But I'm telling the truth,

298
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,110
my friend is very talented.

299
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,700
He's like 3:7 with you.

300
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,270
You're seven, he's three.

301
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,310
3:7?

302
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,190
Are you sure?

303
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,590
Even if it's not 3:7,

304
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,390
there should be 2:8.

305
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,030
[It was 5:5, 6:4,]

306
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,070
[and now it's 8:2.]

307
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,910
[What a fence sitter.]

308
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,380
[You sure are ungrateful]

309
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,310
[with what Mr Fox has done for you.]

310
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,830
Medieval detective fiction,

311
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,750
that's rather interesting.

312
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,510
This book will be published
at the same time

313
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,580
as Jiang Yu Cheng’s new book.

314
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,870
But I believe, with your cover,

315
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,830
it will be a big hit.

316
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,550
Ms Gu,

317
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,510
don't worry.

318
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,470
I will do a great job

319
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,870
with this cover.

320
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,310
Now we're talking.

321
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,220
I heard,

322
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,750
you promised to work
with Yuan Yue Publishing House

323
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,510
before this, did you?

324
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,830
The word does get around very quickly.

325
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,950
You're right.

326
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,350
I'm working on a cover
for Book of Luo He God.

327
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,710
But don't worry about it.

328
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,670
Your project will not be affected.

329
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,830
Not only that,

330
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,340
I want priority.

331
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,710
You mean...

332
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,910
Go through the contract first.

333
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,080
[Two illustrations, 30,000 Yuan]

334
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,750
This price seems different

335
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,150
from what we discussed earlier on.

336
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,710
I fought for you.

337
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,700
I hope you'll come up with a work
equivalent to this price.

338
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,870
In that case,

339
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,130
we can work together in the future again.

340
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,230
Ms Gu, don't worry.

341
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,990
I will do my very best.

342
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,760
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

343
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,660
Not bad. Thanks a lot.

344
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,380
You're welcome. It's my job.

345
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,710
It's great that you're here, Chu Li.

346
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,590
When can I get

347
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,140
Cocoon's first draft?

348
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,950
I have confirmed
with Cocoon several times.

349
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,830
She will come up with a draft today.

350
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,590
After getting our confirmation,

351
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,720
she will give us a sketch this weekend.

352
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,270
The publicity
from Yuan Yue Publishing House

353
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,910
has started.

354
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,150
So, after you get the sketch,

355
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,630
email it to me immediately.

356
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,750
Understand?

357
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,830
By the way,

358
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,230
this is the circulation proposal

359
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,150
that was sent
by circulation department today.

360
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,230
Take a look at it.

361
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,480
Three hundred and fifty thousand copies?

362
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,550
What's the matter?

363
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,670
Can't you make it?

364
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,140
But they're asking for 350,000 copies
in one shot,

365
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,550
this is way too...

366
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,710
Who would've expected

367
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,190
that his reputation would rocket up,
right?

368
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,110
You're right,

369
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,750
but this amount is over the top.

370
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,700
This number

371
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,830
was proposed by Mr Liang

372
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,310
and approved by Mr Yang.

373
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,950
If anything goes wrong

374
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,110
on your side,

375
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,270
I think

376
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,670
you have to prepare yourself
for the worst.

377
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,790
Chu Li,

378
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,830
this book is the most important book

379
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,430
of Yuan Yue Publishing House this year.

380
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,350
Everyone has high hopes for it.

381
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,900
So, no matter
what difficulties you encounter,

382
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
you have to fix it.

383
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,750
What time is it now?

384
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,750
It's five before six.

385
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,070
Why hasn't Cocoon
submitted her first draft yet?

386
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,150
I have no idea.

387
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,870
I've sent her many messages,

388
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,750
but she didn't reply any of them.

lend me your phone.

[How is it going with the draft?]

395
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,230
[Mr Zhou Chuan has been saying]

396
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,089
[that he is looking forward to it
since yesterday.]

398
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,829
[I'm just as excited]

399
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,390

[The draft is ready.]

403
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,620
[I'll send it to you right now.]

404
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,590
Look.

405
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,830
I couldn't reach her the entire afternoon.

406
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,430
She responded
as soon as I mentioned Zhou Chuan.

407
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,300
In fact I'm quite excited.

408
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,310
I wonder what cover

409
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,240
Cocoon will draw for Mr Zhou Chuan.

410
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,550
[Something is wrong with my software.]

00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,190

00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,950
[Oh, God.]

413
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,830
[I spent the entire day for this draft.]

414
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,300
[What should I do?]

415
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,190
[Should I draw a new one for you?]

416
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,390
[I will send it to you
before you start working tomorrow.]

417
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,990
[Sure.]

Through several years of experience
as an art director,

419
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,070
the number of times my drawing soft-wares

420
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,510
was damaged beyond repair

421
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,950
was not more than five times.

422
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,070
Enough.

423
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
What can I do?

424
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,670
I can't diss her, can I?

425
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,870
I'm not a three-year-old.

426

A popular illustrator like Cocoon

427
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,180
usually has a lot of projects.

428
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,500
They'd choose buyers

429
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,630
who offer them higher price.

430
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,230

436
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,790
I hope it will bring you sweet dreams.

Jiang Yu Cheng?

438
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,830
She's my editor,

439
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,430
why do you care about her sleep quality?

440
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,540
You have never given me any gift before.

441
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,350
She is also my editor.

442
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,350
Have I not given you any gift?

443
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,590
Who gave you that Tyrannosaurus

444
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,110

445
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,670
Everything has an order.

446
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,910
Are you sure you gave me
that Tyrannosaurus?

447
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,110
I took it myself.

448
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,270
You took my stuff,
how dare you be so proud about it!

449
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,550
She's been my reader for seven years,

450
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,750
speaking of order.

451
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,230
So what if she's been your reader
for seven years?

452
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,550
She's still my editor.

453
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,870
Mr Jiang,

454
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,790
it's you.

455
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,100
I haven't come out for so long,

456
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,950
and I met you as soon as I left the house.

457
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,230
I'm so lucky.

458
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,550
Which editor you guys were talking about?

459
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,750
He bought essential oil for sleeping
for my editor.

460
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,150
She's our editor.

461
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,650
That essential oil you bought
the other day?

462
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,070
Have you been meeting very often recently?

463
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,110
-No.
-No.

464
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Mr Jiang,

465
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,190
your new book is just amazing.

466
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,350
After reading the first few chapters,

467
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,350
I couldn't help but kept reading it.

468
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,870
Let's do a toast.

469
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,220
How dare you drink?

470
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,950
Are you still writing tonight?

471
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,830
Here, brother.

472
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,630
I'll drink with you.

473
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,160
Are you publishing a new book?

474
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,190
Yes.

475
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,190
My book will be published
at the same time as yours.

476
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,510
There's nothing wrong
with publishing at the same time.

477
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,470
But if they share the same concept,
that'd be terrible.

478
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,750
Am I right, Ms Gu?

479
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,810
I have faith in Yun Fei.

480
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,060
Brother,

481
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,700
you and I should drink today.

482
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,950
Come.

483
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,150
I wish our new books are selling well,

484
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,410
and the winners will be determined soon.

485
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,390
Good, Mr Jiang.

486
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,270
Just because of what you said,

487
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,580
I'll finish this.

488
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,070
But after drinking this,

489
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,470
we'll be rivals.

490
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,510
Brother,

491
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,390
nothing is absolute.

492
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,990
You still have a long way to go.

493
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,710
Come, here a toast for you.

494
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,430
You don't want to explain

495
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,230
or you don't know how to explain?

496
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,340
Don't forget that you're the only person

497
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,750
who knows the setting of my new book.

498
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,070
Now, your writer, Yun Fei
is also writing the same thing.

499
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,510
Don't you think...

500
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,430
Yeah.

501
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,830
There's no way for you to explain it.

502
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,550
Is that what you think of you?

503
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,230
Forget it.

504
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,630
No. Let's make it clear.

505
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,350
Jiang Yu Cheng.

506
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,350
Do you not trust me?

507
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,550
Do you think this is ridiculous?

508
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,910
Of course it is.

509
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,870
[Because I am a joke to you.

510
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,080
I bet the past two years
must've been hard for you.

511
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,350
It must be tough for you to face a writer

512
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,310
who's past his prime, am I right?

513
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,870
I think everything I've done for you

514
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,200
in the past two years
was for your own good.

515
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,810
But have you ever listened to what I said?

516
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,270
For my own good?

517
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,310
Would you betray me
if it was for my own good?

518
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,150
Betray?

519
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,670
I betrayed you?

520
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,310
So everything that I've done

521
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,510
is a betrayal?

522
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,840
I do not need
your self-righteous effort.

523
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,790
You're not a joke, I'm a joke.

524
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,470
Gu Bai Zhi,

525
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,590
do you still love me?

526
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,790
We're done.

527
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,040
Now you can't dance any more, can you?

528
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,430
Young people still can continue dancing,

529
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,710
if your book doesn't sell
as good as theirs in the future,

530
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,390
what should you do?

531
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,870
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

532
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,310
Were you guys drinking?

533
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,190
Why did he drink so much?

534
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,430
Poor Mr Jiang.

535
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,670
Is he stressed out recently?

536
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,550
I was a little negligent of him recently.

537
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,470
Come.

538
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,390
There'll be another house rule
for the tenant.

539
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,180
It's forbidden to go on and on
about that old man, Jiang

540
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,150
in front of the landlord.

541
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,470
Why?

542
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,230
What did Mr Jiang do to you?

543
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,390
Can't you see how tired I am?

544
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,550
All you care is Jiang Yu Cheng,

545
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,280
Jiang Yu Cheng, Jiang Yu Cheng,

546
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,990
That's because you seem energetic

547
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,630
and are in fine fettle.

548
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,460
Mr Zhou Chuan, you have great tolerance

549
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,100
to alcohol and other people.

550
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,710
I don't even get any hint of alcohol.

551
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,150
I've stopped drinking

552
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,430
to develop a concept for my new book.

553
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,630
New book?

554
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,670
It is forbidden to discuss work
in the private time of the landlord.

555
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,710
It is forbidden to inquire
about the privacy of the landlord.

556
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,640
It is forbidden
to make the landlord reveal his plan.

557
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,230
Do you want to know?

558
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,750
So you've broken those three rules.

559
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,950
That's 300 yuan.

560
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,790
Why are you still awake at this hour?

561
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,630
I remember it now.

562
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,990
Did you go into my room

563
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,430
and open my gift?

564
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,540
Me?

565
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,740
Do I have to sneak into your room?

566
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,060
Am I a pervert?

567
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,470
Then why is the gift

568
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,460
Mr Jiang gave me open?

569
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,900
How do I know?

570
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,310
I saw it when Er Gou was biting it.

571
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,150
Listen, you should thank me instead.

572
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,500
Otherwise,
would the essential oil remain intact?

573
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,510
Nonsense.

574
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,990
How was Er Gou able to open my door?

575
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,390
Go ahead and ask him.

576
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,660
I didn't go in.

577
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,300
Really?

578
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,310
If you dare to doubt the landlord again,

579
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,950
you'll be fined 500 yuan.

580
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,390
Fine.

581
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,870
I'll let you off this time.

582
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,590
You're letting me off?

583
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,120
But I'm not letting you off.

584
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,820
Let me ask you,

585
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,830
are you enjoying the privilege

586
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,630
with my name?

587
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,150
Since I hold the aces,

588
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,270
I definitely have to make good use of it.

589
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,190
Although I didn't manage
to make her submit her work,

590
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,830
I still have to work hard.

591
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,310
Meanwhile, Mr Zhou Chuan,
please lend me your name.

592
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,350
You didn't study finance
in the university, did you?

593
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,110
You must've studied
Face-changing of Sichuan Opera.

594
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,750
Please don't say that.

595
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,630
By the way,

596
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,150
there's millet porridge in the pot.

597
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,310
You can drink it when you're hungry.

598
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,270
I'll go upstairs now.

599
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,710
Tell me if you're coming up
with a new book,

600
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,790
don't stay up late.

601
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,190
Come back.

602
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,380
What's the matter?

603
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,870
Be careful tomorrow morning.

604
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,550
Don't let Jiang see you.

605
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,470
I hate explaining to him.

606
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,030
Don't worry about it.

607
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,820
-This...
-Hush.

608
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,100
Mr Jiang saw me.

609
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,870
It's fine.

610
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,150
He has a memory of a fish when he's drunk.

611
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,790
What a relief.

612
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:06,790
By the way,

613
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,510
keep it down when you're in your room.

614
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,750
He's drunk,

615
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,030
he'll sleep until 10 a.m.
at the very least.

616
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,910
You won't meet him before work tomorrow.

617
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,060
Got it.

618
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,910
Rest early.

619
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,510
I'm going to sleep in my room now.

620
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,860
Good night, Mr Zhou Chuan.

621
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,590
Good night.

622
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,680
It's not even 10 o'clock yet,
why did you wake up already?

623
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,230
Did you hear any noise?

624
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,710
Noise?

625
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,030
It's Er Gou.

626
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,830
It was so loud.

627
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,910
Look at you.

628
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,790
You're not young any more,

629
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,790
yet you drank until you vomited,

630
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,230
aren't you embarrassed?

631
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,470
Speaking of which, it was weird.

632
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,750
Usually when I'm drunk,

633
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,350
I'd sleep until the next day.

634
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,990
However, I dreamt of Chu Li last night.

635
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,310
What now?

636
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,070
You can't drink more than Yun Fei,

637
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,630
so you feel threatened now, don't you?

638
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,890
You won't even stop exploiting your editor
in your dreams.

639
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,550
Maybe I just really enjoy the fact

640
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,750
that she's my editor.

641
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,070
Dreams at night

642
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,070
reflect daytime thoughts, I guess.

643
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,740
You think too much.

644
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,900
It's hot. It's so hot.

645
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,870
Cocoon is really a popular illustrator.

646
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,430
Under the boundless sky,

647
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,030
even the edge of the young man's clothes

648
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,990
was so vivid.

649
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,230
The vibe,

650
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,110
the lines,

651
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,510
and the story it portrays,

652
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,910
the end product will not be disappointing.

653
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,830
Here's the thing.

654
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,500
As I see it,

655
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,750
there's no technical issue
with this illustration.

656
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,100
However, this is not a draft,

657
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,950
it's a semi-finished work.

658
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,510
Send it.

659
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,480
Isn't it a good thing
that it's almost completed?

660
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,660
It's a good thing,

661
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,270
but what if we want to edit it?

662
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,030
Besides, we asked for two characters,

663
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,460
she only drew one character.

664
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,830
Cocoon doesn't reply my message again.

665
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,630
Ah Xiang,

666
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,390
what if... I'm saying, what if

667
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,590
something goes wrong with Cocoon's work,

668
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,950
do we have time to engage another artist?

669
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,520
I don't think we'll make it on time.

670
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,990
Take a look at Moonlight's Weibo account.

671
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,350
Someone published Cocoon's draft

672
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,470
as a sneak preview of Book of Luo He God.

673
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,270
The readers are anticipating it now.

674
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,950
Who did this?

675
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,110
Who did you cc it to?

676
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,350
Miao, Chief Editor Yu, Mr Xia?

677
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,190
No matter which one of them did it,

678
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,990
they're all my superiors.

679
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,310
Hello, Mr Jiang.

680
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,350
By the way, Mr Jiang,

681
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,630
why did you bring the meeting forward?

682
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,110
I was supposed

683
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,990
to attend Writers Association conference
tomorrow,

684
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,110
but Zhou Chuan suddenly told me
he's going as well.

685
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,830
So we have to take the same train.

686
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,070
Really?

687
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,230
He finally came around.

688
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,310
That's amazing.

689
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,890
Do you know Writers Association too?

690
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,910
I know a little bit.

691
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,470
I also want him to go.

692
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,990
The world of literature is vast after all,

693
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,430
what we learn is just a drop in the ocean.

694
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,150
I agree.

695
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,190
Speaking of which,
I've read the second draft.

696
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,300
Here's my opinion.

697
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,550
Those parts marked with red

698
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,350
are the parts I wish you'd remove.

699
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,470
However, there are quite a lot to remove,

700
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,990
but it was really...

701
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,680
I have to remove the whole chapter?

702
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,710
Er Gou, I'm going on a business trip
for a few days.

703
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,190
Stay home and listen to your sister,

704
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,510
do you understand?

705
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,350
Mr Zhou Chuan,

706
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,670
take care and enjoy the lecture.

707
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,200
Do you know where I'm going?

708
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,750
I just finished my meeting with Mr Jiang,

709
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,670
he told me.

710
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,150
Jiang Yu...

711
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,450
Concentrate on your meeting,

712
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,930
don't make small talk.

713
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,870
That wasn't a small talk,

714
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,150
we just happened to talk about you.

715
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,390
Happened to talk about me?

716
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,110
I was an accident?

717
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,580
If there's anything that you want to know,

718
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,310
could you just ask me in the future?

719
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,990
Don't ask him,

720
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,230
understand?

721
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,790
Buy canned dog food if it's not enough.

722
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,430
Claim the money from me later.

723
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,390
Take Er Gou to change dressing
and remove stitches on Friday.

724
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,750
By the way, when I'm not here,

725
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,150
those 30 house rules are still effective.

726
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,870
Do you want to talk back to me?

727
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,830
Why would I?

728
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,230
How's the cover from Cocoon?

729
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,150
I told you not to engage Cocoon.

730
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,390
Now you regret it.

731
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,790
Did you slide down your sunglasses

732
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,500
just to tell me this?

733
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
How else can I see
your regretful expression clearly?

734

00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,590
Don't pressurize me with the contract.

920
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,670
I want to speak
to Mr Zhou Chuan personally.

921
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,430
Mr Zhou Chuan is away.

922
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,750
He switched off his phone,

923
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,540
even I can't reach him.

924
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,180
I knew it.

925
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,350
It was you.

926
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,310
It was you

927
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,840
who stopped Mr Zhou Chuan
from contacting me.

928
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,870
What do you want?

929
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,070
I won't revise my work.

930
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,990
I will complain to Mr Zhou Chuan.

931
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,140
I respect you because you're
the creator of this illustration,

932
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,630
this is why I've talked with you
for several times.

933
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,590
But what about you?

934
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,670
You're still going your own way.

935
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,270
I'll give you a heads-up.

936
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,350
If you don't fix it

937
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,190
according to my request,

938
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,190
I'll ask someone else to fix it,

939
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,270
or

940
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,450
we might as well reject your work.

941
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Reject my work?

942
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,750
You're a newbie,

943
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,350
how dare you push me about.

944
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,270
According to the contract,
I totally have the right to do it.

945
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,670
If we reject your work,

946
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,180
please return us the deposit

947
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,300
and compensate us.

948
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,830
We'll do whatever we have to do.

949
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,990
You...

950
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,430
Mum, I'm going out.

951
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,590
Will you come home for dinner?

952
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,750
I don't think so.

953
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,470
Where are you going?

954
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,430
Come back here!

955
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,910
Sit down.

956
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,460
Tonight,

957
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,510
I'm buying dinner

958
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,230
for my old friends
from publishing industry.

959
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,710
Come with me.

960
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,630
Sit down!

961
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,790
I'm not going.

962
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,830
They heard that you've come back,

963
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,910
so they personally asked for you.

964
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,870
They're showing you respect.

965
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,990
Who do you think you are?

966
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,550
Me?

967
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,110
I'm just a lowly scribbler.

968
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,660
Zhou Chuan!

969
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,990
It was you who said this.

970
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,180
What's going on with you two?

971
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,510
Why are you arguing?

972
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,110
You're making me headache.

973
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,630
Would it kill you

974
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,360
to stop fighting for a few days?

975
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,350
A scholarly family, huh?

976
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,830
Both of you are like dictators.

977
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,990
If the words get out,

978
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,520
you'll be a laughing stock.

979
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,590
Do you really think I don't know

980
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,550
the reason you refuse to go?

981
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,110
It's because those seniors

982
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,660
from the publishing house

983
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,590
refused to publish

984
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,470
your stupid debut work back in the days.

985
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,380
The stuff you wrote are trash!

986
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,190
You're wasting papers!

987
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,990
You don't have that skill.

988
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,190
Who is there to blame?

989
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,100
Zhou Gu Xuan!

990
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,150
You... Prick!

991
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,350
How dare you call your father

992
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,110
by his name?

993
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,680
You must've had bad influence
during high-school.

994
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,220
You're a terrible son.

995
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,280
Failing to educate the child
is the fault of the father.

996
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,430
Did I not educate you?

997
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,140
Was bringing you to this world

998
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,580
my fault?

999
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,070
I think

1000
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,550
you might be right.

1001
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,470
You...

1002
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,550
Where are you going?

1003
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,080
I'm running away from home.

1004
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,960
What's wrong with the pipe?

1005
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,190
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1006
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,310
Hello? Hello?
Is this the management office?

1007
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,180
The pipe in 2070 is broken!

1008
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,910
Can you send someone to fix it
as soon as possible?

1009
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,870
[Hi, there.]

1010
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,750
[We'll file an urgent report.]

1011
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,750
[But the plumber]

1012
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,790
[can only come tomorrow morning.]

1013
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,470
What? Tomorrow?

1014
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,430
Do you not understand

1015
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,990
the meaning of urgency?

1016
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,350
If you come tomorrow, my house...

1017
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,510
My... My house will be flooded.

1018
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,270
Send someone to fix it now!

1019
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,310
Turn off the valve if the pipe is broken.

1020
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,710
Why did you cover it with your hand?

1021
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,240
If the metal tube is broken,

1022
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,670
you will hurt your hand!

1023
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,430
Mr... Mr Zhou Chuan.
