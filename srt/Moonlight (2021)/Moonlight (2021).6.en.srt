00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,870
How long did it take from the time
he agreed to write the manuscript

10
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,910
He took so little time to write

11
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,440

You just follow the directions

29
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,990

Mr Zhou Chuan is your idol,

to be foreign?

Jiang Yu Cheng posted on
his Weibo account

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,310
about the prologue

46
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,870
of his new book,
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

48
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,430

and there are more than
8,000 comments alone.

51
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,110
What is more interesting
about this matter is

52
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,550
when I saw his prologue

53
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,670
I thought it looked very familiar.

54
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,990
Because the structure of the story

55
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,150
is exactly the same as the article

56
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,590
of the first volume

57
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,310
published in Moonlight Magazine.

58
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,180
No.

59
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,910
I should say it is almost identical

60
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,029
because it's more detailed.

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,790
You're saying he used
our First Volume Project

62
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,750
to give his new book

63
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,380
a big advertisement?

64
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,830
Exactly.

65
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,340
That's why I wanted to ask Chu Li,

66
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,350
Did you deliberately

67
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,310
let your idol, Jiang Yu Cheng

68
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,350
publish a free advertisement

69
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,820
in Moonlight?

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,630
If that's the case,

71
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,020
do you get any benefits?

72
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,550
No.

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,310
I don't know

74
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,390
why Mr Jiang would do that.

75
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,909
You don't know?

76
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,230

The priority now

79
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,659
is how to get this new book, otherwise

80
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,350

82
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,940

You?

84
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,030
Do you know how many companies out there

85
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,470
are now asking privately
about this book?

86
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,110

I'm sure

89
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,440

sink into obscurity like this,

189
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,560
that will be the biggest insult
to my readers.

190
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,790
If Uncle Jiang had known that his son

191
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,870
had such a touching outlook on life,

192
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,670
he would have been very pleased.

193
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,710
No.

194
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,230
You asked me to help the
little editor write the preamble,

195
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,110
and I said yes.

196
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,990
Now, you're trying to persuade me

197
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,320
to sign on with
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

198
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,270
You try so hard to help her,

199
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,820
is there an ulterior motive for her?

200
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,710
I'm just

201
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,470
trying to save your conscience.

202
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,350
Hello.

203
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,270
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

204
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,820
You're with Mr Jiang now, right?

205
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,150
You call me to look for him?

206
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,550
[Mr Jiang posted]

207
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,310
[your half-naked bathing back
picture on Weibo.]

208
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,370
[He doesn't have his phone with him?]

209
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,350
He...

210
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,670
He has no work ethic.

211
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,400
He never looks at his phone
when he's on vacation.

212
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,830
Right,

213
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,030
Today, Jiang Yu Cheng's Weibo
is very lively.

214
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,590
You...

215
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,060
I... I'm fine.

216
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,670
Enjoy your vacation.

217
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,950
[Will this Monkey
come over here right away?}

218
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,270
What's wrong?

219
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,590
You should check your phone to see

220
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,120
if there is her missed call,
message or email.

221
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,630
Who?

222
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,590
Monkey.

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,910
Hurry.

224
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,470
Except for a phone call a few hours ago,

225
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,630
there's nothing else.

226
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,910
That's not normal.

227
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,190
You don't know how difficult
she is to deal with.

228
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,350
She could have stayed up all night

229
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,310
at my door with a bun.

230
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,610
The situation is very urgent now.

231
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,470
Could she be so calm?

232
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,990
Anyway, you are the one
who can't stay calm now.

233
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,030
Sister,

234
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,630
just tell me the room number.

235
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,590
If you don't believe me,
you can follow me

236
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,450
to see if he will open the door
when he hears my voice.

237
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,780
Yesterday,
after I quarrelled with my husband,

238
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,590
he was hiding here alone.

239
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,470
I called him

240
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,300
and a stranger answered the phone.

241
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,990
I'm really scared now.

242
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,260
What if he abandons me?

243
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,390
[She really came over.]

244
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,990
-Sister, we're all women.
-This...

245
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,190
Please help me.

246
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,540
We really can't do that.

247
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,460
He's the one I'm looking for.

248
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,580
Why are you here?

249
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,990
Miss,

250
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,710
since you've found your husband...

251
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,030
I'm not her husband.

252
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,310
Let go.

253
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,550
I'll call the police
if you don't let go.

254
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,390
Honey, don't you want me anymore?

255
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,870
No...

256
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,790
Husband?

257
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,990
Hi, Mr Zhou Chuan.

258
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,030
How did you get here?

259
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,890
Striving so hard to see your idol?

260
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,780
I must meet with Mr Jiang,

261
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,630
and I must be

262
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,630
the first editor who meets with him.

263
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,110
Jiang Yu Cheng is sleeping now.

264
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,870
If you wake him up at this hour,

265
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm not sure whether
you'll get out alive.

266
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,590
You think everyone is

267
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,670
as amiable as I am?

268
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,430
You?

269
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,900
Amiable?

270
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,110
How do you know I am here?

271
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,590
Mr Jiang tagged the location
in his post at Weibo.

272
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,230
Mr Zhou Chuan,

273
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,670
do you think Mr Jiang

274
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,950
will let our company to publish
The Disappearing Amusement Park?

275
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,510
I know this book means a lot to him.

276
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,900
After he posted the prologue yesterday,

277
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,990
there must be many publishing companies

278
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,750
want to approach him.

279
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,620
Am I the first one to come to you?

280
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,590
I don't know.

281
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,110
I think so.

282
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,710
But I'm curious.

283
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,350
A normal girl at this time

284
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,350
should first cry and say,

285
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,430
"How could Mr Jiang be like this?",

286
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,750
"How dare he lie to me!"

287
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,550
How come you don't have
this kind of emotion?

288
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,510
I wish to ask this way too.

289
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,510
After thinking about it,

290
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,440
the author is the knife
in the hands of the editor.

291
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,950
As a general,

292
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,580
if I can't make good use
of my own weapon,

293
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,950
but use the Heaven Reliant Sword
to cut watermelon,

294
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,590
the watermelon will be shattered,

295
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,390
the table will be split in half,

296
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,230
then, I will be blaming
the weapon for being too sharp.

297
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,630
No way.

298
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,270
I can't blame him.

299
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,830
I can only convince him.

300
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,990
In your heart,

301
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,830
What level of weapon am I?

302
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,190
You can be considered as
Dragon Slaying Sabre.

303
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,390
Alright.

304
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,910
I'll help you call Mr Jiang

305
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,030
out now.

306
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,510
You...

307
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,750
Why are you here?

308
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,460
Hi, Chu Li.

309
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,690
I'm Jiang Yu Cheng.

310
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,630
Aren't you a book store owner?

311
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,360
How could you be Jiang Yu Cheng.

312
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,230
I never told you my identity before.

313
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,590
Will you blame me?

314
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,750
Of course no.

315
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,700
If I had known you were Mr Jiang,

316
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,900
I would have visited
the book store every day.

317
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Nice to meet you.

318
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,030
Let's sit down and talk.

319
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,070
This makes it look like

320
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,590
a meeting of siblings.

321
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,920
Come, sit down and chat.

322
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,430
Thank you, Chu Li...

323
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,760
Thank you for pulling out
the chair for me.

324
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,310
Thank you, Chu Li.

325
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,140
It must have been hard

326
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,750
to come all this way to find me.

327
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,390
No, it's not hard.

328
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,270
I think it's worth it

329
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,070
to meet you.

330
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,630
Chu Li,

331
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,350
didn't you say you have
some serious matter

332
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,830
to talk to Jiang Yu Cheng?

333
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,310
Yes.

334
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,430
Mr Jiang, I'm here to talk to you about

335
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,790
the serialisation of
The Disappearing Amusement Park

336
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,910
in Moonlight Magazine.

337
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,670
You sent us the prologue earlier.

338
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,750
Can you...

339
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,550
Actually, I just think

340
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,870
that story

341
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,870
conforms with your project.

342
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,030
But then I realized that

343
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,590
it caused you a lot of trouble.

344
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,950
I'm sorry.

345
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,390
It's okay.

346
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,190
I have been your reader for many years.

347
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,550
I have also been
waiting for your new book.

348
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,070
If you can give
Moonlight Magazine a chance,

349
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,430
I will do everything I can

350
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,910
to meet your conditions.

351
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,550
Everything is negotiable.

352
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,310
Is everything

353
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,670
really negotiable?

354
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,840
I'll try my best.

355
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,550
On the contract,

356
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,070
my guaranteed minimum royalty

357
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,780
must be twice as much as
his Book of Luo He God.

358
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,070
Why?

359
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,860
Don't you dare say yes!

360
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,590
I'm afraid this may be
a little difficult.

361
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,270
If so,

362
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,470
I really can't find any reason

363
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,270
to cooperate with
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

364
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,510
I've met

365
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,630
your Deputy Editor Miao before.

366
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,630
He personally does not agree

367
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,790
with my creative style.

368
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,590
That's Deputy Editor Miao.

369
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,550
The person who came
to see you this time is me.

370
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,110
He doesn't know you well.

371
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,710
Chu Li,

372
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,310
if

373
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,910
I let you publish
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

374
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,670
will you treat it well?

375
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,150
Of course I will.

376
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,390
I'll be sure to proofread it myself,

377
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,510
word by word,

378
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,980
go over the mountains to find

379
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,270
the best illustrator for you,

380
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,589
fight with my superior for 800 rounds

381
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,750
to get the best pay for you.

382
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,430
Mr Jiang,

383
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,030
I'll try to fulfil all your requests.

384
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,550
Does a newcomer's verbal promise count?

385
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,830
Chu Li,

386
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,310
this time we're on
the same target again.

387
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,690
I won't cooperate with Xin Dun Books.

388
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,690
You don't want to cooperate
with Xin Dun Books or me?

389
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,150
Why do I feel

390
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,950
the atmosphere between
the two of them is strange?

391
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,110
Children shall not get involved
in adults' business.

392
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,460
As a Content Planning Director

393
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,070
of Xin Dun Books,

394
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,190
I'd like to negotiate
a business contract with you.

395
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,180
To sign or not,

396
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,580
please have a look
at the conditions first.

397
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,580
This is a full copyright contract.

398
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,910
I've already signed it.

399
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,230
Serialise on our website first,

400
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,350
your new book will be published later.

401
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,710
A maximum of 15% of royalty
is offered to you.

402
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,350
Then, the profits from film and gaming
development will be shared with 50-50.

403
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,150
A conservative estimate is that

404
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,280
the first period should have
a seven-figure return.

405
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,270
Hundred thousand?

406
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,870
You can tell me anything else you want.

407
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,100
I can make the call.

408
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,430
This little girl

409
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,270
should have to ask
her superior for permission

410
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,550
even when she wants to
buy a cup of coffee downstairs.

411
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,610
It's just waste of time to talk to her.

412
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,590
I heard that

413
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,980
Xin Dun Books has signed

414
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,470
a new author of suspense.

415
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,820
If you agree to sign on with us,

416
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,030
I can guarantee that

417
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,530
all resources will give priority to you.

418
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,110
It's true that people who have no use

419
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,630
can just be discarded.

420
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,230
Jiang Yu Cheng,

421
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,910
You and I are the same kind of person.

422
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,800
You're not leaving yet?

423
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,660
You want to hear the whole thing?

424
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,430
First come, first served.

425
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,670
I'm not done yet.

426
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,990
Mr Jiang,

427
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,150
even though Yuan Yue Publishing House

428
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,150
can't offer you the best deal

429
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,710
and I'm just a newbie,

430
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,750
as you heard just now,

431
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,990
a signed contract

432
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,830
may not be fulfilled

433
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,190
when they sign a new author later.

434
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,270
Yuan Yue Publishing House
won't be like this.

435
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,530
She's sharp-tongued.

436
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,670
Yuan Yue Publishing House
is a bit old though,

437
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,220
it is a carefully cultivated nursery.

438
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,990
Xin Dun Books is like
a fast harvesting shed.

439
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,190
Those who have no use will be discarded.

440
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,990
How do you know

441
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,190
you will not be abandoned in the future?

442
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,910
When the entire market
is full of productions of shed,

443
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,710
nursery will become wasteland.

444
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,390
Yuan Yue Publishing House
goes against the trend,

445
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,050
showing commendable spirit.

446
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,390
Mr Jiang,

447
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,020
no matter what choice you make,

448
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,550
I'll still respect you.

449
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,980
You're done, right? Let's go.

450
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,180
Mr Jiang,

451
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,230
no matter what choice you make,

452
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,160
I'll be your loyal reader forever.

453
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,710
Please choose us, Mr Jiang.

454
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,870
Mr Zhou Chuan,

455
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,750
are you in a bad mood?

456
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,750
I enjoyed the food,
drinks and hot spring.

457
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,270
I'm in a good mood.

458
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,750
You are

459
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,430
having fun talking
with your idol, right?

460
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,870
Not bad.

461
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,670
I'll get going now?

462
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,800
Where are you going?

463
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,190
Station.

464
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,910
I can't afford to stay in
such an expensive hotel.

465
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,940
Mr Zhou Chuan, enjoy your vacation.

466
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,950
I will try not to disturb you.

467
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,430
Oh right.

468
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,310
Could you pass this

469
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,710
to Mr Jiang for me?

470
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,510
You even prepared a gift to him?

471
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,030
Where's mine?

472
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,830
This is not gift.

473
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,750
To be precise,

474
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,310
this is Mr Jiang's belonging.

475
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,030
I took it from Mr Xia.

476
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,790
Goodbye.

477
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,790
Wait a minute.

478
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,230
Hello, one room on my account.

479
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,990
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,030
We've just been booked out

481
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,350
of our last room.

482
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,880
Then why don't you stay in my room?

483
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,630
No!

484
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,950
I'll take the train and leave by myself.

485
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,550
What are you thinking about?

486
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,750
I will share a room with Jiang Yu Cheng.

487
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,280
You can just stay in my room.

488
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,990
That's not good.

489
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,430
Cut the crap.

490
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,950
I do not want my editor
to die of overwork.

491
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,880
You get a day off at public expense.

492
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,510
Alright then. Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

493
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,030
Who is that?

494
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,910
Hi, room service.

495
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,870
This is your hot spring bathing suit.

496
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,590
Your boyfriend bought it himself

497
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,060
and called us
to have it delivered to you.

498
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,990
Mr Zhou Chuan?

499
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,580
No.

500
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,460
He isn't my boyfriend.

501
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,430
The hot spring is just downstairs.

502
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,090
Have a good rest and a good day.

503
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,030
Thank you.

504
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,540
It's so comfortable.

I have liked for seven years.]

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,550
[I could not help but imagine]

510
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,030
[we're destined to meet
with rolling thunder in the sky]

511
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,630

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,940
Mr Zhou Chuan,

525
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,470
why are you here?

526
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,870
No.

527
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,540
Is the hot spring owned by your family?

528
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,910
Why can't I come?

529
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,310
You're holding your phone just now.

530
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,070
Who are you messaging?

531
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,390
Boyfriend?

532
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,070
Mr Zhou Chuan,

533
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,940
this seems to be a
private matter, right?

534
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,390
You're so happy to see
Jiang Yu Cheng today.

535
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,910
You didn't work so hard
for signing me back then.

536
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,370
It is close to sacrificing your life,
right?

537
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,510
Are you worried that

538
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,070
if I really sign Mr Jiang,

539
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,550
I'll favour him?

540
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,470
Don't worry.

541
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,060
You two

542
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,630
are my little babies to me.

543
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,790
What are you doing?

544
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,190
Staring at you for 30 seconds

545
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,670
to see if you're lying.

546
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,780
I didn't lie.

547
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,350
Why are you blushing?

548
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,790
I'm not blushing.

549
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,720
Are you thinking of Jiang Yu Cheng?

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,630
No.

552
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,790
you should know what's good or bad.

553
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,630
Don't be grateful to others

554
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,030

ask you in person.

783

I've seen a lot of editors

784

785
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,510
Mr Jiang, please don't get mad.

786
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,430
I just have a few minor questions.

787
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,390
Minor.

788
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,860
You think I'm easily angered?

789
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,070
Look here.

790
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,350
Will the plot about Lu Yan
be a little far-fetched?

791
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,590
I know that readers nowadays

792
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,540
like to read about this stuff.

793
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,180
But the plot here seems to be

794
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,790
inconsistent with his persona.

795
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,990
If this is your plot,

796
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,350
the persona of the character will be ruined.

797
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,990
You have to consider whether
the reader likes it or not.

798
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,310
As long as readers like it,

799
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,110
it's okay to let it ruin a little.

I don't think

802
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,660
