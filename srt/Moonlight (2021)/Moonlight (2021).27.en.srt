[Moonlight]

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 27]

4
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,300
Brother Cheng,

5
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,470
this is the fifth time

6
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,870
you've been wiping
the same piece of glass.

7
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,830
Is that so?

8
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,390
It's fine.

9
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,030
I'll take a look over there then.

10
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,390
-I'll rearrange them.
-No need for that.

11
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,789
I think the books are organized enough.

12
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,310
They'll be messy once again
if you go and rearrange them.

13
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,190
Brother, I think you should go and rest.

14
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,980
Stop messing things up for us.

15
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm messing things up?

16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,789
Pardon me for being straight,

17
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,270
but you've been no help to us
at all for the past two days.

18
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,530
You couldn't even do the accounts right.

19
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,590
Brother Cheng,

20
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,460
what's wrong with you?

21
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,990
I'm fine.

22
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,720
[Yun Fei]

23
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,230
Thank Mr Maurer for me.

24
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,750
See you next time.

25
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,829
Who is it?

26
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,390
Do you need anything?

27
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,950
Why didn't you tell me about the truth
about the plagiarism?

28
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,390
Come in.

29
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,100
It's been so many years.

30
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,670
I always thought

31
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,600
you were the one who told
Yun Fei about my idea.

32
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,770
Why didn't you
explain yourself to me at all?

33
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,320
How do I explain myself?

34
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,790
I always knew that

35
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,470
you two were using the same plot,

36
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,270
but I couldn't tell you about it.

37
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,950
Because I'm not just your girlfriend,

38
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,710
I'm an editor as well.

39
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,510
I couldn't say anything about it
even though

40
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,590
my boyfriend has been
writing it for the past six months.

41
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,430
It was tough for me as well.

42
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,070
Actually, you can tell me the truth.

43
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,350
Do you think the past you
would believe in me?

44
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,550
Actually, even if I told you the truth,

45
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,550
we would still end up like this.

46
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,149
Yun Fei's book

47
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,149
is just the final nail in the coffin.

48
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,370
Our problems existed a long time ago.

49
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,190
Our problem didn't arise
from the fact that

50
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,850
we didn't explain ourselves,

51
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,910
it's a matter of trust.

52
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,750
Jiang Yu Cheng,
you don't trust me at all.

53
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,510
It's not that I don't trust you.

54
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,110
As long as you told me that

55
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,950
you didn't tell him my idea,

56
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,720
I would've trusted you.

57
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,830
You see? That's the problem here.

58
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,790
When you asked me whether
I've told Yun Fei about your idea,

59
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,270
when you thought that you were
just my stepping stone,

60
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,330
it meant that you've lost trust in me.

61
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,730
The one sentence
you've been longing to hear

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,880
is the one sentence I don't want to say.

63
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,220
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,030
Before this,

65
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,500
you told me that we would end up
like this again.

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,710
I didn't believe you.

67
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,750
But now, I do believe you.

68
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,950
Maybe we're just

69
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,590
not meant for each other.

70
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,800
Please give me another chance.

71
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,110
I'm tired.

72
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,310
I'm really tired of it.

73
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,310
Instead of torturing each other again,

74
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,710
why don't we just let it go?

75
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,710
I still have work to do.

76
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,909
You can see yourself out.

77
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,830
Mr Zhou Chuan,

78
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,390
help me take a look.

79
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,120
What should I wear for work
for my reinstatement?

80
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,750
Both of them are fine.

81
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,590
No! These two outfits
have different meanings to them.

82
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,830
This outfit will show

83
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,990
my carefree attitude and tell them that

84
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,790
I won't care even if they fire me.

85
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,630
This outfit will show my bossy attitude

86
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,870
and make them cower in fear.

87
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,080
You should wear the carefree one then.

88
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,230
How about the bossy one?

89
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,070
I...

90
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,030
Just bring both of them.

91
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,990
You can wear one in the morning
and one in the evening.

92
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,910
I'm sure it'll be hot.
Besides, it's troublesome.

93
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,630
Give me a moment.

94
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,160
[Mum]

95
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,770
Hello, Mum? Do you need anything?

96
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,910
[It's me.]

97
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,230
[You wouldn't pick up my call]

98
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,960
[if I didn't call you using her phone,
am I right?]

99
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,950
Where's my mother?

100
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,070
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

101
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,790
[Look at your attitude.]

102
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,510
[You'll embarrass me]

103
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,310
[if I send you to see Maurer.]

104
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,750
Maurer?

105
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,590
Which Maurer are you talking about?

106
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,270
Which Maurer are you talking about?

107
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,230
He wants young writers

108
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,190
from Chinese mainland
to work on his new movie.

109
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,390
Send me a list and details

110
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,450
of all the writers under our company.

111
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,270
I'll send the list to him.

112
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,710
Maurer will meet with the person
he deemed suitable.

113
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,870
Yes, madam.

114
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,190
Why aren't you going?

115
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,050
Didn't you listen to what he said?

116
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,790
He said I was inferior

117
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,150
and I was an embarrassment to him.

118
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,520
Who needs his recommendation anyway?

119
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,580
You mustn't think of it in that way.

120
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,310
When Linghu Chong met Feng Qingyang,

121
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,270
even if he doesn't master
the Nine Swords of Dugu,

122
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,830
at least he got to meet his idol
and realize his dream.

123
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,310
Moreover, you're just sending
your resume to him.

124
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,990
They still need to filter it, you know?

125
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,270
I won't send it to him.

126
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,430
Gentlemen do not accept
food handed out in contempt.

127
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,980
I won't participate in anything

128
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,640
that old man recommends to me.

129
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,830
Fine, don't send it then.

130
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,270
Since Old Mr Zhou had recommended
Mr Jiang as well,

131
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,070
I'll ask him if he's going
to send his resume to him.

132
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,789
Who are you referring to?

133
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,020
Mr Jiang.

134
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,110
To him, this is a great opportunity.

135
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,470
And, I'm his editor as well

136
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,350
If you're not going,

137
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,610
naturally, I have to recommend him to go.

138
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,270
You're just his editor for one book.

139
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,910
The cooperation is over
once you've published his book.

140
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,310
I'm your current boyfriend

141
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,970
and future husband, you know?

142
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,390
My future husband?

143
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,110
You're thinking too far ahead.

144
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,990
How do you want me
to prove it to you then?

145
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,670
I'll prove it to you right now.

146
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,590
Weren't we talking about Maurer just now?

147
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,270
Don't try to shift the topic.

148
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,350
Anyway, I'm the Gan Jiang Mo Ye

149
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,670
of the editorial industry.

150
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,750
I'll have to depend on both of you

151
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,100
to make a name for myself in the industry.

152
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,270
Gan Jiang Mo Ye?

153
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,150
So, Jiang Yu Cheng and I

154
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,080
hold the same weight in your heart?

155
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,110
I'm

156
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,910
not

157
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,990
going!

158
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,870
What are you doing?

159
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,390
I...

160
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,700
Stop fiddling with my phone.

161
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,150
I wasn't fiddling with your phone.

162
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,310
I've arranged your details

163
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,020
and your published works.

164
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,880
-I've sent them to Maurer.
-Wait.

165
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,910
I...

166
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,230
I don't even have the right

167
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,310
to object to your decision now?

168
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,110
As your editor,

169
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,310
I'm fine with any decision you make,

170
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,430
even if you decide not to meet Maurer.

171
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,030
But, as your girlfriend,

172
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,830
I know you're just too stubborn
to admit the truth.

173
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,550
That was fast.

174
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,830
You're leaving already?

175
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,110
Remember to check your email.

176
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,670
They'll send you an email
once they have received it.

177
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,110
I'll go and change first.

178
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,190
I'm a busy man, you know?

179
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,590
I don't have time to check my email.

180
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,950
Mister, I was wrong.

181
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,550
You're the only man I can depend on.

182
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

183
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,870
Just ignore me.

184
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,360
What's wrong with you and
Gu Bai Zhi again?

185
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,470
She said

186
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,350
it was over for us.

187
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,220
Do you still like her then?

188
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,150
I do.

189
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,590
Not only do I like her,

190
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,870
I...

191
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,950
Stop recording!

192
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,470
I finally understand now.

193
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,630
You won't be able to

194
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,950
escape from her grasp in this lifetime.

195
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,950
It's either you pull yourself together

196
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,190
and get her back,

197
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,230
or stay here and die alone.

198
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,950
Chu Li and I

199
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,990
won't hold a funeral for you when you die.

200
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,940
Get her back?

201
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,950
How?

202
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,430
Maurer is coming to Chinese mainland.

203
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,590
He's looking for a writer.

204
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,030
None of the old writers

205
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,150
are to his liking.

206
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,390
He's looking for
a young and talented writer.

207
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,990
Xin Dun Books doesn't have
any qualified writers

208
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,510
to work with him, so...

209
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,360
I guess Gu Bai Zhi is frustrated
because of that fact.

210
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,960
Cherish your opportunity.

211
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,310
So, will you bring Mr Jiang

212
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,830
and Mr Zhou Chuan with you?

213
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,510
What has this got to do with me?

214
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,750
The writers were the ones
who were invited.

215
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,270
I think it depends on the writers
if they want to bring me along or not.

216
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,460
I think

217
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,920
Mr Zhou Chuan will surely
bring you with him.

218
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,250
We still don't know if he can
pass the selection.

219
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,940
As for Mr Jiang,

220
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,790
he isn't an avid reader of Maurer's works.

221
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,830
So, it's highly unlikely
for him to be there.

222
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,110
But, if he does go,

223
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,270
I will still cheer for him.

224
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,510
You need to balance your relationship
even during work.

225
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,830
It must've been tough.

226
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,790
I have no choice.

227
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,670
Both of them are young
and talented writers.

228
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,790
It's getting late. Let's go.

229
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,670
I think Chief Editor Yu has arrived.

230
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,470
I still need to thank her as well.

231
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,110
Thank me for what?

232
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,700
-Chief Editor Yu.
-Chief Editor Yu.

233
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,150
Miao told me that you two
are organizing the book shelves.

234
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,550
I came here to take a look.

235
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,100
We will be done soon.

236
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,870
Chief Editor Yu, thank you
for helping me with the reinstatement.

237
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,200
Why are you thanking me?

238
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,030
You were the one who managed to
convince writers like Ghost.

239
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,020
You were the one who
convinced Mr Xia as well.

240
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,280
Do your best, alright?

241
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,070
I will.

242
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,210
Why isn't there any news from Maurer yet?

243
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,190
Here you go.

244
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,650
[Email]

245
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,080

[Invitation for Mr Zhou Chuan]

247
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,270
What's wrong?

248
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,190
Nothing.

249
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,030
You look elated.

250
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,670
Did Maurer send you an email?

251
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,790
I did receive an invitation.

252
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,510
He wants to meet me in person.

253
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,430
Initially, I was planning to write.

254
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,270
This is so troublesome.

255
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,340
You're the best! You're my boy indeed!

256
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,470
I'll go and

257
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,910
pack our luggage right now.

258
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,110
By the way, when will you guys meet?

259
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,590
I...

260
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,460
[Invitation]

261
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,990
[Invitation for Mr Jiang Yu Cheng]

262
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,110
Even if you get to meet Maurer,

263
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,510
he won't be satisfied with our writers.

264
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,230
You should explain this to me then.

265
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,700
We have many writers, yet none of them
were able to enter the second selection?

266
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,990
Don't tell me Xin Dun Books

267
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,250
doesn't have even one qualified writer?

268
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,950
What's the use

269
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,280
of the content planning department then?

270
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,350
Gu Bai Zhi,

271
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,570
you can explain this
to our leader yourself.

272
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,150
Actually, you still have a trump card
up your sleeves.

273
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,750
Why are you here?

274
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,950
[Invitation]

275
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,700
Wednesday, 2pm.

276
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,030
I'll wait for you by your area's entrance.

277
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,830
You're planning to bring me along?

278
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,070
He only invited Zhou Chuan and I.

279
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,870
I can help you out.

280
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,470
Even if you were to be chosen,

281
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,900
it's a testament to your own ability.

282
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,630
It has nothing to do with us editors.

283
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,030
Besides, you and Xin Dun Books

284
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,490
have parted ways long ago.

285
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,790
How are you going to help me?

286
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,030
What if I let Xin Dun Books
publish my next book?

287
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,589
I'll go there

288
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,869
as a writer under Xin Dun Books.

289
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,910
Remember all the details.

290
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,670
Maurer is looking for a partner.

291
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,430
I'm sure Director Gu knows about that.

292
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,710
I wonder who she'll send to the battle?

293
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,760
I can only depend on you now,
my Dragon Slaying Sabre.

294
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,110
I've memorized everything

295
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,590
about Maurer.

296
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,450
I don't need to read them anymore.

297
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,750
Explain this to me then.

298
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,110
Until now, Maurer had published

299
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,630
seven novels.

300
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,380
But why are there only characters

301
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,640
from six of his novels listed
on the online encyclopaedia?

302
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,390
I didn't expect you to be that particular.

303
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,270
My goodness.

304
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,030
Don't tell me

305
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,510
you don't know what I'm talking about?

306
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,310
How dare you say that
you're an avid reader of his works?

307
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,540
I couldn't find the characters of
The Dragon's Mark on the Sky

308
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,300
no matter how I look.

309
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,390
That's strange.

310
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,350
Enough.

311
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,310
Just leave these matters to me.

312
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,630
You can deal with the logistics.

313
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,910
This is our first time

314
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,550
going on a trip together.

315
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,670
They say that

316
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,550
the final test between a couple

317
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,590
is to go on a trip together.

318
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,220
We won't break up with each other

319
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,030
after the trip, am I right?

320
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,150
That's impossible.

321
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,950
Here's a quiz.

322
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,140
Who will carry the luggage?

323
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,070
-Me.
-Who shall plan our schedule?

324
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,630
-You.
-Who shall govern our money?

325
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,420
You.

326
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,430
-How many rooms should we book?
-One...

327
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,830
I mean two.

328
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,270
That's more like it.

329
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,870
Isn't it a waste of money

330
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,110
for us to book two rooms?

331
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,590
You should focus on

332
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,030
reading Maurer's details.

333
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,760
Stop thinking about nonsense.

334
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,710
Who's thinking about nonsense?

335
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,230
Break up with each other?

336
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,990
It's just a trip.

337
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm sure it'll be fine.

338
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,380
Ten things to take note of

339
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,590
when you go on a trip
with your other half.

340
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,750
The one who isn't responsible
for the schedule

341
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,710
should keep quiet even if
they're hungry.

342
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,420
Don't talk back even if you're exhausted.

343
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,990
Let nature take its course so that

344
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,310
peace will be ensued? What is this?

345
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,350
[Do you still remember
your first trip with]

346
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,390
Gu Bai Zhi?

347
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,710
Please tell me

348
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,630
about your past failures

349
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,140
so that I could avoid them.

350
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,830
I do have some advice for you.

351
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,830
Just ask Chu Li to stay away from you.

352
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,110
I...

353
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,670
Let me do it.

354
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,190
I've worn the skirt you asked of me.

355
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,230
But, must I wear this ugly hat?

356
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,430
We aren't going on a vacation, you know?

357
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,830
When you're together with your boyfriend,

358
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,910
it's...

359
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,060
It's a vacation no matter where you go.

360
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,470
Look at your hat

361
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,460
and look at my outfit.

362
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,270
Take a closer look.

363
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,300
This way, people will be able to

364
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,350
identify us as a couple.

365
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,150
Mister,

366
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,010
why do I feel like
there's something wrong with you?

367
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,590
Don't worry, leave this to me.

368
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,470
Just don't talk back to me.

369
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,990
On the Internet,

370
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,350
it says a sense of ceremony
is very important

371
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,950
for our first trip together.

372
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,830
Your hat.

373
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,990
Wear it properly.

374
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,150
I think I should change my outfit.

375
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,230
Just get on the car.

376
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,900
Beware of the car's roof.

377
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,190
What kind of taste is this?

378
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,790
I think the hat is too big.

379
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,310
You've never liked wearing

380
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,310
matching outfits with me before.

381
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,990
Tell me, what's your motive?

382
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,950
It's all because of you.

383
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,670
Last night, you said
going on a trip together

384
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,590
is the biggest test for a couple.

385
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,030
So, it's because of that?

386
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,630
I'm sorry then.

387
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,750
The hat is worth is indeed.

388
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,350
You two

389
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,350
have a great relationship, huh?

390
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,470
You two must be colleagues.

391
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,680
Business trips are tough, huh?

392
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,390
This isn't my style at all.

393
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,340
Mr Jiang?

394
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,420
I thought you weren't coming.

395
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,790
Sorry, Chu Li.

396
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,590
I didn't tell you beforehand.

397
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,470
What are you saying?

398
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,190
Clearly, he has an ulterior motive.

399
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,570
Don't you understand?

400
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,270
What a fool.

401
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,550
You hear that?

402
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,590
You're a fool.

403
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,230
I'm sure he was enraged
because I exposed him.

404
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,870
I think you're a fool as well.

405
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,300
I...

406
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:06,990
Mr Jiang,

407
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,790
this is the room you've booked,
Room 3130.

408
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,870
Thank you.

409
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,350
Just one room?

410
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,030
You only booked one room?

411
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,830
How could I possibly do so?

412
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,710
At first,

413
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,030
I wasn't sure that you would come.

414
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,030
But it's fine.

415
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,310
I've booked another room on our way here.

416
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,990
But I couldn't get a room.

417
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,110
Please give me another room.

418
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,550
Any room is fine.

419
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,430
I'm really sorry.

420
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,550
Our hotel is fully booked.

421
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,550
There are no empty rooms available.

422
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,110
Hello, checking in for Zhou Chuan.

423
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,840
Alright, please wait a moment.

424
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,700
Mr Zhou Chuan, your rooms are Room 3165

425
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,460
and Room 3182.

426
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,750
Alright, thank you.

427
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,070
This is an emergency.
I'll pay you double for this.

428
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,590
Director Gu, I'll pay you triple for that.

429
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,820
There's no need for that.
It belongs to us in the first place.

430
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,110
Give me the card.

431
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,630
How about this?

432
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,590
Chu Li,

433
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,100
you can take my card.

434
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,350
I'll stay in Zhou Chuan's room.

435
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,280
I don't want you to sleep beside me.

436
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,550
You can take this.

437
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,980
My girlfriend and I can stay in one room.

438
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,550
That's great. Thank you so much.

439
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,760
I don't want to stay
in the same room as you!

440
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,750
She's gone.

441
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,310
Let's check

442
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,630
Mr Jiang's room out.

443
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,670
Let's go.

444
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,470
Mr Jiang is really generous.

445
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,740
There's only one bed?

446
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,470
How are we going to sleep?

447
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,070
Rule 8 of the tenants' rules,

448
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,310
-it is...
-I'll sleep on the sofa.

449
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,470
Is that okay with you?

450
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,470
That's more like it.

451
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,430
By the way,

452
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,830
regarding Maurer's
The Dragon's Mark on the Sky,

453
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,430
what was the story behind it?

454
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,350
Why are you still
concerned about that novel?

455
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,550
That day, Ah Xiang and I
searched the bookshelves.

456
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,350
We only managed to find some details
of it on some magazines.

457
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,550
It stated that Maurer hated the book
so much that

458
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,710
he denied the existence of the novel.

459
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,880
What exactly was the story behind it?

460
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,710
The Dragon's Mark on the Sky

461
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,600
[Maurer]

462
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,030
was actually created by Maurer
and his best friend,

463
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,310
Ymir.

464
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,350
After the novel was published,

465
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,510
Ymir wrote

466
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,550
an official fan fiction

467
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,270
in order to express

468
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,950
the reason for its creation
from his perspective.

469
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,620
So, this Ymir

470
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,630
had transformed a novel
that was advocating for peace

471
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,630
into a story where the Western dragon

472
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,830
won against the evil Eastern warlords?

473
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,910
That's right.

474
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,470
Doesn't that mean he has went against

475
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,790
Maurer's original intention
of writing the novel?

476
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,550
Yeah.

477
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,550
Maurer is

478
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,590
a total pacifist.

479
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,310
He visited Chinese mainland,
India, even Cambodia in the past.

480
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,670
He admired the Eastern culture.

481
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,430
But, Ymir

482
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,700
advocated violence and hatred.

483
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,230
So, all of a sudden,

484
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,670
all of the pacifists

485
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,430
turned their spears towards Maurer
because of this incident.

486
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,070
They fell out with each other
after that incident.

487
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,830
Now, this novel

488
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,670
is a taboo to Mr Maurer.

489
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,140
So, you mustn't mention this novel
to him when you see him.

490
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,630
Alright.

491
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,190
I'm sure it was hard to gather

492
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,350
all these information, huh?

493
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,670
It's not that bad.

494
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,710
Thank you.

495
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,270
Don't mention it.

496
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,790
Take a good look at them.

497
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,510
You can find me if you have any questions

498
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,830
regarding them.

499
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,750
Let's have dinner together.

500
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,990
We can call Zhou Chuan and Chu Li
to join us.

501
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,110
I'll skip that.

502
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,350
I'm not hungry.

503
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,780
I'll skip dinner as well then.

504
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
I won't die even if I skip some meals.

505
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,350
At most, I'll just be pale and weak

506
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,950
when I meet Maurer tomorrow.

507
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,590
Hey, do you think

508
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,550
we should remind Mr Jiang?

509
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,030
Don't underestimate Gu Bai Zhi.

510
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,030
I'm sure Jiang Yu Cheng

511
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,030
will know more about Maurer than me.

512
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,870
If Gu Bai Zhi wants to
work together with someone,

513
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,070
no one will be able to stop her.

514
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,210
Zhou Chuan, let's have dinner together.

515
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,630
Chu Li,

516
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,170
we'll wait for you at the restaurant.

517
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,950
This is the quietest meal

518
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,590
I've ever had in my entire life.

519
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,220
Let's not eat with them in the future.

520
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,910
Even my tummy is hurting.

521
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,510
Really?

522
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,710
He's lying.

523
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,440
And we can hear what
you guys are saying, you know?

524
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,550
Come.

525
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,670
Now, I don't like fish eyes.

526
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,910
I'll remember that.

527
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,430
Ms Gu,

528
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,960
since when have you stopped
liking fish eyes?

529
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,470
Even people will change as time goes by.

530
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,950
Moreover, this is just a change of taste.

531
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,590
Isn't this normal?

532
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,070
Ms Gu, since you said

533
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,310
you had a change of taste,

534
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,230
so, what do you prefer to eat lately?

535
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,350
Crab roe,

536
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,790
broad bean,

537
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,430
and Houttuynia cordata.

538
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,590
I thought Mr Jiang
disliked all of those food?

539
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,950
Ms Gu, besides those...

540
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,710
Chu Li is an avid reader
of Jiang Yu Cheng's works indeed.

541
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,630
Seems like you're very clear
about his preferences.

542
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,830
She knows my preferences even better.

543
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,350
If I'm not mistaken,

544
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,230
you booked two rooms, right?

545
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,950
Yeah.

546
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,750
I thought you guys were a couple?

547
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,550
Does that mean we need to
stay in the same room?

548
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,750
We did so out of mutual respect.

549
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,550
But you guys seem like a happy couple

550
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,760
with no problems whatsoever, huh?

551
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,710
Why do I feel like

552
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,710
you're trying to drive a wedge between us?

553
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,990
I think I'm done.

554
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,340
Please enjoy your dinner.

555
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,470
I!

556
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,820
Why did you fall into her trap so easily?

557
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,750
Why do I need you in the first place?

558
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,670
So, I'm in the wrong for trying to help?

559
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,750
It's getting late.

560
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,750
-You should bathe first.
-You should bathe first.

561
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,410
-I'll bathe first then.
-I'll bathe first then.

562
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,150
I'll bathe first.

563
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,870
You're not allowed to peek.

564
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,910
Do you think I want to take a peek?

565
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,510
-Who's there?
-It's me.

566
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,150
Let's take a walk.

567
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,630
Take a walk? I'm going to take my bath.

568
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,470
Great timing. You can bathe
after you're done walking.

569
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,310
No. I'm in a bad mood.

570
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,990
Hurry and put your clothes on.

571
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,950
Don't catch a cold. Hurry up.

572
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,910
It's lucky that I brought my own shampoo.

573
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,550
My hair smells nice.

574
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,870
How do I make my face look smaller?

575
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,230
I'm done.

576
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,380
Where is he?

577
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,870
Zhou Chuan?

578
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,310
Hello? Where are you?

579
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,510
[Jiang Yu Cheng invited me for a walk.
I'll be back later.]

580
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,030
Don't stay out too late, okay?

581
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,110
We need to meet Maurer tomorrow, you know?

582
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,390
[Alright, I'll hang up now.]

583
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,510
What should I say

584
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,910
in order to make her forgive me?

585
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,110
Calm down.

586
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,940
You must stay calm.

587
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,470
Your impulse will ruin you.

588
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,750
Actually, I have many things
that I want to tell her.

589
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,540
But when I see her in person,

590
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,200
I can't bring myself to speak.

591
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,350
Why don't we continue our walk?

592
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,200
We can take as long as we want to.

593
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,230
Are you even listening to me?

594
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,790
What did you say again?

595
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,700
When we meet Maurer tomorrow,

596
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:27,680
-we mustn't mention his maiden work.
-We mustn't mention his maiden work.

597
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,590
Seems like the she-devil
has told you everything.

598
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,000
Seems like you're a true fan of Maurer.

599
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,830
Do you want to catch some fishes?

600
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,870
You're so childish.

601
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,870
Look.

602
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,949
That girl over there loves it
when she sees cute animals.

603
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,310
I'm sure my girl will love them.

604
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,150
But, it's hard to say

605
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,710
for the she-devil.

606
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,469
She was fond of

607
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,909
my parents' cat in the past.

608
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,270
You said so yourself.
It's all in the past.

609
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,310
Now, I guess

610
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,110
she's fond of acquiring your head.

611
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,510
Why are you trying to steal my fish?

612
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,110
-Do you think the fish tank is yours?
-I...

613
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,710
I want the black fish as well.

614
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,409
You want to act like a thug?

615
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,060
Fine.

616
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,909
Let's compete then.

617
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,830
Alright.

618
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,030
They're strange.

619
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,750
Let's go to somewhere else.

620
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,710
Why isn't he back yet?

621
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,710
You're back?

622
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,870
What are you hiding behind you?

623
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,430
It's a surprise.

624
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,770
[Don't tell me he's finally
buying flowers for me?]

625
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,510
Give it to me.

626
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,470
Fishes?

627
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,430
I've spent so much effort
in order to get them.

628
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,270
And Jiang Yu Cheng

629
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,150
wanted the black fish for himself as well.

630
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,030
I lied to him

631
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,950
and said that Gu Bai Zhi was behind him.

632
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,150
I caught it when he was flustered.

633
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,990
Do you like it?

634
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,300
That's kind of interesting.

635
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,270
I've named them as well.

636
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,470
The black and cool fish

637
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,630
is Zhou Chuan.

638
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,940
For the red and chubby fish,

639
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,470
it's Chu Li.

640
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,870
Actually, I don't mind you

641
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,510
praising me for my beauty.

642
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,520
You don't like them?

643
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,590
That Jiang Yu Cheng,

644
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,510
he told me that

645
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,430
girls like small animals like these.

646
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,350
That's why I...

647
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,030
I like them.

648
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,710
I like everything you give me.

649
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,430
The editorial department has

650
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,950
a jar of goldfish as well.

651
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,680
I'll find a container for them.

652
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,190
Look.

653
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,350
They were in the same plastic bag

654
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,590
as I brought them home.

655
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,470
It wasn't embarrassing for them at all.

656
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,730
So, I'm sure we can work this out somehow.

657
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,230
What's wrong?

658
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,990
Where's my fish?

659
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,870
Zhou...

660
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,270
Zhou Chuan was
flushed into the toilet bowl.

661
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,950
I'm sure you wanted to do that long ago.

662
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,870
It's not that.

663
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,390
I just wanted to flush away
the toilet paper.

664
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,550
I didn't expect Zhou Chuan
to jump out from the container.

665
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,830
And it...

666
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,430
This is a huge sin.

667
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,070
Maybe you just did a good deed?

668
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,070
Maybe it could survive even better

669
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,870
when it reaches the sewer?

670
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,310
Really?

671
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,670
Will this goldfish
be able to survive then?

672
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,270
Haven't you read about

673
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,270
goldfishes experiencing atavism?

674
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,190
When goldfishes reach the sewer,

675
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,350
they'll experience atavism
and turn into carps.

676
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,630
After that, they'll produce offspring

677
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,140
and live a good life down in the sewers.

678
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,540
Can you stop telling me nonsense

679
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,340
while putting on a serious face?

680
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,990
Why don't you

681
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,420
come in?

682
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,790
I just want you to
have a comfortable sleep.

683
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,030
I don't mean anything else.

684
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,310
Hey,

685
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,030
Rule 8 of the tenants' rules,

686
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,310
you mustn't be too close to me.

687
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,270
And, you're not allowed to...

688
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,390
Let's sleep.

689
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,270
Good night.

690
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,660

My relative is here.

708
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,510
