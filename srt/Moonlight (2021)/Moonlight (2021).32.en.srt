[English subtitles are available]

00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,970
[Moonlight]

3
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 32]

4
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,870
[Two-faced?]

5
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,150
[Are you sure?]

6
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,990
[Yes.]

7
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,990
[He's great at maintaining
his image, isn't he?]

8
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,110
[The Gentle and Kind Mr Chuan.]

9
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,310
[But my friend told me that]

10
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,780
[he's got a really bad temper.]

11
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,390
[He's ambitious but incompetent.]

12
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,990
[When he was signing for
Book of Luo He God,]

13
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,120
[he asked for the same minimum
print run of a top author.]

14
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,630
[Who does he think he is?]

15
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,390
[Do all the editors from
Yuan Yue Publishing House]

16
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,270
[know what kind of person he is?]

17
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,550
[More than half of them know.]

18
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,750
[Except some diehard fans of his.]

19
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,110
[He has fans in the editorial department?]

20
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,070
[There's more.]

21
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,330
[Zhou Chuan's girlfriend is there too.]

22
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,710
[It's very complicated inside.]

23
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,750
[They mix business with personal matters.]

24
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,500
[And there are many backdoor deals.]

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,150
[Don't tell me his girlfriend]

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,190
[is the editor of the Book of Luo He God?]

27
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,310
[I don't know about that.]

28
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,750
[But my friend said that]

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,670
[they are tighter than that.]

30
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,829
[She joined them two years ago,]

31
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:32,750
[yet she managed to sign up
Jiang Yu Cheng and Zhou Chuan.]

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,140
[Are you saying that]

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,590
[she signed them up through unjust means?]

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,950
[I didn't say that.]

35
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,910
[Just wait for their official statement.]

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,470
[If they stand up for Zhou Chuan,]

37
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,070
[it must have something to do
with the editor.]

38
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,350
[After all,]

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,829
[do you think they would]

40
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:49,760
[believe that Zhou Chuan
didn't use a ghostwriter?]

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,230
The ghostwriting rumours

42
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,630
aren't over yet.

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,230
And now the recording.

44
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,220
Not only the editorial department,

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,910
even Yuan Yue Publishing House
was dragged into this.

46
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,470
Official statement?

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,410
What official statement?

48
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,460
He's talking nonsense and
making irresponsible remarks.

49
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,430
Why should Zhou Chuan

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,630
and Yuan Yue Publishing House
take the blame for what he said?

51
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,030
You think you can reason
with the netizens?

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,430
At this point,

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,260
if we were to stand up for Zhou Chuan,

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,670
it will further prove that

55
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,460
what he said is true.

56
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,190
Who is this person?

57
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,090
An anonymous whistleblower.

58
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,620
His voice was fake.

59
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,520
We have no idea who he is.

60
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,350
This recording

61
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,230
has gone viral on the Internet.

62
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,150
They not only
called Yuan Yue Publishing House

63
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,740
unscrupulous

64
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,810
but also dragged Chu Li into this.

65
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,140
Song Xi's assistant

66
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,150
liked this recording.

67
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,829
Cocoon popped up and reaffirmed

68
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,470
that you were flirting with Chu Li

69
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,530
when you guys were working together.

70
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,870
Giving them two pieces of evidence.

71
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,829
Then...

72
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,510
Mr Liang,

73
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,440
how would you like things handled?

74
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,990
Now,

75
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,830
we'll release a statement
on behalf of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

76
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,950
Saying that

77
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,630
we won't defend any writers.

78
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,790
We'll put our contract
with Zhou Chuan on hold

79
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,310
until the truth is revealed.

80
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,630
How could you do this?

81
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,750
I've given him enough leeway.

82
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,630
Once he proves that he's innocent,

83
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,620
Yuan Yue Publishing House is still
willing to work with him.

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,350
You know how aggressive the netizens are.

85
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,710
If you don't defend him,

86
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,750
the official statement

87
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,190
will affirm that Zhou Chuan
did use a ghostwriter.

88
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,110
I don't care whether
he used a ghostwriter or not.

89
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,470
Do you understand?

90
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,070
All I care about is whether it will

91
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,930
taint the reputation of
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

92
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,659
Chu Li,

93
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,350
do you know what they said about us?

94
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,940
They accused

95
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,270
Yuan Yue Publishing House
of serious nepotism.

96
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,820
That all we care about is money.

97
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,350
That we're gross and dirty.

98
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,390
All sorts of accusations!

99
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,830
If other writers were affected

100
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,030
because of this and

101
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,670
it has an impact on our sales,

102
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,990
can the two of you

103
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,990
take the responsibility for it?

104
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,990
Are we going to abandon

105
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,550
our writer at this point in time?

106
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,460
Chu Li,

107
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,470
at this point in time,

108
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,000
you need to be clear whether

109
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,500
you're Zhou Chuan's girlfriend

110
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,370
or an employee
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

111
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,790
I know what you want to do.

112
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,180
But if you admit

113
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,230
your relationship with Chu Li,

114
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,930
you'll put her at
the centre of controversy.

115
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,590
I don't understand.

116
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,470
I'm just a writer,

117
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,350
not a celebrity.

118
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,110
I was just writing my books at home.

119
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,950
How did I get into this mess?

120
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,670
And now Chu Li was dragged into this.

121
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,710
You're more concerned about

122
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,110
Chu Li than yourself.

123
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,990
I understand that.

124
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,590
But you should stop posting

125
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,520
anything that's related to Chu Li.

126
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,830
The more you said,

127
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,350
the worse it gets.

128
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,030
Keep calm.

129
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,580
Don't act rashly.

130
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,270
We don't know

131
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,130
how it'll turn out at Chu Li's end.

132
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,420
Be patient.

133
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,990
Seems like Mr Zhou Chuan and you
have offended many people.

134
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,850
You even got yourself
an anonymous whistleblower.

135
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,470
Mr Liang's told the legal department
to draft the statement.

136
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,180
Even if Mr Xia were to come back,

137
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,630
I bet Director Yang won't
change his decision.

138
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,690
Let them release the statement then.

139
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,470
I thought you were going to do something.

140
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,190
But it's okay,

141
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,110
Mr Zhou Chuan is your boyfriend after all.

142
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,970
He'll understand why you give in.

143
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,630
Who says I'm going to give in?

144
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,460
Bai Zhi,

145
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,750
have you heard about Zhou Chuan?

146
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,150
Mr Luo,

147
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,230
we make books, not chasing after gossip.

148
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,390
Yes, we make books.

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,550
So, I advise you to act with caution.

150
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,909
You might want to stop reprinting

151
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,390
Zhou Chuan's Huang Quan Inn.

152
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,500
-We're...
-Gu Bai Zhi!

153
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,230
It's non-negotiable.

154
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,230
Stop the re-printing immediately!

155
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,350
Director,

156
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,150
Mr Zhou Chuan's editor posted on Weibo.

157
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,230
And Yuan Yue Publishing House released

158
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,110
the official statement at the same time.

159
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,630
I'll have a look at it.

160
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,270
[Hello, everyone. I'm Chu Li.]

161
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,190
[I'm one of the editors
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.]

162
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,190
[I'm also Mr Zhou Chuan's editor.]

163
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,710
[The reason I'm posting this is because]

164
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,770
[I've got two things to let you know.]

165
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,790
[First of all,]

166
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,390
[what was said in the recording]

167
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,710
[has been maliciously manipulated.]

168
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,750
[Second of all,]

169
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,350
[Mr Zhou Chuan never hired a ghostwriter.]

170
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,750
[No matter who the ghostwriter is,]

171
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,990
[he would never do that.]

172
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,510
[He's above that.]

173
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,660
[And I believe, one day,]

174
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,070
[the truth will be revealed to you.]

175
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,690
[Posted]

176
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,909
Chu Li,

177
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,630
you're such a fighter. Why did you...

178
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,150
I've contacted Suo Heng and Ghost.

179
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,470
I told them not to get involved.

180
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,780
I can't drag them into this.

181
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,110
Aren't you afraid of getting implicated?

182
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,030
Chu Li!

183
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,430
Chu Li!

184
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,430
What did I ever do to you?

185
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,830
Why do you always pick on me?

186
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,110
I just released the statement

187
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,390
and you gave me a smack
in the face right after that.

188
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,520
What does that mean?

189
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,270
Do you want to lose your job?

190
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm an editor of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

191
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,950
that's why I need to speak up!

192
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,950
I've been Zhou Chuan's
editor since the beginning!

193
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,870
I know him

194
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,070
better than any one of you!

195
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,070
I know him well! He would never do that!

196
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,510
If Yuan Yue Publishing House is not
going to support him, I will!

197
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,910
Fine, you're a man of honour!

198
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,390
Now get lost!

199
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,110
How dare you tell Chu Li to get lost?

200
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,390
Mr Xia, I thought tomorrow...

201
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,430
Tomorrow?

202
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,350
Tomorrow, I'm afraid you'll fire everyone

203
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,010
in the editorial department.

204
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,430
We'll have a meeting now.

205
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,630
Let's go.

206
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,150
Mr Xia, have some drinks.

207
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,790
Liang.

208
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,630
Liang,

209
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,670
what do you mean by your statement?

210
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,950
We not only did not

211
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,790
have our writers' back,

212
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,030
we also pushed them
into the abyss of a disaster.

213
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,910
Hurry up

214
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,830
and withdraw the statement.

215
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,070
Mr Xia,

216
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,110
calm down.

217
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,510
It's bad for your health.

218
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,890
For your information,

219
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,180
Director Yang gave me a call this morning.

220
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,940
He made it clear that

221
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,580
he doesn't want Yuan Yue Publishing House

222
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,830
to get involved in this dispute.

223
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,030
But now you want me
to withdraw the statement.

224
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,750
You're putting me in a difficult position.

225
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,230
Why don't you give Director Yang a call?

226
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,070
Even though Director Yang
has given his order,

227
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,190
it's our job to release the statement.

228
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,430
Mr Liang,

229
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,390
you're overstepping your boundaries.

230
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,790
You're walking all over us,

231
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,510
you know?

232
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,440
Chief Editor Yu,

233
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,930
where's your manners?

234
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,070
I'm cleaning up the mess
for the editorial department.

235
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,950
Mr Liang,

236
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,470
you acted totally different

237
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,420
when Zhou Chuan got nominated.

238
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,270
The man of honour,

239
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,330
you're still here.

240
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,390
Didn't you say you'll leave?

241
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,310
Leave then.

242
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,550
You don't need to

243
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,190
come back to Yuan Yue anymore.

244
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,590
I won't withdraw the statement.

245
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,910
And Mr Xia,

246
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,110
let me make myself clear.

247
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,470
I won't do anything

248
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,270
without Director Yang's order.

249
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,430
You...

250
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,670
Mr Xia!

251
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,270
Are you okay?

252
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,070
Call the ambulance!

253
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,870
Okay!

254
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,150
You're back.

255
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,310
How's Mr Xia?

256
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,630
His blood pressure went down

257
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,430
and he's stable now.

258
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,350
Mr Xia wanted me to tell you that

259
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,310
it wasn't our decision

260
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,830
to release the statement.

261
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,350
He will talk to Director Yang

262
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,670
and give you a reasonable explanation.

263
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,350
Tell Mr Xia to get plenty of rest

264
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,110
and not to worry about me.

265
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,710
Did Liang Chong Lang

266
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,310
fire you today?

267
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,340
Ah Xiang told you about that?

268
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,100
I'm fine.

269
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,830
No matter what, he has to

270
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,510
show respect to Mr Xia.

271
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,710
He didn't fire me.

272
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,910
He just demoted me to intern.

273
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,270
What's with that look?

274
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,110
This isn't

275
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,230
the first time my career
hit a bump in the road.

276
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,790
I had a close call today,

277
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,550
but it's all right now.

278
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,990
I have to take the call.

279
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,150
Hello,

280
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,940
Mum.

281
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,670
You know I'm still your mother?

282
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,150
Tell me,

283
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,110
what's the nonsense

284
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,910
about the ghostwriting rumour?

285
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,390
It's become the talk of the town.

286
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,910
[What did I tell you?]

287
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,550
[I told you not to go to Shanghai.]

288
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,470
But you never listened to me.

289
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,190
You got your fingers burned now.

290
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,990
Did you call me

291
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,630
just to teach me a lesson?

292
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,150
[Duh!]

293
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,790
I've heard the recording.

294
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,710
Tell me,

295
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,750
did you offend anyone?

296
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,870
[I've told you again and again]

297
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,670
that you have to hold your temper.

298
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,070
Look at what has happened now.

299
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,150
Mum,

300
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,070
today...

301
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,790
My boss collapsed and
was taken to the hospital

302
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,790
while trying to defend me.

303
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,310
Is he okay now?

304
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,390
He's fine.

305
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,650
He was taken to the hospital just in time.

306
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,110
Oh my God.

307
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,630
I'm glad he's fine.

308
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,190
Darling,

309
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,630
you must never forget

310
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,590
his kindness.

311
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,110
Did you hear me?

312
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,510
[One more thing,]

313
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,030
about the ghostwriting rumour,

314
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,150
is it real?

315
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,660
Of course not!

316
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,550
That's good to hear.

317
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,670
I know my daughter

318
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,470
will never do that kind of thing.

319
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,230
[This]

320
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,340
[has become the talk of the town.]

321
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,100
[You must handle the problem nicely]

322
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,270
and teach them a lesson.

323
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,230
Don't come home if you can't

324
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,470
settle the problem.

325
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,910
[The word "deserter"
is not in my dictionary.]

326
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,990
[You hear that?]

327
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,070
Alright, you were the one

328
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,270
who acted up so that we'd
let you become an editor.

329
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,430
[Now that you've become an editor,]

330
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,790
[you must take it seriously]

331
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,460

Thanks, Mum.

335
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,750
[I won't keep you any longer.]

336
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,670
Take good care of yourself.

If you need more money,

340
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,430
call your dad.

341
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,830

Maybe

355
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,870
I should stop writing.

What are you talking about?

357
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,840

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,070
on an unworthy writer.

373
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,480
That's not true.

374
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,870
Zhou Chuan,

375
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,110
listen to me.

376
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,600
♫ The paper plane is flying against the wind ♫

377
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,590
I know

378
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,470
you don't need an editor.

379
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,830
You don't need anyone to

380
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,390
plan your career for you.

381
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,780
♫ Writing the warmest diary in light ink ♫

382
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,510
And you don't believe in anyone.

383
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,430
Just this once...

384
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,710
Just this once,

385
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,470
can you trust me?

386
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,070
♫ I won't simply let go of my dreams ♫

387
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,830
Don't give up.

388
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,110
We can solve this problem together.

389
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:40,620
♫ The higher I fly, the closer
I get to the meteor ♫

390
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,270
[I'm a newbie.]

391
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm nothing compared to the other

392
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,390
famous editors who wanted to sign you up.

393
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,350
But I have something they don't have,

394
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,240
♫ I may still feel lonely ♫

395
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,810
which is my willingness to lose everything.

396
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,140
Mr Zhou Chuan, could you

397
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,460
please consider me for the position?

398
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,860
♫ Just one message from you makes me happy ♫

399
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,150
I really want to be the editor in charge
of the Book of Luo He God.

400
00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:01,100
♫ Don't say I fulfil you, it just so happens ♫

401
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,310
If this is something

402
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,350
that you don't want to talk about,

403
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,630
I'm willing to help you
move away from the past.

404
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,590
Come with me,

405
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,589
to the bright future ahead of us.

406
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:11,160
♫ Please don't cry,
there will always be an answer ♫

407
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,420
♫ That will bring you good luck ♫

408
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:22,770
♫ We don't fulfil each other,
it just so happens ♫

409
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,030
Come home with me.

410
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:30,810
♫ It just so happens
that we are together ♫

411
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,350
Er Gou, we're going on a little trip.

412
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,350
Mr Jiang will come and
take care of you later.

413
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,070
Behave yourself.

414
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,670
Hello?

415
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,590
What?

416
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,270
Okay, I got it.

417
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,070
What's wrong?

418
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,540
Ah Xiang said that

419
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,710
Miao suddenly resigned just now.

420
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,710
What's even weirder is that

421
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,870
they can't get hold of

422
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,910
10 senior writers
of Yuan Yue Publishing House

423
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,270
once he resigned.

424
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,190
They haven't even submitted their work.

425
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,390
You suspect that

426
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,320
Miao has something to do with this?

427
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,390
I can't be sure about that.

428
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,700
But if that's true,

429
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,910
we'd have trouble publishing
the next issue of Moonlight Magazine.

430
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,710
Yuan Yue Publishing House
would be in big trouble!

431
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,870
This won't do, I need to go to the office.

432
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,070
You must let me know

433
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,190
if you need my help.

434
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,070
I know.

435
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,150
Go home first.

436
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,310
I'll come back to you

437
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,100
once I sort things out.

438
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,740
Bye.

439
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,870
Slow down.

440
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,230
Miao,

441
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,950
you're in charge of more than
half of the writers.

442
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,870
Don't you dare say you know nothing.

443
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,910
Enough,

444
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,110
Chief Editor Yu.

445
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,230
Starting from today,

446
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,790
I'm no longer a member
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

447
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,630
Stop making

448
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,270
false accusations against me.

449
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,630
You should think about

450
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,510
what you're going to explain

451
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,040
to Director Yang and Mr Xia.

452
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,070
I haven't even approved
your resignation letter.

453
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,980
I won't impose upon you then.

454
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,270
I'll take my annual leave first.

455
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,110
Bye.

456
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,110
Guys,

457
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,430
there will be no farewell party.

458
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,030
So long, farewell!

459
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,150
Okay. Thank you, Ms Suo Heng.

460
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,310
Hello, Ghost.

461
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,670
Could you please write two more articles

462
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,400
that comply with
the publication requirements?

463
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,590
Yes.

464
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,310
I don't have time to explain it.

465
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,350
Please.

466
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,750
Isn't this

467
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,930
Chu Li, the golden intern
of Yuan Yue Publishing House?

468
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,350
Why isn't Mr Zhou Chuan here?

469
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,100
He's involved in so many scandals that

470
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,630
he's got no time for you, right?

471
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,750
Miao,

472
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,350
do you have anything to do
with the writers?

473
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,820
It has nothing to do with me.

474
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,270
I'm no longer an employee
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

475
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,950
If you don't want people to know it,

476
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,590
the best way is not to do it.

477
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,830
Even if you deny it today,

478
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,990
you'll show the cloven hoof eventually.

479
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,270
You've been here for so long,

480
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,590
why would you make things
difficult for us?

481
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,050
It's not too late to
make the right decision.

482
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,150
Chu Li,

483
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,200
even though I'm no longer an employee,

484
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,330
I've had more than 10 years
of experience in this field.

485
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,470
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

486
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,590
Do I need you to tell me

487
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,350
what to do

488
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,310
and what's right or wrong?

489
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,870
Do you know why I hate you so much?

490
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,270
I hate the way you

491
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,710
put up a pretentious show

492
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,940
and

493
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,630
think that you have

494
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,580
the ability to change the world.

495
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,670
That you can be an editor

496
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,790
who not only takes the writers'
feelings into account

497
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,430
but also brings benefits to Yuan Yue.

498
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,030
You call yourself an editor?

499
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,230
You're just a dreamer, kiddo.

500
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,950
Well,

501
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,110
now you've single-handedly

502
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,830
ruined Zhao Chuan.

503
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,160
Yuan Yue Publishing House is also
screwed up because of you.

504
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,430
I've got words for you.

505
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,790
You deserved it!

506
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,480
Do you hate Zhou Chuan and me that much?

507
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,350
Not just that much

508
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,350
but very much.

509
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,550
You're the anonymous
whistleblower, aren't you?

510
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,270
You know the details of

511
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,030
marketing planning very well.

512
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,400
You were also the first person
who contacted Zhou Chuan.

513
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,870
And you hate Zhou Chuan and me the most.

514
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,550
I'm such an idiot.

515
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,950
I've underestimated your shamelessness.

516
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,150
If you have no evidence at all,

517
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,390
I can sue you for defamation.

518
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,230
How is it?

519
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,580
They won't pick up the call.

520
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,670
It's okay, keep trying.

521
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,710
Hello, Director Yang.

522
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,390
Miao Jian could have resigned anytime

523
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,910
but he chose to resign
when I'm on vacation!

524
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,950
Sis Xian Xian,

525
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,390
what are you doing here?

526
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,740
If I don't come back now,

527
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,470
I'm going to lose my job.

528
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,350
We only have two days before the deadline.

529
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,150
How many writers agreed to help?

530
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,350
I've got Ghost and Suo Heng...

531
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,270
Alright.

532
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,390
Sort out

533
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,390
all the categories of manuscripts you need

534
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,790
and send the file to me.

535
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,190
I'll ask my writers
to write more articles.

536
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,270
Okay.

537
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,830
I'd never thought I'd see

538
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,670
the day Sis Xian Xian returned to work.

539
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,110
You're back.

540
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,230
Son, you're back.

541
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,430
Come here.

542
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,270
Son,

543
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,430
I knew you'd come back at this hour.

544
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,390
You've lost weight.

545
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,710
You're even skinnier than
the last time I saw you.

546
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,270
I think he looks great.

547
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,110
You should

548
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,150
get a new pair of glasses.

549
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,990
Mum,

550
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,670
I'll take my luggage upstairs first.

551
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,190
Go then.

552
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,470
Listen,

553
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,470
our son

554
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,030
is upset because of

556
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,550
You'd better watch what you say.

557
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,910
I'm upset too.

558
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,950
Why didn't you tell him not to bother me?

559
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,950
You're nothing compared to our son.

560
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,380
Old Zhou,

561
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,630
give our son a bowl of soup.

562
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,630
It's okay, Mum.

563
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,990
I'll do it myself.

564
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,640
That's what you're supposed to do.

565
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,390
How old are you?

566
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,990
How dare you
let your elders serve you.

567
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,470
Where's your manners?

568
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,870
Why are you kicking me?

569
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,350
Did I say anything wrong?

570
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,150
No, you didn't.

571
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,230
Good.

572
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,390
We don't care

573
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,390
about the rumours at all.

574
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,780
Now that you're back,

575
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,310
you should take a good rest.

576
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,510
Dad, about this...

577
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,230
As long as you didn't do anything wrong,

578
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,030
you won't fall down.

579
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,950
You need to

580
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,510
solve your own problems.

581
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,300
Man

I know.

584
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,390
Not enough articles?

585
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,710
That bad?

586
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,630
I have several manuscripts.

587
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,790
I'll send it to you later.

588
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,630
Okay.

590
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,310
You're...

591
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,750
Helping you.

592
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,300
You know what I want to do?

593
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,910
Find out the similarities
between Zhou Chuan's

594
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,570
and his dad's writing, right?

595
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,500
But the mere analysis of
the Book of Luo He God is not enough.

596
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,230
It'd be better if you have
more samples, isn't it?

597
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,310
Yes.

598
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,910
Send my copy to Zhou Chuan as well.

599
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,830
The sooner this is over,

600
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,030
the sooner I can reprint Huang Quan Inn.

601
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,110
Okay.

602
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,670
Dad.

603
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,390
-Recently...
-Son.

604
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,350
Here, eat some grapes.

605
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,510
I'm good, Mum. I'm...

606
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,890
Eat it. She has washed the grapes for you.

607
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,350
Don't force him to eat.

608
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,950
He can decide whether
he wants to eat or not.

609
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,710
Look

610
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,470
how spoilt he is.

611
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,310
So what? I'm happy.

612
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,790

00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,910
When the ghostwriting rumour

708
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,110
first started,

709
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,310
he asked someone to put him on the show.

710
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,350
And they are airing it today.

711
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,550
I couldn't believe it as well.

Yes.

719

724
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,470

Yuan Yue for so many years...

No.

733
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,710
What's actually going on?

734
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,040
You must have some idea.

735
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,070
Even if I do, why should I tell you?

736
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,310
Why?

737
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,030
Because

738
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,590
you're staying.

739
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,710
Mr He Ma recommended you.

740
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,750
Now that we couldn't get hold of him,

741
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,020
you'd naturally be
the first person we'd come to.

742
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,430
If you're colluding with Miao,

743
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,710
you would have left with him.

744
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,950
But you chose to stay here.

745
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,030
Which means you don't
agree with him as well.

746
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,950
So what?

747
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,630
Why should I help you?

748
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,590
You wouldn't have stayed

749
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,510
if you're not passionate
about this career.

750
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,590
Are you kidding me?

751
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,430
To me,

752
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,070
this is nothing but a job.

753
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,590
Is that what you're really thinking about?

754
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,990
We all know

755
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,030
that Yuan Yue Publishing House

756
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,830
isn't the best one in this industry.

757
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,230
What keeps us here

758
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,110
are the passion and bond we shared.

759
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,710
I have no idea what you're talking about.

760
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,030
Here's

761
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,790
where I met Mr Zhou Chuan,

762
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,310
Mr Jiang,

763
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,790
Chief Editor Yu,

764
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,510
Ah Xiang, Suo Heng

765
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,980
and Ghost.

766
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,180
What about you?

767
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,270
You care about your writers too.

768
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,030
I don't believe that

769
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,070
they are nothing but
a part of the job for you.

770
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,430
If the second section
is really going down,

771
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,790
Moonlight Magazine is doomed.

772
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,110
Have you ever thought about

773
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,390
what's going to happen to your writers?

774
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,830
I...

775
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,510
You're not helping us.

776
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,110
You're helping yourself

777
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,990
and your writers.

778
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,710
Could you please tell me

779
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,070
what Miao

780
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,470
said to those missing writers?

781
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,430
Chief Editor Yu,

782
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,630
I know what's going on.

783
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,430
Is that so?

784
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,780
I'd like to know

785
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,150
what's going on as well.

786
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,430
Mr Liang,

787
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,990
you've come to
the editorial department again.

788
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,390
You think this is Disneyland?

789
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,550
You think I want to be here?

790
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,470
If I don't show up,

791
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,590
the second section

792
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,910
will be shut down soon.

793
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,510
Come to the meeting room now.

794
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,780
This is for you.

795
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,990
Put it down.

796
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,990
Thank you

797
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,310
for the interview.

798
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,420
I'm not only doing it for you,

799
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,740
I'm also doing it for myself.

800
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,790
I'm sorry

801
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,310
for getting you involved.

802
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,310
Although the rumour is
completely groundless

803
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,670
and I've set the record straight,

804
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,850
the public opinion

805
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,910
will not subside so quickly.

806
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,830
The best way

807
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,710
to deal with this

808
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,690
is to make a comparison
between the writing styles.

809
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,270
You can't

810
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,989
copy a writing style.

811
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,830
Words

812
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,270
have a mark of their own.

813
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,550
Believe it or not,

814
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,360
if I were to anonymously post
those pieces of junk you wrote

815
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,190
when you were young,

816
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,270
your loyal readers would still be able

817
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,510
to tell that it's your writing right away.

818
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,670
My writing style?

819
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,510
I

820
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,350
might have written something

821
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,550
that's related to the Book of Luo He God

822
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,590
in my high school exam paper.

823
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,790
But it was so long ago

824
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,520
that I forgot which year it was.

825
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,870
Hold on.

826
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,150
Back then,

827
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,230
your teachers brought along these papers

828
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,670
when they came to

829
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,070
tell on you.

830
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,710
Perhaps you can find something here.

831
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,830
This is my old journal.

832
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,070
You're still keeping them

833
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,270
after all this time?

834
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,070
I forgot to throw them away.

835
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,180
I'll get rid of them once you're done.

836
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,310
They take up space.

837
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,990
Have you read my novel?

838
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,550
Why would you stay with me
and look for the clues?

839
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,870
Duh!

840
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,700
You think I have too much time

841
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,020
to waste on meaningless things for you?

842
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,950
These junks weren't up to your standards.

843
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,270
Indeed, there's still some room

844
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,470
for improvement in your writing skill.

845
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,790
Nonsense!

846
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,430
Xiao Niao,

847
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,150
are you telling the truth?

848
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,230
Miao and Xin Dun Books have offered

849
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,670
very good working conditions.

850
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,830
But the writers,

851
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,230
including my uncle,

852
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,670
hadn't made up their minds

853
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,870
to leave with Miao at that time.

854
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,710
They have been here for so long,

855
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,350
the pay is not

856
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,350
the only reason that made them stay.

857
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,910
You're saying that

858
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,030
they are disappointed

859
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,110
because we've disassociated ourselves

860
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,350
from Zhou Chuan in the statement?

861
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,390
Are they really that fragile?

862
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,470
Nobody will believe that.

863
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,910
Mr Liang,

864
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,500
is that our main concern now?

865
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,700
The facts lie before us.

866
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,590
Aside from these two factors,

867
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,270
I must also mention Mr Xia.

868
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,790
What's with Mr Xia?

869
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,990
Word's gotten around that Mr Xia

870
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,870
was hospitalized because of this issue.

871
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,990
Everyone has great respect for him.

872
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,350
In light of this incident,

873
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,410
they think that
Yuan Yue Publishing House has changed.

874
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,350
Besides, they got wind of the fact that

875
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,190
Mr Xia is going to retire

876
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,920
after the Huazhi Award is over.

877
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,070
There's nothing to keep them
at Yuan Yue anymore.

878
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,980
Which is why it's better for them
to go to Xin Dun Books.

879
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,990
These ungrateful punks.

880
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,790
We've been paying them for nothing.

881
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,910
That's not true.

882
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,460
Be it editors and authors

883
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,790
or authors and publishing house,

884
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,950
we have a symbiotic relationship.

885
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,470
You said we're the ones
who took care of them,

886
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,550
but they were supporting us
at the same time as well.

887
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,150
Right,

888
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,470
Xiao Niao,

889
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,710
you knew about this?

890
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,030
Why didn't you say anything?

891
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,350
What took you so long?

892
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,270
I...

893
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,990
What do you want her to do?

894
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,230
Should she cut ties with her uncle

895
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,190
just because she's our editor?

896
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,020
Mr Liang,

897
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,430
this is

898
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,890
the internal affairs of
the second section.

899
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,230
I'll decide

900
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,590
what to do next.

901
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,790
Go back and take charge

902
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,650
of your circulation department.

903
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,070
I think

904
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,860
your blood sugar has dropped.

905
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,430
All right,

906
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,550
I'll find a way

907
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,390
to convince Director Yang

908
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,560
to withdraw the statement.

909
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,830
Don't stare at me with
such open gratitude.

910
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,110
I don't want the second section

911
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,830
to be disbanded too.

912
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,510
I'm afraid that won't be enough.

913
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,750
Xiao Niao,

914
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,830
do me a favour.

915
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,660
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

916
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,180
Xiao Niao.

917
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,620
Xiao Niao,

918
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,510
I'll go with you.

919
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,750
Do you not trust me?

920
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,550
It's not about that.

921
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,780
Mr He Ma is first on the the list

922
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,840
of people whom I need to pay a visit to.

923
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,150
So many of them?

924
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,210
Are you going to visit them one by one?

925
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,870
I know where he is.

926
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,230
I'll take you there.

927
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,270
Okay.

928
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,350
Mr He Ma!

929
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,190
-Xiao Niao.
-Uncle.

930
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,430
You're...

931
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,070
Hello, I'm Chu Li.

932
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,600
I'm an editor
from Yuan Yue Publishing House.

933
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,070
Zhou Chuan's editor?

934
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,670
Yes.

935
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,310
Today, I'm here to...

936
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,390
No matter why you're here,

937
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,350
I'm not interested in it at all.

938
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,830
Xiao Niao,

939
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,030
why did you bring her with you?

940
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,470
I'm sorry, Uncle.

941
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,670
But if there's a next time,

942
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,270
I'd still do it.

943
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,630
Mr He Ma,

944
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,390
I know you have many complaints

945
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,350
about Yuan Yue Publishing House right now.

946
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,470
But you've been working with

947
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,790
Yuan Yue Publishing House
for so many years.

948
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,790
Please give me 10 minutes.

949
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,990
-Uncle.
-Mr He Ma.

950
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,030
If possible,

951
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,230
could you please stop by
Yuan Yue tomorrow?

952
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,390
We will definitely give you

953
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,180
an answer.

954
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,430
What answer?

955
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,750
Does Yuan Yue still have any respect

956
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,310
for the senior writers

957
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,830
like us?

958
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,390
I know. Times have changed.

959
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,120
People aren't interested in
my writing anymore.

960
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,140
We've been working hard

961
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,110
on our books for so many years,

962
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,810
yet we're no better than some fresh meat.

963
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,590
Fresh meat?

964
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,710
Are you talking about Zhou Chuan?

965
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,040
I don't care what the other writers think.

966
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,550
But Yuan Yue Publishing House isn't

967
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,270
the same Yuan Yue Publishing House
it used to be.

968
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,420
Those anime or harem novels...

969
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,470
I don't understand

970
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,670
what the young generation like now.

971
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,590
I'm glad I'm leaving now.

972
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,750
I can make space for them.

973
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,830
Mr He Ma,

974
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,900
I've heard that

975
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,220
when you first published

976
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,830
your fantasy novel on Moonlight,

977
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,990
many people thought
it was a novel idea too.

978
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,430
But look, so many readers

979
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,550
gained a desire

980
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,460
to explore the unknown

981
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,350
and discover new worlds

982
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,070
because of your writing.

983
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,070
It doesn't matter if
Moonlight Magazine is reformatted.

984
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,030
What's important

985
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,030
is that your work is touching

986
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,310
and time won't change it.

987
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,190
There will always be young people
who like your work.

988
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,860
You really have a way with words.

989
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,190
I was speaking from my heart.

990
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,550
Moonlight needs a writer like you.

991
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,950
Or else, I wouldn't be
standing here today.

992
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,870
Alright,

993
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,750
let me ask you,

994
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,630
why wasn't my book

995
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,300
nominated for the Huazhi Award?

996
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,360
Why was Zhou Chuan's book nominated?

997
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,700
Sir,

998
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,350
what's the purpose

999
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,030
of you writing?

1000
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,190
What do you mean?

1001
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,150
If you're frustrated because

1002
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,910
Zhou Chuan was nominated

1003
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,430
and you're not,

1004
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,990
nothing I can say

1005
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,550
will make you stay.

1006
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,110
But if you're writing for yourself
or the readers,

1007
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,670
I can give you a million reasons
to make you stay.

1008
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,580
Xiao Niao, thanks for bringing me here.

1009
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,430
I'll do it on my own now.

1010
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,660
I'll go with you.

1011
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,550
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it
for Yuan Yue Publishing House.

1012
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,410
My writers need to
make a living with their writing.

1013
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,870
Okay.

1014
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,900
Let's visit Mr Nian Nian together.

1015
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,190
We're rejected by so many writers.

1016
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,030
It's okay, let's keep moving.

1017
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,150
Next, Mr Song Fei Ran.

1018
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,950
Sir, Pudong, please.

1019
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,230
Okay.

1020
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,150
[Great boast.]

1021
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,710
[I fell for it when I heard it.]

1022
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:29,340
[Afternoon Reading]

1023
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,790
[But in fact, he didn't
provide any evidence.]

1024
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,310
[In conclusion, I didn't do it.
I have the evidence.]

1025
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,310
[But I'm not the witness.]

1026
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,370
[And I don't have the real evidence.]

1027
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,990
[It's happening.]

1028
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,150
[The dad is trying to whitewash his son.]

1029
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,910
[Can't they just sit still
and let others mock them?]

1030
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,590
[They are a family after all.]

1031
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,030
[It's the dad's turn now.]

1032
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,830
[Too bad, we have sharp eyes.]
