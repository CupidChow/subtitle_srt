Director Li.

7
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,060
I know other popular writers

9
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,220
who are highly cooperative.

10
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,579
Maybe we can have a meal together.

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,460
Director Li.

12
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,340
Director Li.

13
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,060
Are you okay by yourself?

14
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,060
Thanks.

15
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,060
If this is not important,

16
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,420
I suggest that you leave.

17
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,650
It is.

18
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,370
She wanted me to delete something,
but I said no.

19
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,930
I won't delete the 100 thousand words

20
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,340
just because she said so.

21
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,860
A hundred thousand, mind you.

22
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,820
It's almost like a novella.

23
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,300
Yet she said

24
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,460
it will sell well
after the content is cut down.

25
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,140
As if it won't if nothing is deleted.

26
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,700
Was she being sarcastic?

27
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,260
No.

28
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,580
The thing is,

29
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,900
I got mad

30
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,420
and deleted monkey's QQ number.

31
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,659
But then I realised

32
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,260
that deleting some content

33
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,590
seems to really make it more interesting.

34
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,140
So, I was thinking

35
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,340
maybe I should show some mercy

36
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,420
and delete some.

37
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,500
Maybe that will work.

38
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,060
I'm doing this for my own sake.

39
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,900
So,

40
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,860
you regret deleting her?

41
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,460
Regret?

42
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,580
No way I would.

43
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,620
The person

44
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,660
who can make me feel that

45
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,380
is yet to be born.

46
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
Amazing.

47
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,820
But

48
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,530
I have

49
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,380
gone

50
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,220
a little overboard, haven't I?

51
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,260
You

52
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,900
should thicken your skin
and add her again.

53
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,220
She doesn't know
you're Zhou Chuan after all.

54
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,930
You're still a hero in her heart.

55
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,420
You're right.

56
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,140
Since you have put effort to comfort me,

57
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,860
I will add her back.

58
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,300
But I did this for you.

59
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,340

[Didn't you hear that?
He wanted me to use others' idea.]

[You can talk it over.]

68
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,360
[Leaving just like that
is too disrespectful.]

[Carry on?]

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,340

100
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,820
Isn't that like doubting a writer?

101
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,340
Who is that director?

102
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,020
What is his work?

103
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,700
Tell me.

104
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,500
I'll give him one star at Douban.

105
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620

106
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,700

Otherwise,

108
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,900
I'd really keep a distance

109
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,340
from you.

110
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,480
Is that true?

111
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,140
Yeah.

112
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,130
As a creator,

113
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,880
it is okay to write anything poorly.

114
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,500
But plagiarism is definitely a no.

115
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,020
What's more disgusting than plagiarism
is borrowing other's idea.

116
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
Asking me to use other's idea

117
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,260
is like doubting my capabilities.

118
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,179
If that director is in front of me,

119
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,020
I will...

120
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,380
I certainly will throw a beer can at him.

121
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,220
Even if that means your works

122
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,820
will never be made into film?

123
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,020
I write novels.

124
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,020
Whether they're made into films
doesn't matter to me.

125
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,420
Makes sense.

126
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,060
Disgusting.

127
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,700
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

128
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,500
I caught a cold.

129
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,060
Again?

130
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,300
[I gave Miao my umbrella the other day]

131
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
[and walked in the rain.]

132
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,940
Mr Zhou,

133
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,000
the cold sure takes quite some time
to catch up with you.

134
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,780
Shut up.

135
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,900
[Remember to drink more warm water then.]

136
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,360
And don't take medicine
with empty stomach.

137
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,540
The only thing left in my fridge
is the beef

138
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,100
you used to make porridge.

139
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,860
You can call for delivery.

140
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,530
Don't you know that?

141
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,100
Fine.

142
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,300
I lent my umbrella out.

143
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,690
I asked for this.

144
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,340
Hold on.

145
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,780
It's just porridge.

146
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,620
I'll make it.

147
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,880
When will you get here?

148
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,140
I'm starving.

149
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,820
In an hour.

150
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,930
It is peak hour now.

151
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,660
The bus is too packed.

152
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,010
You're taking bus?

153
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,330
Aren't you driving?

154
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,760
Take a taxi then.

155
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,820
Taxi?

156
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,940
I'm only paid 3,800 yuan after probation.

157
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,900
It's not US dollar.

158
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,010
Hello.

159
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,020
What did he mean by that?

160
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Get in.

161
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,140
Mr Zhou Chuan.

162
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,940
I can tell that you are really hungry.

163
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
You must be starving.

164
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,020
I'll make dinner right away.

165
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,780
Can it understand you?

166
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,210
I was talking to you.

167
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,650
Why weren't you looking at me?

168
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,340
The porridge will be ready soon.

169
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,580
But I'm leaving after that.

170
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,380
I still need to edit the remaining quarter

171
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,290
of Book of Luo He.

172
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,340
It is due tomorrow morning.

173
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,380
3,800 yuan every month,

174
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,890
without overtime pay.

175
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,880
I'm surprised you didn't burn
Yuan Yue down.

176
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
I guess I don't want to go to jail.

177
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,860
Mr Zhou,

178
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,300
do you have anything else to say?

179
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,780
No.

180
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,410
But I think

181
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,460
that we don't have to

182
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,660
fight every time.

183
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,220
We can get along peacefully too.

184
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,140
So?

185
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,260
So, I feel quite awkward.

186
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
That's why I want us to keep talking.

187
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,380
Mr Zhou,

188
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,700
I'm in a rush to make your dinner,

189
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,970

But a young lady's cooking

219
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,740

who you share a room with?

00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,300
As an editor,

376
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,900
I, too,

377
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,940
can't persuade my writer
to borrow other's ideas.

378
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,140
"She cracked a smile
on her icy face and said,"

379
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
Isn't this contradicting?

380
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,780
Which one should I delete?

381
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,300
The icy face part.

382
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,820
Won't you read it first?

383
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,780
That's my own story.

384
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,340
Of course I remember.

385
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,850
Then tell me who is being described?

386
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,540
The main character.

387
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,340
It's the supporting character.

388
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,900
Here's another problem.

389
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,540
As the main character
got out from the mud,

390
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,700
he suddenly showed up
in front of everyone

391
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,780
like a deity?

392
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,940
Something is not right here.

393
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,460
What is?

394
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,530
From the part where
he got out from the mud

395
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,330
until he had a long fight
in front of others.

396
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,780
People were actually calling him

397
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,700
a handsome gentleman?

398
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Isn't this too...

399
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,610
What about this?

400
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,610
♫ I want to hide like a kid
who made mistakes ♫

401
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,950
♫ My heart skipped a beat ♫

402
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,830

♫ You don't seem to be surprised ♫

♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

♫ What can I tell myself ♫

431
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,580
Shoot.

432
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,660
Why did I fall asleep?

433
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,090
Where's the draft?

434
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,100
Stop yelling so early in the morning.

435
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,260
It's already 7.30 am, Mr Zhou Chuan.

436
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,610
This is a working day,

437
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,940
which does not exist
in a jobless man's book.

438
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,620
I'll freshen up and make you breakfast.

439
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,280
You can have it when you get up.

440
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,700
Anyway, thanks.

441
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,340
For finishing the rest of it for me.

442
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,620
And giving me the blanket.

443
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,620
I should have carried you to the bed.

444
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,140
And tuck you in.

445
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,820
You... you don't have to do that.

446
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,970
But you're too heavy for that.

447
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,260
Chief Editor Yu.

448
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,820
I have done editing Mr Zhou Chuan's draft.

449
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,380
Please take a look.

450
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,500
You're only handing it in now?

451
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,900
Xiao Niao already handed hers in

452
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,140
a long time ago.

453
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,340
That is Mr Zhou Chuan's book, after all.

454
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,570
Since it's important,

455
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,220
it's normal to do it slowly.

456
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,300
Okay.

457
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,700
Xiao Niao. Chu Li.

458
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,020
Since the first drafts have been edited,

459
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,940
Miao, Mr Xia and I

460
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,260
will take care

461
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,660
of the rest.

462
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,050
Now you can start working on

463
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,970
the new Moonlight instalment.

464
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:56,940
Okay, Chief Editor.

465
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,600
Just let me know if you need me.

466
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,420
For this issue,

467
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,140
Mr Xia wants to hold an event on preamble.

468
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,420
The theme is "Playfulness".

469
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,460
Please find two or three writers

470
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,540
to deliver their articles by next week.

471
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,290
Got it.

472
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,540
Ah Xiang.

473
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,620
Why did you bring me here?

474
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,140
Chu Li, tell me.

475
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,980
Can you find a writer

476
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
for the First Volume Project?

477
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,660
I have Mr Zhou Chuan, don't I?

478
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,820
No, it's different.

479
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,570
The First Volume Project
is a mate's creation.

480
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,610
They aren't exactly paid.

481
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,100
But it's not that they're unpaid.

482
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,700
Well, it's 80 yuan for every 1,000 words.

483
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,340
80 yuan? That is too little.

484
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,460
They might as well do it for free.

485
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,820
If Mr Zhou Chuan learns that,

486
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,100
he'll definitely say

487
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,940
that such insulting pay

488
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,540
is lesser than a beggar's money.

489
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,450
Chu Li, How many writers

490
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,460
of Yuan Yue Publishing House do you know?

491
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,140
The only one I really know

492
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,820
is Mr Zhou Chuan.

493
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,650
In my opinion,

494
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,620
you can call Mr Zhou Chuan first.

495
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,540
He's a nice guy.

496
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,570
I'm sure he will help.

497
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,060
Helping a friend?

498
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,620
Do you think I'm a beggar?

499
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,340
No.

00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,410
So,

558
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,900
my long time fan is your internet friend,

559
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,380
as well as your editor?

560
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,300
Yeah.

561
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,020
Chu Li that frequents the bookstore?

562
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Yeah.

563
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,500
Such a small world, isn't it?

564
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,340
You kept showing off to me,

565
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,020
saying that the lady from the
editorial department cooks for you.

566
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,180
Turns out

567
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,250
she knows you

568
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,540
because of me.

569
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,410
And it's because of me

570
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,740
that she joined Yuan Yue.

571
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,730
Also because of me,

572
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,900
she joined the publishing industry.

573
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,100
Jiang Yu Cheng.

574
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,420
You sure are

575
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,540
a way better narcissist than I am.

576
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,660
When I see her,

577
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,820
I'm going to tell her

578
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,420
that some fellow is her internet friend.

579
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
I'll have to cut off our brotherhood then.

580
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,380
Say it already. Will you help or not?

581
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,780
Did Mr Jiang Yu Cheng send this?

582
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,620
He sent the article

583
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,050
within half an hour.

584
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,470
As expected from Jiang Yu Chen
that was once a top writer.

585
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,410
He wrote a complete flash fiction

586
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,620
using just 1,000 words

587
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,300
in such a short period of time.

588
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,700
The plot was nicely written.

589
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,660
Incredible.

590
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,850
Mr Jiang will never run out of idea.

591
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,820
A writer who once hit the bottom,

592
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,020
yet his writing skills have improved.

593
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,420
Amazing.

596
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,020
He's different from the average writers.

597
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,140
Some writers,

598
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,290
although persevere,

599
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,490
still couldn't find a way out.

What about Nian Nian and Mr He Ma?

605
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,300
Should they share a page?

606
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,940
No way.

607
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,820
It's Mr He Ma, mind you.

608
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,100
He can't share a page with someone else.

610

You're a senior editor.

611
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,860
Can't you tell the difference in quality

612
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,060
of these articles?

613
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,860
That's it.

Well, you know him.

619
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,250
Always the strict editor as he is.

620
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,889
I guess the Editor Group will be chaotic.

621
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,340
You two, consider this

622
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,020

the editors' faults again?

629

631

This part is not comprehensible.

632
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,530
This part is contradictory.

633
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,690
There is a general mistake here.

634
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,650
Isn't this public shaming?

635
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,780
But all of these

636
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,580
seem to be criticizing Xiao Niao,

-What brings you here, Mr Xia?
-Hi, Mr Xia.

Don't get excited yet.

Mr Xia.

649
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,170
Is something wrong with the draft

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,850
of Book of Luo He?

651
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,660
I haven't finished it.

652
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,210
But as a rookie,

653
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,260
you did a really good job.

654
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,170
One should work very hard since young

to gain knowledge.

656
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,770

Keep it up. But,

Okay.

Then, Mr Xia,

why do you want to see me?

662
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,090

to do me a favour.

664
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,450
Mr Xia, these are...

665
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,300
These are the articles I handled

666
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,260
at Yuan Yue all these years.

667
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,100
You kept them?

668
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,690
Our tradition here at Yuan Yue

669
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,890
is to return the articles

670
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,210
to the writers.

671
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,780
But we will surely keep the copies.

672
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,210
The oldest ones
must have dated back 30 years ago.

673
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,620
Thirty years? They're older than me.

674
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,860
That's why I want you
to help me count them.

675
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,700
See if we can

676
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,820
take a photo of them

677
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,700
and save them in the computer

678
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,730
so we don't have to
worry about losing them.

679
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,610
The best thing about being an editor

680
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,020
is to watch the seedling I nurtured

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,250
Stop pointing.

746
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,690
Where's your manners?

747
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,020
Where have you been?

748
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,620
Mr Zhou Chuan, what brings you here?

749
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,530
I'm going out of town.

750
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,860
I came to check on the progress
for Book of Luo He before that.

751
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,220
I'm going out with Jiang Yu Cheng,

752
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,220
the has-been.

753
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,430
Don't you dare say that about Mr Jiang.

754
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,900
Don't I dare what?

755
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,500
Say again?

756
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,500
The Book of Luo He has been reviewed.

757
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,460
We can start designing the cover now.

758
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,740
Don't worry.

759
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,860
You know how to change topic now?

760
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,540
No.

761
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,250
Ah Xiang, come here.

762
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,380
Hurry.

763
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,650
Mr Zhou Chuan, let me introduce.

764
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,530
This is Ah Xiang, our art director.

765
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,620
She's also in charge of

766
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,380
the page design of the Book of Luo He.

767
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,420
Just tell her

768
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,690
the style you would like.

769
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,940
Hi, Mr Zhou Chuan.

770
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,700
I want

771
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,430
a fashionable look
with refreshing traditional style.

772
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,660
I don't think refreshing and fashionable

773
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,980
go together.

774
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,060
No?

775
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,980
Yes. I'm fine with anything.

776
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Okay. I trust you.

777
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,260
One moment please, Mr Zhou Chuan.

778
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,420
Bye, Mr Zhou Chuan.

779
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,480
Where are we going?

780
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,060
Bye, Mr Zhou Chuan.

781
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
This is the library. Take a look.

782
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,340
I'm leaving for one week.

783
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,620
Look here.

784
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,740
Aren't you worried about me at all?

785
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,340
You're with Mr Jiang Yu Cheng, aren't you?

786
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
I'm sure he can resolve

787
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,000
all the troubles you created.

788
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,010
Say again?

789
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,500
Come on. Let's pick a cover.

790
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,980
[Books on Editing]

791
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,270
[Listen to The Rain]

792
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,020
Listen to The Rain?
A Republic of China era spy theme book.

793
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,860
It's so different

794
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,900
from your oriental imagination.

795
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,900
Douglas' Night Diary?

796
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,890
A western classic documentary writing.

797
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,020
It's also not in any bit

798
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,290
similar to your oriental imagination.

799
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:49,340
Sunset on The Battlefield?
The military theme.

800
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,060
All the more different...

801
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,060
Mr Zhou Chuan, I'm begging you.

802
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,660
Please take this seriously.

803
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,740
Don't pick randomly.

804
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,700
If you search further,

805
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,560
you'll even find the dictionary.

806
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,990
Is the cover important?

807
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,940
What matters is the content.

808
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,140
Isn't the cover important?

809
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,700
How about this?

810
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,660
I'll get someone

811
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,130
to draw two adorable animals.

812
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,620
And we'll use

813
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,020
cute colourful jelly fonts.

814
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,740
As for the style, let's try Boonie Bears.
How about that?

815
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,100
Don't you dare.

816
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,700
What is it? You despise Boonie Bears?

817
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,500
It's very popular among the kids.

818
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,300
Kids below three are crazy over it.

819
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,500
Everyone watches it.

820
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,980
I've read your magazine.

821
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,700
The highlight of First Volume Project

822
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,130
was Jiang Yu Cheng's work, wasn't it?
