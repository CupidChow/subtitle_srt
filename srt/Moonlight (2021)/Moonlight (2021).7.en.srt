00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,970
[Moonlight]

3
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,700
If you want to talk me into
using Cocoon's service,

5
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,070
I suggest you to hang up now.

6
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,390
Let's not waste each other's time.

7
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,390
[Wait, listen to me, sir.]

8
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,390
[During the regular meeting,
Mr Xia kept saying]

9
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,560
that we must find Book of Luo He God

10
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,009
an illustrator
who is good at mediaeval art

11
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,160
and who is as reputable as you.

12
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,500
Except for Cocoon, anyone will do.

13
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,430
But there are only three illustrators
who meet these criteria.

14
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,320
Yes.

15
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,900
[One of them is a game concept artist]

16
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,150
[who only accepts reservations
six months in advance.]

17
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,540
There's not enough time for sure.

18
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,470
Another one is a movie poster artist.

19
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,870
There's no way our
publishing house can afford it.

20
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,930
Cocoon is our last option.

21
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,660
There's no room for negotiation.

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,860
Sir, don't be mad.

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,700
Wait.

24
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,940
Excuse me, Mr Zhou Chuan.

25
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,430
Give me a minute.

26
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,870
What? I can't wait for you.

27
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,910
Chu Li, Xiao Niao is on
a sick leave this afternoon.

28
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,550
But she called and said that
she forgot to sign an invoice.

29
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,350
She wants you to do so on her behalf.

30
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,470
Do you know the character
and reputation of Cocoon?

31
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,670
I learned that, when she's still a nobody,

32
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,540
a talented writer
wrote for her illustrations.

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,710
That's how she became famous.

34
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,030
But when she became well-known,

35
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,230
she turned against that writer
and denied their collaboration.

36
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,350
Why would you work with
this kind of person?

37
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,310
This is the merchandise figure for Hua Li.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,390
Hand it to the Marketing Department now.

39
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,470
She said she's gone through it.

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,230
And Miao has signed it.

41
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,110
You just have to sign it on her behalf.

42
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,670
Forget it. Where's my pen?

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,870
[Person In Charge: Miao Qing Ping]
[Handler: Chu Li]

44
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,420
If Book of Luo He God becomes
a flop because of Cocoon,

45
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,370
it will be merely
a failure in your career.

46
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,350
You can pull yourself up.

47
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,870
And go on selling Jiang Yu Cheng's
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

48
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,870
What about me?

49
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,600
Who should I go to?

50
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,260
Thanks.

51
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,620
Hello, sir. Are you still there?

52
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,550
[Let's continue.]

53
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,910
[We advise you to hire
Madam Cocoon as your illustrator.]

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,370
[Because our publishing house
finds her the best option.]

55
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,000
Weren't you listening to me?

56
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,550
There's an urgent invoice
that needed my signature.

57
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,590
Didn't I ask you to give me a minute?

58
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,150
Where were we when you went away?

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,079
Didn't I ask you to wait for me?

60
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,740
What have I done to make him mad again?

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,200
♫ They say strange things

62
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,180

The coupons.

78
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,140
The mall beside is
having a promotion today.

79
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,470
A penny saved is a penny earned.

80
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,830
Don't tell others that I was here.

81
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,060
Why are you afraid of being found out?

82
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,950
You just came to work.
And now you're leaving?

83
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,950
The obscure Sis Xian Yu.

84
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,600
Deputy Editor Miao.

85
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,230
Here's the manuscript for
the next instalment

86
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,440
of The Disappearing Amusement Park.

87
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,480
I already confirmed it
with Mr Jiang yesterday.

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,020
Well, just place it here.

89
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,720
All of you, get over here.
We need to talk.

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,190
What's the matter?

91
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,830
"What's the matter?"

92
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,910
Du Niao Niao, tell us what happened.

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,870
There's some problem with
the merchandise figure for Hua Li.

94
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,550
Is it "some" problem?

95
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,770
Our department

96
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,270
decided on four thousand
metal bookmarks as Hua Li merchandise.

97
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,790
Why did you submit an invoice
of twelve thousand copies?

98
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,110
The first print run for this book is
twelve thousand copies only.

99
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,310
Could the Marketing Department
have made a mistake?

100
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,590
And you.

101
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,830
Both of your signatures are on it.
Take a look by yourself.

102
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,670
There are eight thousand extra copies.

103
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,550
What should we do about the cost of them?

104
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,100
Are we going to pay it with
your salary? Or yours?

105
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,870
How did you verify it?

106
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm sorry, Chief Editor Yu.

107
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,470
I was on a half-day leave.

108
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,480
Chu Li is not to blame for it.
Please don't blame her.

109
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,030
I was on the phone with Mr Zhou Chuan.

110
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,750
And I put him on hold.

111
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,740
I saw Deputy Editor Miao's
signature on it.

112
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,190
That's why I didn't think twice.

113
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,590
What are you saying?

114
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,390
Wait.

115
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,460
You didn't do your work well.

116
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,750
Why are you blaming me for it?

117
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,110
You're being unprofessional. Got it?

118
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,550
How many times have I reminded you
about the merchandise figure?

119
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,480
It can't be more than
one third of the first print run.

120
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,190
Do I have to teach you that?

121
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,710
Do you want me to feed you?

122
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,520
What's wrong with you?

123
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,930
Enough, cut it out.

124
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,560
You guys are passing the buck.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Is it what you do when problems arise?

126
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,190
Everyone in the second section
is responsible for it.

127
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,270
Every one of us

128
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,070
will be given a pay cut as punishment.

129
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,270
A fine?

130
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,790
Is there any problem?

131
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,990
Miao and I will each pay
five thousand yuan.

132
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,830
One thousand yuan from each newbie.

133
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,600
Sis Xian Yu will pay three thousand yuan.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,390
Three...

135
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,940
I'll give you a pay cut for this.

136
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,380
If you ever make the same mistake again,

137
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,750
it will be more than a salary cut.

138
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,710
Do you hear me?

139
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,159
Chief Editor Yu.

140
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,710
Can I pay in instalments?

141
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,990
My monthly salary is 3,800 yuan.

142
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,990
Minus 1,000, there're 2,800 left.

143
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,350
The rent is 4,500 yuan for three months.

144
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,150
Minus the money for
transportation and food...

145
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,940
-500?!

146
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,270
My God!

147
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,390
I've been working so hard
for the past month.

148
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,630
And I still end up owing
the society 500 yuan.

149
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,440
Madam Landlord, why are you here?

150
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,260
Girl.

151
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,750
What's happened to this fridge?
It won't stay closed.

152
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,910
It's always been like this.

153
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,780
When you first moved in here,

154
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,270
I bought all these new stuff, you know.

155
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,350
You'd end up breaking
all these good stuffs.

156
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Forget about it. You're a girl after all.

157
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,870
I'll take the high road.

158
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,560
Madam.

159
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,870
What are you actually here for?

160
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,350
Here's the thing.

161
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,590
My son is getting married soon.

162
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,640
I want to make this room
his wedding chamber.

163
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
That's why I came to ask you

164
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,120
if you can move out this month.

165
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,870
Move out?

166
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,470
Where to?

167
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,630
But if you have no place to live,

168
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,650
you can stay here for
another month or two.

169
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,930
It's negotiable.

170
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,050
Sure, how do we settle it?

171
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,260
Pay extra 500 yuan
for the next month's rent,

172
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,110
and I'll let you stay for another month.

173
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,180
Five hundred?!

174
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,680
You want to charge me extra
500 yuan for this awful room?

175
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,660
What kind of attitude is this?

176
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,330
I'm not attending to my son's wedding.

177
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,550
Because I care about your well-being.

178
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,870
If you don't want to stay here,
just move out.

179
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,580
I'll ask someone to clean this room up.

180
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
But if you refuse to move out,

181
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,850
I won't return you
the deposit for this month.

182
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,140
You...

183
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,410
I thought of living on
water for this month.

184
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,630
I guess the air is my only option now.

185
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
My darling daughter.

186
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,820
Hi, Dad.

187
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,320
It's been some time since your called us.

188
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,550
Our chestnuts are on the market now.

189
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,030
Your mum ordered me

190
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,870
to send you ten catties of chestnuts.

191
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,840
I didn't order you to do so.

192
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,020
[Suit yourself and post them to her.]

193
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,660
I'm watching the telly.

194
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,190
Why are you talking
on the phone here? Get out.

195
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,400
Daughter.

196
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,130
You called at the right time.

197
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,300
I've spend a lot time counselling
and educating your mum.

198
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,900
And now she's more
accepting of your action.

199
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,450
What a good new that is.

200
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,380
[But here's a bad news.]

201
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,750
Your mum took away
all of my little coffers.

202
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,700
She's confiscated them.

203
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,830
She even made me write
a 3,000-word self-critique.

204
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,150
[Aren't I living a hard life?]

205
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,430
It's okay, Dad.

206
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,150
I'll make a lot of money,

207
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,870
and give it all to you.

208
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,870
You can save it as your secret nest egg.

209
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,310
You're really a good girl.

210
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,390
You're doing quite well, aren't you?

211
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,690
Are you in some trouble?

212
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,790
Not at all. I'm doing pretty well.

213
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,200
I'm not in any trouble.

214
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,510
It's just that I've been away
from home for long.

215
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,190
And I've missed you.

216
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,480
I miss you, too.

217
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,310
Are you really okay?

218
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,750
I'm all right. Don't worry.

219
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,480
Also,

220
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,990
tell Her Highness

221
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,990
that I'll definitely work hard.

222
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,270
Sure.

223
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,070
I'm hanging up then.

224
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,990
Rest well. Bye-bye.

225
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,310
Our daughter

226
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,270
is probably in some trouble.

227
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,250
Did she ask you for money?

228
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,560
No.

229
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,160
We know her well.

230
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,310
She's probably in a trouble.

231
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,150
Hurry up and give me the money!

232
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,710
I'll wire her some money!

233
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,310
Why are you shouting?

234
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,840
I've said not to give her money.

235
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,310
What are you doing?

236
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,760
Our child is all alone and
far away from home.

237
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,390
Her family isn't there.

238
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,320
And she doesn't know anyone there.

239
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,660
You're her mother after all.

240
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,630
How can you be so stone-hearted?

241
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,390
What do you mean?

242
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,220
Why are you shouting?

243
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,110
Are you the only one who cares about her?

244
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,700
Can you think about it?

245
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,310
You can't just wire her money
whenever she's in some trouble.

246
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,550
Have you ever thought about it?

247
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,710
If you keep doing so,

248
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,590
when will she come home?

249
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,630
If she still cares about us
and this family,

250
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,090
she will come home eventually.

251
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,050
If she decides not to come home,

252
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,710
I'll accept it.

253
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,150
She can strive to make
a name for herself, then.

254
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,980
Yes.

255
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,830
You're right.

256
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,630
Why don't you give me some money first?

257
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,110
I'll wire it to her.

258
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,930
[Rental Details]

259
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,270
[Have you found an illustrator
for Book of Luo Shen God?]

260
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,550
[Yu Tao]

261
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,230
[I'm still looking for one.]

262
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,630
[I'll contact Mr Zhou Chuan immediately.]

263
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,880
Hello.

264
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,030
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

265
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,050
We'll talk about the illustrator tomorrow.
I'm busy now.

266
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,030
Mr Zhou Chuan, we can wait no more.

267
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,270
Chief Editor Yu made it clear

268
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,670
that the Book of Luo Shen God must
be displayed in this year's book fair.

269
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,910
And we're one week behind schedule.

270
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,390
We must decide on the illustrator today.

271
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,950
Please, sir.

272
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,160
Stand in our editors' shoes.

273
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,140
I'm doing all this for
the publication of your book.

274
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,220
Why are you all behaving like this?

275
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,950
Can't you put some effort into it?

276
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,990
Hello!

277
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,390
Are you done talking?

278
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,870
I'm at hospital.

279
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,660
You can talk to me face-to-face.

280
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,540
Hospital?

281
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,830
Why are you at the hospital?

282
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,750
Which hospital?

283
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,310
I'll be right there.

284
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,030
Sir.

285
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,980
I want to go to No. 1412
of South Lingyan Road.

286
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,860
About how much does it cost?

287
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,460
It's far from here.
It's between 80 to 100 yuan.

288
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,870
-Drive faster, thank you.
-Sure.

289
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,790
Go.

290
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,470
Hello. I'm sorry, Mr Jiang.

291
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,300
I'm afraid we can't meet to
talk about the manuscript today.

292
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,110
Why do you sound so tired?

293
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,650
You didn't sleep well?

294
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,630
All right, I'll leave you to it.

295
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,550
We can meet next time.

296
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,980
Sure. Thank you, Mr Jiang.

297
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,770
Sir, please go faster.

298
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,640
Hi.

299
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,510
Hi.

300
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,350
May I know if I can buy the scented
candles in the shop window?

301
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,950
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,790
The candles are the free gifts
with purchase of high heels.

303
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,230
It's on me.

304
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,090
No need.

305
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,170
Why did you give Chu Li the bookmark?

306
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,070
Are you free?

307
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,670
Mr Zhou Chuan.

308
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,990
Is Er Gou all right?

309
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,190
Do you care about it so much?

310
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,760
You're wearing the shoes
on the wrong feet.

311
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,819
♫ I want to hide like a kid
who made mistakes ♫

312
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,740
I thought something happened to you.

313
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,390
That's why I rushed here.

314
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,230
♫ My heart skipped a beat ♫

315
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,550
I didn't realise you sent me
an address to an animal Hospital.

316
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,849
Er Gou got into a fight
with a German Shepherd.

317
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,060
♫ When you look at me
everything seems so cute ♫

318
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,030
But it's all right.

319
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,630
It's still alive.

320
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,990
♫ I am the only one feeling strange ♫

321
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,500
Then did it win the fight?

322
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,320
I was just asking,
since it's a fight between two dogs.

323
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,620
♫ I have got a million whys ♫

324
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,670
With this kind of mentality,

325
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,710
your future kid is definitely
a kindergarten bully.

326
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,150
♫ But I can't tell ♫

327
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,520
♫ I still have my sanity ♫

328
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,140
It ripped off half of
the German Shepard's ear

329
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,950
and won the fight.

330
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,820
Good job.

331
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,860
♫ I fled for a week ♫

332
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,080
The dog feed isn't for nothing.

333
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,410
♫ You don't seem to be surprised ♫

334
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,390
That's surprising.

335
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,940
It appears slow-witted.

336
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,190
But it goes wild at a critical moment.

337
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,970
♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

338
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,430
Oh, right. Have you had your breakfast?

339
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,510
-Let me get you something to eat.
-Sit down.

340
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,760
♫ I have told you a thousand times ♫

341
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,060
Why did you want to see me?

342
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,310
I don't believe an illustrator

343
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,760
would make you go berserk like this.

344
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,990
♫ The world is on
the verge of elimination ♫

345
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
I haven't even started talking.

346
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,710
And you're acting like a dog
whose tail gets stepped on.

347
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,080
♫ Only you are still favoured by me ♫

348
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,010
Don't even bring that up.

349
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
There's some error
with the merchandise figure.

350
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,710
Every one of us who's
dealing with the contract

351
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,790
♫ I've got a million whys ♫

352
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,520
was given an earful

353
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,870
and a pay cut.

354
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,830
And it's not a small amount.

355
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,070
The worst part is

356
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,670
my landlord wants me to move out.

357
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,790
Now I don't even have a place to live.

358
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,990
Ask your family for help.

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,710
♫ Because when you look into my eyes ♫

360

They wouldn't refuse to
lend you a hand, would they?

361
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,350
Forget about it.

362
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,470
My dad's got a controlling wife.
His life is more miserable than mine.

363
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,130
♫ I have told you a thousand times ♫

364

And my mum hopes I can't hang on

365
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,460
so that I can pack up and head home soon.

366

♫ You don't have to guess ♫

367
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,900

♫ How much I depend on you ♫

369
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,810
I agree to it.

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,060
♫ Because when you hold me in your arms ♫

371
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,320

♫ I have never felt so right ♫

373

♫ If this is not love ♫

375

that you agree to use Cocoon's service?

Mr Zhou Chuan!

380
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,630
Thank you!

381
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,110
You're truly
the greatest writer in the world!

382
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,590
How about Jiang Yu Cheng?

383
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,910
Both of you are the greatest writers.

384
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,420
[Dad]

385
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,450
What are you looking at?

386
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,190
Hello, Dad.

387
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,520
[Hello.]

388
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,930
[Where are you?]

389
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,550
Hello, Dad. I'm outside.

390
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,510
[Did Er Gou get into
a fight with another dog?]

391
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,730
How did you know that?

392
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,830
Aren't you abusing it

393
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,490
by sending him to the pet shop?

394
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,720
What do you mean by "abusing it"?
Please mind your words.

395
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,670
I've been busy for the past two days.

396
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,110
That's why I left it to
the pet sitters at the shop.

397
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,110
And they took good care of it.

398
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,590
The canned foods were from the house.
And there's even an hour of...

399
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,450
Surprisingly, Mr Zhou Chuan
is not only rude to me.

400
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,590
He's as rude to his dad.

401
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Jiang Yu Cheng has got a big mouth indeed.

402
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,670
Didn't you call him

403
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,190
for something else?

404
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,740
Get to the point.

405
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,850
[Hello. Are you still listening?]

406
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
[Listen.]

407
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,280
There will be a meeting at
the Writers Association next week.

408
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,530
You and Xiao Jiang need to be there.

409
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,510
And bring Er Gou back here
for recuperation.

410
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,350
Why did you suddenly decide on it?

411
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,080
I've said that I don't want to
attend that meeting.

412
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,580
And now you want to take my dog away.

413
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,760
You're already an old man.
And you're taking your son's dog.

414
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,050
How shameful.

415
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,770
What are you saying?

416
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,070
I say I don't want to attend that meeting.

417
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,390
I'm doing this for your own sake.

418
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,400
Fine.

419
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,670
Bring Er Gou back here.
I'll take care of it.

420
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,990
Not only do you want me
to attend the meeting,

421
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,940
but also take away my dog.

422
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,750
Your negotiation skills
are unparalleled indeed.

423
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,590
[Er Gou can't even close its mouth.]

424
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,700
[How can I take it back there?]

425
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,270
If we were to deliver it,

426
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,670
what if it gets infected

427
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,510
or bumps into something?

428
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,300
What do you mean by
"it's as fragile as its owner"?

429
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,750
Let's drop it. You win.

430
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm hanging up!

431
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,230
Hello?

432
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,620
Here.

433
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,800
Thanks.

434
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,980
You weren't used to drinking this.

435
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,700
That's three years ago.

436
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,270
Three years ago, you would at least

437
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,390
make the best choice for yourself.

438
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,800
I seriously don't get it.

439
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,150
In terms of experience,
I'm more experienced than her.

440
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,230
In terms of condition,
Xin Dun Books is surely the better option.

441
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,690
In terms of relationship,

442
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,130
I think I won't hurt you.

443
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,340
Why did you choose her?

444
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,420
She's different from you.

445
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,100
At least she knows

446
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,990
how to respect others' hard work.

447
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,920
She knows how to appreciate words.

448
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,920
You're still blaming me.

449
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,840
I'm not blaming you.

450
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,330
I neither love

451
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,590
nor hate you.

452
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,350
And I don't miss you.

453
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,940
But as a writer,

454
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,050
I will never choose

455
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,070
an editor that betrayed me.

456
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,270
[Ai-Bi Pet Hospital]

457
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,450
I've also paid for the medical expenses
of that German Shepherd.

458
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,240
4,000-plus yuan?

459
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,510
What are you looking at?

460
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,170
Er Gou has gotten into the car.

461
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,130
I would love to get bitten by it.

462
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,740
You need not give me a lot of money.

463
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,970
I just need a few thousand yuan
for one month's rent.

464
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,870
That German Shepherd is a racing dog
with a pedigree certificate.

465
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,110
What do you have?

466
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,240
The birth certificate from
Second People's Hospital in Hangzhou.

467
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,990
Get in the car.

468
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,420
Dogs live better than humans.

469
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,290
Enter your house address for navigation.

470
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,910
Done.

471
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,370
Did Mr Zhou Gu Xuan call you just now?

472
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,170
He invited you to join the meeting
at Writers Association?

473
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,310
The meeting is an annual thing.

474
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,500
Why aren't you joining it?

475
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,880
It's really no fun.

476
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,690
If I join it,

477
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,590
everyone will ask me
if I'm single or taken.

478
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,860
And then they will start introducing

479
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,390
their nieces and granddaughters.

480
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,370
Does Writers Association act as
the matchmaker for single authors?

481
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,350
Why do I feel so tired talking to you?

482
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,800
Why do you seem so envious?

483
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,320
Not at all.

484
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,170
I got it.

485
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,500
You find it boring to make
small talk with those writers

486
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,990
because you don't have
common interest topics, right?

487
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,400
You're a human when your brain is working.

488
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,150
Yes, that's what I meant.

489
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,140
Actually, there are

490
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,230
many things to learn from
traditional literature.

491
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,650
An exciting and in-depth novel

492
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,550
makes an educational entertainment,
isn't it?

493
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,610
Be more open-minded, Mr Zhou Chuan.

494
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,750
Miao gives you a lecture every day.

495
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,150
But do you like it?

496
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,150
There are veteran writers that are
both noble and talented.

497
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,990
But there's another kind of people.

498
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,300
For example, Miao.

499
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
He doesn't want you to
become a good editor.

500
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
He just wants to tell everyone this.

501
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,820
"I've done my part."

502
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,020
"So don't call me unforgiving."

503
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,880
"He didn't learn well after all."

504
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,560
I got it.

505
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,320
Miao has always hated me.

506
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,480
He hopes I quit.

507
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,350
But I never make that an excuse
for not doing my job well

508
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,880
and leaving this large,
resourceful forest.

509
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,400
Since you're not able to assimilate
yourself perfectly into the food chain,

510
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,070
you must leave soonest to save your life.

511
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,710
Mr Zhou Chuan.

512
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,150
How could you say so?

513
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,630
Even Er Gou fought for its territory.

514
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,100
When you're in a new environment

515
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,890
and find out that
you can't assimilate into it,

516
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,230
you can't just turn around and leave.

517
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,470
You need to work harder

518
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,730
to become the top figure
in the new food chain.

519
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,760
Running away doesn't solve anything.

520
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,610
What a chatterbox.

521
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,810
Indeed.

522
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
All I ever do is preach.

523
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,470
I can't manage my little,
ordinary life well.

524
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,890
I should head home early

525
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,620
and find myself a living spot
under the bridge.

526
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,080
Safety belt.

527
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,020
Thanks.

528
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,970
This is it?

529
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,300
Yes.

530
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,950
You got worked up because you're
sad from losing a living place like this?

531
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,610
Isn't it better than

532
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,860
where the beggars gather?

533
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,110
I'm heading home, then.
Thank you for sending me home, sir.

534
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,710
Take good care of Er Gou.

535
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,950

714
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,770
Let's make it through this first.

715
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,630
I've arrived.

716
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,980
Why didn't you call a moving company?

717
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,290
That's too costly.

718
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,190
There's no way I could afford it.

719
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,220
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

720
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,949
You're such a nice person.

721
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,230
Save your thanks.

722
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
Memorise this.

723
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,389
Thirty Rules for the Tenant?

724
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,239
Thirty rules?

725
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,350
Do not take advantage of the circumstance

726
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,790
and commit bad deeds

727
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,989
against the landlord.

728
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,190
Bad deeds?

729
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,000
Like urging me to submit a manuscript.

730
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,670
And day and night, using whatever methods

731
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,030
to repeatedly demand the landlord to use

732
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,150
the service of the illustrator he hates.

733
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,910
Or force the landlord into signing

734
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,670
another publishing contract

735
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,060
that offers a pathetic minimum
number of printed copies.

736
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,700
What were you thinking?

737
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,190
It seems that you're
very much prejudiced against me.

738
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,290
You just found out about it?

739
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,420
But I'm

740
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,700
very sincere with you.

741
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,310
When I received your call yesterday,

742
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,390
I spent my last 100 yuan,

743
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,630
which was supposed to be

744
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,190
for my living expenses,

745
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,070
to hail a cab and see you.

746
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,110
Otherwise, you wouldn't

747
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,470
have shown up here.

748
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,710
Firmly protect
the landlord's personal privacy.

749
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,940
Do not post the landlord's private photos

750
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,910
on social media.

751
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,430
Do not threaten the landlord
with his naked pictures.

752
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,950
Naked pictures?!

753
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,750
You...

754
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,140
I am a virtuous

755
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,310
and innocent girl.

756
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,670
Why would I have your naked pictures?

757
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,030
I have no idea what you are like.

758
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,750
That's why I included that.

759
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,630
Fine. Well...

760
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,110
Well, for the sake of fairness,

761
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,990
I think this privacy rule

762
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,950
is applicable for the landlord, too.

763
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,590
Am I that bad?

764
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,950
You?

765
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,670
I...

766
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,670
Er Gou, let's go home!

767
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,070
Think about what to have for dinner.

768
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,470
It has to do with
your future as my tenant.

769
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,950
What do we have?

770
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,150
Eggs.

771
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,140
What else?

772
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,260
I don't remember.

773
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,510
Mr Zhou Chuan!

774
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,670
Save me!

775
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,110
Er Gou, we're not home yet.

776
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,030
Do you have to work yourself up?

777
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,630
Er Gou, hurry up.

778
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,900
Er Gou, I'm moving into your house.

779
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,230
Let me see your tiny eyes.

780
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,910
Er Gou, hurry up.

781
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,310
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

782
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,590
[The moon is so beautiful tonight.]

783
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,790
Mr Fox.

784
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,900
If a person

785
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,990
suddenly tells a girl that

786
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,270
the moon is so beautiful tonight,

787
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,500
what does it mean?

788
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,110
[Mr Fox.]

789
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,910
[If a person]

790
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,070
[suddenly tells a girl that]

791
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,270
[the moon is so beautiful tonight,]

792
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,470
[what does it mean?]

793
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,350
I couldn't help myself saying that.

794
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,590
What's gotten into me?

795
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:06,210
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

796
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,230
[Do you think he's talking
about the weather?]

797
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,750
[Or is it like what Natsume Soseki said?]

798
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,560
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

799
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,670
[That he likes you.]

800
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,660
He likes me?

801
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,590
Chu Li, why are you imagining things?

802
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,230
That's impossible.

803
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:34,720
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

804
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,150
[Sometimes, your instinct makes
the most truthful answer.]

805
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,550
[The meaning is]

806
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,710
[what you think it is.]

807
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,230
What did he mean?

808
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,120
[Instinct makes the most truthful answer.]

809
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,090
[Weather]
[Perfect for moon watching]

810
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,270
[Mr Fox.]

811
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,990
[I've just the weather.]

812
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,350
[Tonight is indeed a full-moon night.]

813
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,710
[And it's fullest than ever.]

814
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,470
[Maybe he's just
talking about the weather.]

815
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,310
[It can't be more than that.]

816
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,790
[In fact, that person is
a unicellular organism.]

817
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,310
[He could only perform amitosis]

818
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,460
[and self-reproduction.]

819
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,790
[There's no way he can
fall in love with anyone.]

820
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,590
[Of course,]

821
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,910
[I'm asking this for my friend.]

822
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,630
Unicellular organism?

823
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,590
You Stinky Monkey.

824
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,990
Why did I even say that?

825
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,070
Brother Cheng, here's your coffee.

826
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,990
Thanks.

827
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,750
Brother, are you waiting for someone?

828
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,630
Get back to work.

829
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,950
Okay.

830
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,690
[The Breaking Cocoon]

831
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,510
[I'm free tonight.]

832
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,710
[Can I meet with Mr Zhou Chuan]

833
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,110
[and talk about the collaboration?]

834
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,070
Why did you ask to see me, Mr Jiang?

835
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,790
Chu Li.

836
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,470
This is for you.

837
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,070
Consider a small gift
for spending your past two days

838
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,400
reading my manuscript.

839
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,270
No need.

840
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,510
It's my job to read your manuscript.

841
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,270
Moreover,

842
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,830
I enjoyed reading it.

843
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,380
It's the book written by my idol.

844
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,110
And it's the first manuscript.

845
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,830
Take it as a gift for my reader.

846
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,540
Well, thank you, Mr Jiang.

847
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,670
Unwrap it when you get home.

848
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,910
Get back to work now.

849
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,140
Oh, right.

850
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,830
Do you know

851
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,910
how to make Mr Zhou Chuan

852
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,470
do what he doesn't want to do?

853
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,420
For example,

854
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,190
having a meal with someone he hates.

855
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,270
Don't tell who that person is.

856
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,660
Just make him go there.

857
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,030
Would he hit me?

858
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,470
If that happens, just call me.

859
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,790
I'd stop him for you.

860
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,190
Fine. I'll get going, then.

861
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,590
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

862
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,750
You're back.

863
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,410
What are we having for dinner?

864
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,350
Mr Zhou Chuan.

865
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,750
I've specifically reserved
a table at a restaurant.

866
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,410
And I'd like to invite you
to have dinner with me.

867
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,470
Something smells fishy.

868
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,550
You're behaving more
obsequiously than usual.

869
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,150
Shoot. What's your motive?

870
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,950
Don't say like that.

871
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,180
It makes me upset.

872
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,990
With a purely grateful

873
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,070
and earnest heart,

874
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,750
I'd like to buy you a good meal

875
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,830
for letting me stay here rent-free.

876
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,950
I'm so sad.

877
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,950
I specifically booked the table.

878
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,620
And I thought you'd definitely like it.

879
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,380
All right, I'll go.

880
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,310
I've brought a mischief-maker home.

881
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,310
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.
