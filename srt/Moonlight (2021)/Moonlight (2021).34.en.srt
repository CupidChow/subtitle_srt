[Episode 34]

4
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,750
Chief Editor Yu just texted me.

5
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,550
She got hold of your fans.

6
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,870
They'll be supporting you

7
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,930
behind the live streaming tomorrow.

8
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,500
Please thank them on my behalf.

9
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,070
Mr Jiang sent us
the document appraisal too.

10
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,030
You have to keep your cool tomorrow.

11
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,430
Chu Li.

12
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,620
I want to publish my maiden work.

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,190
I plan to announce it

14
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,990
in the live stream tomorrow.

15
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,670
Have you really thought about it?

16
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,670
I really hope

17
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,870
I can help you publish it.

18
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,670
But I hope

19
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,430
you're giving me the manuscript

20
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,760
because you see me as managing editor,
not your girlfriend.

21
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,270
I know

22
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,260
announcing your plan
to publish your maiden work

23
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,070
will reinforce the interview,

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,150
but I really don't want you

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,190
to do something you don't want to
because of me.

26
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,860
I've thought about it.

27
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,990
I want you to publish it

28
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,710
as a managing editor.

29
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,010
The book will be called

30
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,910
The Jarred Bird Within My Dream.

31
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,600
Years of ups and downs are like a dream.

32
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,710
They were the pretty silhouette
of the jarred bird.

33
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,710
How does it sound?

34
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,550
Good.

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,150
Hello, Fang Peng?

36
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,950
It's me, Zhou Chuan.

37
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,180
I need a favour.

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,790
I'll be on a live stream tomorrow. I...

39
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,390
No, it's fine. It's fine.

40
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,510
Alright.

41
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,830
Chu Li, how is it going?

42
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,820
We haven't got hold of
the most crucial test paper yet.

43
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,750
But the other evidence

44
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,870
are almost ready now.

45
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,390
No matter what, the live stream
must go on today.

46
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,030
We have done what we can.

47
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,230
Let's hope everything goes well.

48
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,150
Everyone, look.
Mr Zhou Chuan posted on Weibo.

49
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,640
[Thanks for all the concern
everyone has showed me lately.]

50
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,870
[I've never expected that
a simple and obvious absurdity]

51
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,830
[can turn into an overwhelming suspicion.]

52
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,550
[Hence I've kept my silence.]

53
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,950
[After all, the moment]

54
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,790
[everyone decided to knock over someone,]

55
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,990
[all his words and deeds]

56
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,850
[will be exaggerated and
twisted intentionally.]

57
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,510
[I don't want to waste my words]

58
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,750
[in persuading a person]

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,810
[who has no intention to believe me
in the first place.]

60
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,150
[Proving that something never happened]

61
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,910
[has always been difficult.]

62
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,830
[I'd like to ask the importunate.]

63
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,630
[How should I explain]

64
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,300
[something I have never done?]

65
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,310
[What do you want hear?]

66
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,030
[The weak and poor excuses you expect,]

67
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,270
[I have none.]

68
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,950
[That is actually
my most truthful answer.]

69
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,270
[But I decided to
stand up for myself today.]

70
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,430
[Because I don't want to let these talks]

71
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,070
[hurt the people I care.]

72
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,590
[Believe]

73
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,750
[is a very extraordinary word.]

74
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,950
[If you're willing to believe,]

75
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,350
[at two o'clock this afternoon,]

76
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,909
[please tune in to Mr Shu Hua's
Interview with All]

77
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,310
[for my live interview.]

78
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,710
Going live in

79
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,790
three, two, one.

80
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,260
Welcome back.

81
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,870
We are very happy today

82
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,460
to have Mr Zhou Chuan
on our show once again.

83
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,870
Mr Zhou Chuan, welcome to the show.

84
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,710
Actually it's very rare that someone

85
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,670
appear in our show a second time

86
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,190
for interview.

87
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,700
I can understand why.

88
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,110
Let's get to the point.

89
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,030
Previously,

90
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,750
we got a tip-off from an internet user.

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,070
It says that,

92
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,060
conflicting your public image

93
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,830
as the Gentle and Kind Mr Chuan,

94
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,230
you're actually hot-tempered,

95
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,909
arrogant but incompetent.

96
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,470
Is that true?

97
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,030
What's with this Shu Hua?

98
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,550
Nothing good came out of his mouth.

99
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,070
Comments below are worse.

100
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,630
[Mr No-it-all is online.]

101
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,090
[What excuse is this? You think that's
convincing? The name sounds cheap too.]

102
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,909
[Get lost, you shoddy ghostwriter!]

103
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,990
[A novelist, my foot!]

104
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,990
[How dare he whitewash everything!
Really disgusting!]

105
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,270
Hang in there.

106
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,230
[Bark to a dog, talk to a person.]

107
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,470
[Whether gentle and kind]

108
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,790
[or arrogant and conceited,]

109
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,630
I think they are all me.

110
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,260
Not only this,

111
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,110
the tip-off also says

112
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,070
your relationship with your editor

113
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,310
is extraordinary.

114
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,640
How do you explain that?

115
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,510
That one is true.

116
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,270
She is my girlfriend.

117
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,550
That came out of nowhere.

118
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,020
[Our screen is exploding.]

119
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,900
[I'm actually]

120
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,870
[caught off guard]

121
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,830
[you would say this]

122
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,980
[in this interview.]

123
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,950
[Does this mean that]

124
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,380
[some of the tip-off is real?]

125
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,820
[I think]

126
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,820
[Don't comment if you know nothing.
Uncultured people should start reading.]

127
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,110
[if you want people to believe,]

128
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,790
[words need to be partly real.]

129
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,590
Hence I can be

130
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,470
very honestly open to you

131
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,110
that apart from

132
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,150
my relationship with my editor,

133
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,350
the rest are made-up.

134
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,909
Alright then. Let's go back to

135
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,750
the ghostwriting topic.

136
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,550
Mr Zhou Senior suddenly came out

137
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,990
to clarify this previously.

138
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,350
But it's a pity some netizens

139
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,310
just don't buy it.

140
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,430
Using this opportunity today,

141
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,630
do you have anything to put it out front?

142
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,710
This is a professional document appraisal.

143
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,630
You can have a look.

144
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,150
It states that the diction,
sentence structure and idea layout

145
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,500
are entirely different. Hence,

146
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,630
the ghostwriting

147
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,990
never happened.

148
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,420
It bears the seal of
forensic appraisal agency.

149
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,350
Yes.

150
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,260
But actually,

151
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,700
I don't think this is good enough.

152
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,150
Even if we have this appraisal statement,

153
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,540
but

154
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,470
for a mature writer,

155
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,710
I think ghostwriting

156
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,990
is totally possible using paraphrasing.

157
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,260
Is this appraisal

158
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,110
really reliable?

159
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,780
Prove this too?

160
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,470
How do you prove this?

161
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,870
Time travel?

162
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,600
Go back to record Zhou Chuan
typing out his story?

163
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,910
What a joke.

164
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,870
People are also supporting Zhou Chuan.

165
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,390
[It's already hard to determine writers]

166
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,870
[with the same writing styles.]

167
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,580
[How can you even start
if the styles are different?]

168
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,870
Why didn't you decide to show this

169
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,630
in the first place?

170
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,790
I thought everyone is smart enough.

171
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,270
I think our viewers
must have felt a sting.

172
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:10,990
Today I heard

173
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,340
we have some witnesses
on the line, haven't we?

174
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,590
Let's hear them out.

175
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,270
Hi there.

176
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,310
[Hi, I'm his former deskmate.]

177
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,430
[Everyone was fighting over his novels
at that time.]

178
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,340
[I even used this to
earn some extra money.]

179
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,630
[One buck to take it home for a week.]

180
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,750
[Alright. Let's listen to
the second caller.]

181
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,950
[I'm Zhou Chuan's class teacher.]

182
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,190
[All his essays at that time]

183
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,140
[were written like novels]

184
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,780
[A few teachers from
the teaching research group]

185
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,470
[fretted over this.]

186
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,830
[Story based writings are hard to mark.]

187
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,950
[Hence the marks for Zhou Chuan's essays]

188
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,670
[were often fluctuating.]

189
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,870
Alright. Thanks to our callers.

190
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,780
Zhou Chuan has

191
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
come to our show

192
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,430
well prepared today.

193
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,430
We have also talked to your father.

194
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,180
[He said that]

195
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,590
[prior to publishing Oriental Beauty,]

196
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,750
[you already wrote a manuscript
with hundreds of thousands words.]

197
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,100
[But why didn't you publish them?]

198
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,790
[This book was the reason that]

199
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,670
[led to the disagreement]

200
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,310
[between my father and I.]

201
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,430
[If this has]

202
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,030
[caused harm to people around me,]

203
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,110
[I'm willing to publish it.]

204
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,430
[Later I'll upload]

205
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,590
[The Jarred Bird Within My Dream
on the internet.]

206
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,590
After editing, it'll be published.

207
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,630
The Jarred Bird Within My Dream

208
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,510
Nice title.

209
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,350
[You've shown a lot of evidence today.]

210
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,390
Firstly, we have the callers.

211
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,910
Secondly, an appraisal document
like this.

212
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,830
As I see it,

213
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,660
these are indirect evidences.

214
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,950
Do you have

215
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,470
more to share with us?

216
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,360
[What else do you trolls want?
That's a lot of evidence already.]

217
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,910
These netizens are too much.

218
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,830
Someone wrote that
if the first book can be ghostwritten,

219
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,550
so can the next.

220
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,430
Another one said
he has been silent for too long.

221
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,230
He must have gotten his dad
to ghostwrite it again.

222
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,910
It's maddening.

223
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,110
Why are the haters still spamming?

224
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,190
Mr Zhou Chuan has taken out
so many evidences.

225
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,790
Why aren't they letting it go?

226
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,120
Public opinion warfare is a tough battle.

227
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,230
Maybe this time

228
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,550
we still can't win.

229
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,510
We thank Mr Zhou Chuan once again

230
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,830
for coming to the live stream.

231
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,030
As for the dispute on ghostwriting,

232
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,540
I believe that justice will prevail.

233
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,030
Thank you again for watching.

234
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,150
We'll meet again next time.

235
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,310
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

236
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,470
Wait.

237
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,630
I have the evidence.

238
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,790
This is my second test paper
during my senior year in high school.

239
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,310
You can see the storyline and key phrases

240
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,750
that is used in The Book of Luo He God.

241
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,950
I trust

242
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,950
this can prove that

243
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,310
the prototype of The Book of Luo He God

244
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,640
was already formed during my senior year.

245
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,260
You're the first guest in our show

246
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,790
who can show a high school test paper

247
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,110
to prove yourself.

248
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,390
This test paper looks worn out by time.

249
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,110
Please give this a close-up.

250
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,550
I just saw this paragraph

251
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,030
with the same phrasing as the book.

252
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,140
[Yes.]

253
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,950
[Actually, the reason
I decide to explain myself]

254
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,510
[is not to give an explanation]

255
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,180
[to those who don't wish me well.]

256
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,470
I just want to give

257
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,950
[those who never stopped believing me]

258
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,020
[an affirmation.]

259
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,270
He won.

260
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,990
[Right before the show ends,]

261
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,430
[I didn't expect...]

262
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,670
Our son has grown up.

263
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,110
Time to start cooking.

264
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,070
[Very good. We really thank you]

265
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,710
[for providing this direct evidence.]

266
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,660
[There is one question]

267
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,390
[I'm really curious about personally.]

268
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,050
[I don't know if I should ask.]

269
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,110
Go ahead.

270
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,230
I know that in your field of work,

271
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,110
the role of editor

272
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,870
is very much disputed.

273
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,900
[I think this is a job]

274
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,990
[with little presence.]

275
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,980
Anyone can do it.

276
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,790
You yourself

277
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,670
agreed to this previously.

278
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,940
But today you revealed

279
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,020
your relationship with your editor.

280
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,150
May I know when did you

281
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,390
have this change of heart?

282
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,070
I... I don't think this is a change.

283
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,030
I think this is more like

284
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,940
remember something you've forgotten.

285
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,580
We may have forgotten that
a long time ago

286
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,030
editor is like

287
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,070
a spirit.

288
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,630
In the publication of a book,

289
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,510
its formation

290
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,430
including content and diction

291
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,350
may show part of the writer.

292
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,220
[But there is also a part]

293
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,350
[which is the will of the editor.]

294
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,830
A long time ago,

295
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,830
an editor's role is like a spirit

296
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,090
that exists silently.

297
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,580
I think

298
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,200
it doesn't mean that

299
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,510
it's gone when it's forgotten.

300
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,190
When one day

301
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,710
you meet the right person,

302
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,110
you might

303
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,500
suddenly recall this.

304
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,670
Maybe many people think that

305
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,790
everything seems very smooth to me
from the beginning.

306
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,950
I don't need anyone to assist me.

307
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,150
Until the time when

308
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,710
I was defamed for ghostwriting,

309
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,870
I didn't even dare show my maiden work.

310
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,990
Only then I realize that

311
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,310
throughout my writing career,

312
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,590
I have a lot of regrets too.

313
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,180
[Maybe it's also because]

314
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,870
[I have been denied before,]

315
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,430
[I'm used to]

316
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,110
[using denial]

317
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,590
[to avoid many things.]

318
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,070
For example, I'll use denial

319
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,150
to deny my incompetence.

320
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,350
But it's my editor

321
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,670
who is constantly chasing me around

322
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,750
to tell what is wrong

323
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,390
or what needs improvement.

324
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,710
It's also her who forced me to
take part in the Huazhi Award.

325
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,270
It's also her who told me that

326
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,350
not being perfect

327
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,140
doesn't mean regret.

328
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,190
It's also her

329
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,850
who persistently reminded me

330
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,830
during this time that

331
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,440
there's light at the end of the tunnel.

332
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,110
Hence if you

333
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,660
really must ask me about it,

334
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,990
I'll tell you that

335
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,870
I,

336
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,110
Zhou Chuan,

337
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,590
have a very good editor.

338
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,530
And this person
happens to be my girlfriend.

339
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,490
I don't think
there's anything wrong with this.

340
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,110
Instead,

341
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,110
I rejoice it.

342
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,590
That's really great.

343
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,790
Don't worry.

344
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,790
Nobody will defame you anymore.

345
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,990
No, you fool. Nobody will

346
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,990
throw mud at you anymore.

347
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,350
How did you get the test paper?

348
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,870
Na Na gave it to me.

349
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,750
[Na Na, Song Xi's Assistant]

350
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,510
Song Xi has posted to clarify that

351
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,750
the decision to not collaborate

352
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,780
has nothing to do with
the ghostwriting scandal.

353
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,640
She also urged everyone
not to spread this anymore.

354
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,570
Looks like she has figured it out.

355
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,990
It wasn't that easy.

356
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,230
I asked Zhou Chuan about
the size of the bottle.

357
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,790
It's definitely 150 candies.

358
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,630
This one has 200 candies.

359
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,110
You can keep the extras.

360
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,370
If it's less than that, I'll compensate.

361
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,660
You're here to shame me, aren't you?

362
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,750
No.

363
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,870
Take the candies.

364
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,910
Let bygones be bygones.

365
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,950
What has this to do with you?

366
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,710
Get out of my sight.

367
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,190
The test paper...

368
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,110
You plan to return it to him, don't you?

369
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,190
If you didn't,

370
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,150
you won't agree to meet me.

371
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,630
I asked Zhou Chuan about your school days.

372
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,510
Please recall it again.

373
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,070
The person who stood up for you...

374
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,600
Would he really laugh at you
behind your back?

375
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,870
♫ As long as you give me
an affirmative look ♫

376
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,940
♫ My love... ♫

377
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,430
Hi there. This paper is for your class.

378
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,780
I'll put it here.

379
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,790
That was good.

380
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,430
You can join a girl group.

381
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,270
That was the first time
someone praised my singing.

382
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,670
Because of what he said,

383
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,670
I decided to become an artist.

384
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,780
But also because of what he said,

385
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,910
it's proof that he's not a good person.

386
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,790
He consoled and encouraged me
in my face

387
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,589
but laugh at me with the others
behind my back.

388
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,030
I beg you.

389
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,430
Make sure you stay till the end
when eavesdropping on others.

390
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,190
Large people are brave these days.

391
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,430
They can't see it themselves.

392
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,910
Don't you think so, Zhou Chuan?

393
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,150
Do they?

394
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,150
Then you mean

395
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,910
I shouldn't talk to them?

396
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,990
Yes. You're the school's prince charming.

397
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,630
If you talk to them,

398
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,750
-aren't you degrading yourself?
-That's right.

399
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,100
Then do you think

400
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,360
you're worthy to talk to me?

401
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,820
What are they?

402
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,700
Do I need your agreement

403
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,310
on whom I'm talking to?

404
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,470
I...

405
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,230
Impossible.

406
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,230
You're lying, aren't you?

407
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,270
You're doing this

408
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,590
for the test papers, aren't you?

409
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,870
I'm not that free to do that.

410
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,350
What is Zhou Chuan in your eyes?

411
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,020
He's kind,

412
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,550
gentle,

413
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,270
and talented.

414
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,350
He's perfect in my eyes.

415
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,990
In my eyes, he's not.

416
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,270
Although he has many strengths,

417
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,950
he's not perfect.

418
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,150
He can be like a kid sometimes.

419
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,470
Childish.

420
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,940
Bad-tempered.

421
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,990
When he hurt people,

422
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,550
it makes them mad.

423
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,390
But sometimes he can be weak.

424
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,270
He needs protection and care.

425
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,550
That is the person I like.

426
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,790
The one in your eyes

427
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,910
is only in your imagination.

428
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,630
That person doesn't exist.

429
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,350
No.

430
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,550
If the ghostwriting scandal
isn't clarified,

431
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,230
Zhou Chuan will be rebuked.

432
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,940
He'll never make a comeback.

433
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,420
Can you accept a defeated Zhou Chuan?

434
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,940
He won't be defeated.

435
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,310
Nobody can always win.

436
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,660
Stop living in the past.

437
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,790
That's just your imagination.

438
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,670
Don't let a false imagination

439
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,070
pull you back.

440
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,980
As for the test paper,

441
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,750
call me when you want to return it.

442
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,950
Don't let it tie you down.

443
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,110
Don't let it

444
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,980
turn you into a vengeful person.

445
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,750
You told her all that?

446
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,950
Of course.

447
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,710
We can't let everyone

448
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,950
continue to misunderstand you for it.

449
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,870
Of course we need to explain it.

450
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,590
Luckily Song Xi figured it out.

451
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,910
If not, you'll be doomed today.

452
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,710
It's good to have you.

453
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,790
It's good you know this.

454
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,750
Don't get involve in relationship scandals
like this anymore.

455
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,680
You're the one who provoke
the relationship with me.

456
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,590
That should be it.

457
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,910
Everyone worked hard today.

458
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,110
I'm really grateful.

459
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,180
No worries.

460
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,550
The anonymous interviewee outed Miao.

461
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,390
What? Let me see.

462
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,030
Look. After the live stream

463
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,990
and clarification by Song Xi on Weibo,

464
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,510
[It was Miao Jian Ping who tipped us off.]

465
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,670
the comments for this self-media
got flooded by netizens.

466
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,340
They not only apologized,

467
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,720
but also posted Miao's employee card.

468
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,030
I think this is a dispersion technique.

469
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,550
Netizens are now saying

470
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,350
this is the internal sabotage
in Yuan Yue Publishing House

471
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,280
and that Mr Zhou Chuan is innocent.

472
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,870
Xian Xian.

473
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,070
Go to the legal department now.

474
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,150
Legal department?

475
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,470
Miao defamed Yuan Yue
Publishing House during his employment.

476
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,990
We can't put up with a person like him.

477
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,750
You have been smiling at your phone
like a fool whole evening.

478
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,790
I'm looking at Weibo comments.

479
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,470
Now in Weibo,

480
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,800
everyone is anticipating your new novel.

481
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,390
Miao? Miao posted an apology video.

Trying to be a rogue again?

496
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,150
I don't know if it's because of

497
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,310
too much sitting at the office.

498
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,910

that we won't be collaborating.

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,270
Goodbye.

00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,470
Hello?

589
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,590
[Mr Zhou Chuan.]

590
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,550
[We've discussed about it.]

593
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,790
Initial fee?

594
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,910
That's not possible.

595
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,310

00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:45,990
[Alright.]

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,870
Goodbye.

598
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,220
I'm sorry.

599
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,110
Your legal department

600
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,300

601
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,830

We'll collaborate next time.

603
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,150
Are they asking about
The Jarred Bird Within My Dream?

604
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,070
Not only that.

605
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,630
A few previously stalled
collaborations too.

606
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,390
They all came back all at once.

607
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,310
They're really good at
taking advantage of the situation.

608
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,230
Seeking advantage is the nature
of a businessman.

609
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,670
After this disaster,

610
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,190
you're totally famous now.

611
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,270
Your business value is skyrocketing.

612

They have to bite the bullet
to knock on your door.

613
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,110
I won't accept their offer
even if they come to me.

614
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,310
I'm changing my phone number tomorrow.

615
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,070
Oh, right.

616
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,220
If Yuan Yue Publishing House calls you,

617
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,750
remember not to answer it.

618
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,790
Why?

619
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,870
Liang Chong Lang told me today

620
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,230
that I have to seal the deal
of your new novel.

621
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,190
Conditions are negotiable.

622
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,070
What did you say?

623
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,710
What else can I say?

624
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,100
Mr Zhou Chuan's phone

625
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,670
is going to explode.

626
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,270
Too many people wanted the deal.

627
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,150
They are open to any condition.

628
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,230
But as an editor of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

629
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,910
I'll work hard to persuade him.

630
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,390
Not bad. You're becoming sly.

631
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,910
That's because I've been living
with a sly fox.

632
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,190
Although you have agreed

633
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,260
to give me this deal,

634
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,750
we can't make it too easy
for Liang Chong Lang.

635
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,390
If not, he'll look down on you,

636
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,150
or other writers in future.

637
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,950
Why do I feel like I'm a small-time writer

638
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,940
belonging to an editor gang boss?

639
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,070
I didn't do anything at all

640
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,390
but I ended up at the peak of my career?

641
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,110
Then you better be a good boy

642
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,430
and fold all the laundry.

643
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,310
After that, clean up
the entire living room.

644
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,750
I'll call it a day now.

645
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,420
We'll meet tonight...

646
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,750
When did the contract with the writer

647
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,350
revise?

648
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,380
Why weren't I informed?

649
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,510
Alright, we'll talk later.

650
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,950
They have been approved
by the board directors.

651
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,630
There's nothing I can do about it.

652
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,190
According to this contract,

653
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,670
writers who just signed with us
will get almost nothing.

654
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,400
If they can't pay their bills,
how can they write?

655
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,150
Gu Bai Zhi.

656
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,190
Do you know how much we get

657
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,310
from high end writers

658
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,220
like Jiang Yu Cheng and Yun Fei?

659
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,550
We have to fill the money back

660
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,990
from other writers.

661
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,270
What do you think Xin Dun Books is?

662
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,670
A charity organization?

663
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,330
Does it give you the right
to use legal loopholes

664
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,070
to make writers give up

665
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,030
all their copyright?

666
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,350
What are you giving them?

667
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,670
What am I giving them?

668
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,030
Fame, of course.

669
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,030
Xin Dun Books will publish their work,

670
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,470
do publicity and promote their book.

671
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,430
The cost must be accounted for.

672
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,870
If you think this is reasonable,

673
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,550
why did you make the contract so vague?

674
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,590
Put it on paper.

675
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,100
Gu Bai Zhi.

676
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,070
If you didn't secure the deal
with Jiang Yu Cheng,

677
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,470
you think the board directors
will protect you?

678
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,470
Do you think you get to stay
in Xin Dun Books?

679
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,990
You better go back to your director role.

680
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,780
I'm letting you off this time.

681
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,710
I quit.

682
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,420
What do you mean?

683
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,740
I mean what I just said.

684
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,140
I'll give you my resignation report today.

685
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,510
Gu Bai Zhi.

686
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,130
You better be sure about this.

687
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,790
Alright, I got it.

688
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,190
Goodbye.

689
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,190
What's the matter, Chief Editor Yu?

690
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,550
I have a good news for you.

691
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,940
What is it?

692
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,270
Mr Xia has recommended you
to Director Yang

693
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,220
to take over Miao's position

694
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,540
as the deputy editor of second section.

695
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,390
Me? Deputy editor?

696
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,590
But Director Yang didn't just give in.

697
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,750
He proposed a condition.

698
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,870
He wants you to seal the deal
with Mr Zhou Chuan

699
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,800
on The Jarred Bird Within My Dream.

700
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,990
I know this.

701
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,190
Mr Liang told us two days ago.

702
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,230
That's right.

703
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,950
He gave Director Yang his promise

704
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,510
that he can seal that deal.

705
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,990
Hence I guess you'll have to

706
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,670
make a few work trips there.

707
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,630
I have to?

708
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,350
I think

709
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,550
although you're

710
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,710
in a relationship with Mr Zhou Chuan,

711
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,990
you have

712
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,870
to talk to Mr Zhou Chuan

713
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,630
impartially as an editor.

714
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,150
You can't use your relationship

715
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,510
to make the deal.

716
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,910
Don't worry, Chief Editor Yu.

717
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,440
I'll definitely do my best.

718
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,430
It's almost the time for Huazhi Awards
to announce winners.

719
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,150
If Mr Zhou Chuan can win,

720
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,830
Mr Xia can happily

721
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,350
retire.

722
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,630
Time really flies.

723
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,730
You'll be promoted as deputy editor?

724
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,030
The condition is that I seal your deal

725
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,960
on The Jarred Bird Within My Dream.

726
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,790
You won't only get my book.

727
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,070
You have gotten my entire being.

728
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,470
Stop fooling around.

729
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,270
Aren't you getting a promotion?

730
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,430
Why do I feel that

731
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,940
you're not happy about it?

732
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,110
Once Huazhi Awards ends,

733
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,350
Mr Xia will officially resign.

734
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,300
Working in Yuan Yue Publishing House
without Mr Xia,

735
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,230
I find it hard to imagine.

736
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,550
Meetings and partings are fated.

737
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,750
It's normal.

738
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,150
For example,

739
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,980
one day, I might cease to collaborate
with Yuan Yue Publishing House.

740
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,180
To console me at a time like this,

741
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,390
shouldn't you say,

742
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,230
don't worry,

743
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,230
you at least have me by your side?

744
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,670
As a writer,

745
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,100
I can't guarantee that.

746
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,830
But as a boyfriend,

747
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,910
I can say that.

748
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,110
Stop it.

749
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,750
Are you prepared for
the gala night of Huazhi Awards?

750
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,190
It's only a few days away.

751
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,150
What preparation do I need?

752
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,590
Getting nominated has given me
so much troubles.

753
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,110
Whether I win or not,

754
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,950
I don't care anymore.

755
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,390
You don't care? But I still do.

756
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,100
I prepared two suits for you this morning.

757
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,630
Have you tried them on?

758
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,870
I had.

759
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,470
They both look good.

760
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,070
I...

761
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,030
What did you say?
You tried them on already?

762
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,790
They look exactly the way
I left them this morning.

763
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,830
Try them on now.

764
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,630
Why do I need to?
I look good in anything.

765
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,830
Anything is fine.

766
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,030
Anything is fine? In that case,

767
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,670
go on stage in your shorts and slippers.

768
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,860
I... I don't believe this.

769
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,950
Quick. Take off your clothes.

770
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,710
You...

771
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,820
No, wait.

772
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,870
Do you know what you are doing?

773
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,110
Change your clothes.

774
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,170
Change my clothes?

775
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,420
Change my clothes? Change my clothes?

776
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,390
I'll let you change my clothes.

777
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,790
Someone's here.

778
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,470
They got the wrong door.

779
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,790
Dad. Mum.

780
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,550
Get up now.

781
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,220
Look at you.

782
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,630
How much do you know about Zhou Chuan?

783
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,270
How can you live with him?

784
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,870
I know him.

785
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,510
His name is Zhou Chuan.
He is 28 years old.

786
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,670
He is from Suzhou.

787
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,350
He is a best-selling author.

788
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,150
How long

789
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,750
did you live together?

790
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,150
Two years.

791
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,510
Two?

792
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,510
When she came to Shanghai,

793
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,100
you two started to live together?

794
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,070
No.

795
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,030
We sleep in separate rooms.

796
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,090
We definitely don't do anything
we're not supposed to.

797
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,370
What was that just now?

798
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,420
We were trying out new suits.

799
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,590
He is just being kind?

800
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,110
He's not only meticulous and serious,

801
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,970
but also intelligent and gentle.

802
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,470
This is...

803
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,710
Let me cool it off for you.

804
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,270
He's serious and responsible at work.

805
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,910
Work calls.

806
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,790
Not important.

807
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,990
Moreover, he's especially good and true.

808
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,790
Uncle Chu.

809
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,830
Honestly since very little,
I especially admire

810
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,660
your kind of heroic career.

811
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,050
I'm just small-time police officer.

812
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,590
My daily work is

813
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,510
helping the old lady look for her cat,

814
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,630
mediate the disputes
in the neighbourhood and so on.

815
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,670
That sounds good.

816
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,350
A normal life is a good life.

817
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,180
He's really a rare catch.

818
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,350
I'm not interested in your empty talk.

819
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,510
I'm asking you

820
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,750
if he treats you good.

821
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,070
He treats me especially good.
Look at this room.

822
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,990
He decorated it.

823
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,030
He knows I like to run about bare-footed,

824
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,070
so he covered the floor with carpet.

825
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,190
The mattress and blankets

826
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,300
were bought according to my likings.

827
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,230
He worried that I have too many clothes,

828
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,469
so he specially ordered this wardrobe.

829
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,870
[They are made of recycled materials.]

830
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,989
[You see how diligent he is.]

831
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,710
Really not bad.

832
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,190
People say

833
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,870
daughters belong to the in-laws
once they are married.

834
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,909
You're already siding him.

835
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,469
Trust me, mum.

836
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,670
He's really good to me.

837
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,580
Fine. I'll trust you.

838
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,870
Is the ghostwriting scandal solved?

839
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,070
It's solved.

840
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,179
There's a live stream link online.

841
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,590
That's good then.

842
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,699
You didn't know

843
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,830
how worried your dad is

844
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,550
when he knew about it.

845
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,110
He just had to come and see you.

846
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,750
How can he not worry?

847
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,310
He took the trouble to apply for leave

848
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,969
and rushed here immediately.

849
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,870
I know you love me the most.

850
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,870
Uncle Chu.

851
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,110
Do you have

852
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,230
any interest or hobby?

853
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,270
My work keeps me busy.

854
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,630
Where do I get the time

855
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,350
for hobbies?

856
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,490
Can you play cards?

857
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,110
Cards?

858
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,950
Not really.

859
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,420
Mahjong?

860
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,350
Not exactly.

861
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,270
But I can learn.

862
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,700
Don't tell me

863
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,390
you can't even drink.

864
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,830
Drink?

865
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,300
That I'm good.

866
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,650
Here you go, Uncle Chu.

867
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,470
This cup is too small.

868
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,870
Then I'll...

869
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,790
Didn't you forget what happened
when you last drank?

870
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,750
Don't worry. I know what to do.

871
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,590
Uncle, look.

872
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,700
It isn't really any bigger.

873
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,950
I got it.

874
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,380
How about this?

875
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,510
Dad, it's good enough.

876
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,830
It's good enough.

877
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,990
Zhou, what do you think?

878
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,270
This one then.

879
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,190
Uncle Chu, a toast to you.

880
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,670
I'll drink up.

881
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,870
Good, young man.

882
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,390
I'll drink up too.

883
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,350
No, no, Uncle Chu.

884
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,250
I... I'll propose another toast.

885
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,310
Thank you both for
letting Chu Li be my girlfriend.

886
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,760
You do have to thank us for that.

887
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,380
Here.

888
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,350
I'll drink to that.

889
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,870
Drink.

890
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,790
Brother...

891
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,860
You just let go all your worries.

892
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,260
I'll be good to Chu Li only

893
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,270
in this life.

894
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,510
Brother?

895
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,710
Good.

896
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,220
Buddy.

897
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,390
You have to remember what you said.

898
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,270
Cheers.

899
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,870
Can you not drink anymore?

900
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,590
We have to drink quickly.

901
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,230
My daughter's mother

902
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,770
is especially fierce.

903
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,630
She's really fierce.

904
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,660
Chu Li is fierce too.

905
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,150
The last time I drank,

906
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,790
she scolded me.

907
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,550
Tell me what's wrong for us guys

908
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,310
to drink a little.

909
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,430
What's wrong?

910
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,350
That's right. What...

911
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,830
What's wrong with having a few drinks?

912
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,150
That's right. What's wrong about it?

913
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,190
Is it so funny?

914
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,390
Not this book.

915
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,870
I was just thinking that

916
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,460
Zhou Chuan must be suffering tonight.

917
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,300
I've resigned.

918
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,390
I've resigned.

919
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,310
The upper management of Xin Dun Books
is just equally dishonourable.

920
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,310
They'll push low for the sake of profit.

921
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,950
Do you know that

922
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,590
the newly signed writers

923
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,140
will get almost nothing?

924
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,910
Hello? Director Zhang.

925
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,030
You caught the news too?

926
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,030
I'll consider it.

927
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,390
Thanks, Director Zhang.

928
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,190
He's from Wen Hai?

929
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,220
Wen Hai is not bad.

930
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,790
Director Zhang is quite sensible
about content.

931
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,750
He's already called a few times before.

932
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,750
He wants me as the content director.

933
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,110
A lot of companies will call you.

934
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,370
You can pick the right one after that.

935
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,870
What if I

936
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,810
don't want to go to any of them?

937
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,930
I want to build my own company.

938
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,990
Your own company?

939
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,750
Actually there's a lot of

940
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,510
quality intellectual property

941
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,510
that can't be made into movie.

942
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,150
Like Zhou Chuan's stories.

943
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,510
They're all oriental fantasies.

944
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,910
The investment capital is high,

945
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,950
and the editing takes too much work.

946
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,110
So in the first place, why not

947
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,710
register it as movie customization
intellectual property?

948
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,670
I have been thinking about this
for a long time.

949
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,190
Instead of hopping from
one company to another,

950
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,270
why don't I take hold of the initiative?

951
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,150
Why are you silent?

952
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,270
I'm thinking.

953
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,630
I have a space in my bookstore.

954
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,310
You can use it as your temporary office.

955
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,470
What about your start-up capital?

956
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,900
I have some savings.

957
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,790
In that case,

958
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,790
the book I signed with Xin Dun Books

959
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,150
has not published yet.

960
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,870
I'll terminate the contract tomorrow.

961
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,730
Then I can become the first writer
of your platform.

962
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,770
You also need a partner
who knows technologies.

963
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,010
And I happen to have a friend for that.

964
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,150
I want to kiss you.

965
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,010
Then don't hold that thought.

966
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,670
Good morning, Uncle Chu.

967
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,160
Do you want some coffee?

968
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,430
Please have a seat first.

969
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,600
Here's your coffee.

970
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,710
Sit down.

971
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,260
Sit. Sit.

972
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,510
Well...

973
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,070
Last night

974
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,420
I lost control.

975
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,590
Don't keep it in your heart.

976
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,390
I was too drunk to remember.

977
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,670
What happened?

978
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,030
I can't really recall.

979
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,700
The porridge must be ready.

980
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,550
I'll go take a look.

981
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,950
No, don't go.

982
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,270
Sit, sit.

983
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,630
Well...

984
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,510
The house work...

985
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,390
Who does it normally?
