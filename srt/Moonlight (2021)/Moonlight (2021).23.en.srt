You're still here?

It's okay, Chu Li.

when it comes to publication.

Didn't you listen to the weather forecast?

66

It's supposed to rain at this hour.

67
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,510
It will stop later.

68
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,670
Besides,

asked you out for dinner.

75
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,800

What did you say?

00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,990
He asked you out too, didn't he?

78
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,070
What is it?

79
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,270
Are you in a bad mood?

80
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,870
And why did you bring up

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,400
the girlfriend topic
all of a sudden just now?

82
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,340
Forget it. Never mind.

83
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,030
By the way, I talked to Yu Yao today.

84
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,510
I'm almost done with my research.

85
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,770

89
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,390
Tell me what you want. I'll buy it.

I heard that you fell sick
and hurt your back

97
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,740
because of me.

98
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,430
My apologies.

99
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,310
Please don't mind
about the contract termination.

100
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,220
It's okay. It's my honour to help you

101
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,300
get your book published.
All my efforts are worth it.

102
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,910
Hi. Today is Valentine's Day.

103
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,460
We are holding an event.

If a man confesses to the lady he likes,

105

they will be given a bouquet of flower.

106
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,110
Do you need it?

107
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,910
Ask him.

108
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,310
Me?

109
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,680
Never mind.
I don't celebrate Valentine's Day.

110
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,590
Sorry for disturbing.

111
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,500
Enjoy your meal.

112
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,950
I'll answer the call outside.

113
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,830
Don't tell me

114
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,620
you prepared nothing for Valentine's Day.

115
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,070
Do I need to tell you?

116
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,670
No.

117
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,310
But you need to let Chu Li know.

118
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,510
This is your

119
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,070
first Valentine's Day, after all.

120
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,950
You're acting like you don't care at all.

121
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,670
I want to let her feel disappointed

122
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,390
before showing my surprising gift.

123
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,500
You know nothing
for someone who had a girlfriend.

124
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,150
Fine.

125
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,110
You're getting tricky.

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,020
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

127
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,510
The Disappearing Amusement Park

128
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,230
is of high importance to the higher-ups.

129
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,590
They increased the marketing fee

130
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,630
and have promised to publish it

131
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,150
in one month.

132
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,950
Is that true? Awesome.

133
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,990
I'm having dinner with Mr Jiang.

134
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,710
I'll tell him now.

135
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,670
You're having dinner with him?

136
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,270
Isn't it Valentine's Day?

137
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,310
You two...

138
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,750
Nothing like that.

139
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,190
Mr Jiang wanted to buy me a meal

140
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,430
to thank me. That's all.

141
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,190
Mr Zhou Chuan is here too.

142
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,380
Calm down.

143
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,790
Many writers and editors

144
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,630
fell in love too in the past.

145
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,390
[If you're together,]

146
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,390
I will give you my sincere blessing.

147
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,950
But doesn't Mr Zhou Chuan

148
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,150
have a girlfriend? If I'm not mistaken.

149
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,430
I think so.

150
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,110
He's eating with you guys

151
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,910
[instead of being with his girlfriend?]

152
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,670
[What a funny guy.]

153
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,270
So, enjoy your dinner.

154
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,070
I'm just calling to let you know.

155
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,310
Okay. Bye.

156
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,790
Mr Jiang.

157
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,350
I have a good news for you.

158
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,430
Chief Editor Yu said
the higher-ups think really highly

159
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,030
of The Disappearing Amusement Park

160
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,299
that they added
a huge sum of marketing fee,

161
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,429
and promised to

162
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,470
publish the book in a month.

163
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,390
That means it won't clash

164
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,390
with Huang Quan Inn's publication.

165
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,590
Too bad.

166
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,710
I thought of competing with you.

167
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,910
Chief Editor Yu also asked

168
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,230
if you want

169
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,430
a signing event on the launching day.

170
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,870
Signing event?

171
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,310
Okay.

172
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,350
When the speech on the film was cancelled,

173
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,950
it was a pity for many
fans who were at the event.

174
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,470
Thank you, Mr Jiang.

175
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,670
I will see to it that
your book is published.

176
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,390
Can we not talk about work

177
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,310
and just enjoy our meal?

178
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,110
By the way, Chu Li,

179
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,500
I heard you went to see Director Lu Fang

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,590
on the aeroplane.

181
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,550
You even talked through the entire flight.

182
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,340
It was so close.

183
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,870
When I got to Linzhou,

184
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,390
he already passed the custom.

185
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,230
Fortunately, I booked a ticket

186
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,110
of the same flight in advance.

187
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,460
That's how we stopped him on the plane.

188
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,470
"We"?

189
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,630
Me. Alone.

190
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,310
Luckily, it was a domestic flight.

191
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,710
I couldn't have done anything

192
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,510
if he was going abroad.

193
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,230
Chu Li.

194
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,090
Does Gu Bai Zhi have anything to do

195
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,840
with my cooperation with Director Lu?

196
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,230
Why did you ask that?

197
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,310
Just tell me.

198
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,950
Yes or no.

199
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,590
Yes.

200
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,270
Like what you thought.

201
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,870
The only person who can solve this

202
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,550
or would think of this idea,

203
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,100
and realise it

204
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,950
is Director Gu.

205
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,790
I heard from Mr Zhou Chuan

206
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,190
that you tried to have Mr Jiang

207
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,830
collaborate with Director Li Yu,

208
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,340
but you failed.

209
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,830
The only director
who is as famous as him

210
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,760
in the country is Director Lu Fang.

211
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,270
So, is it possible

212
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,070
to help me contact him?

213
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,590
If The Disappearing Amusement Park
can be made into film,

214
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,110
the book can definitely be published.

215
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,830
Why should I help you?

216
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,070
We can persuade Director Lu Fang

217
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,390
to make a series of the film.

218
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,150
By then, you can also sell

219
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,750
the copyright of Yun Fei's work.

220
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,910
These two writers have similar style.

221
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,590
Yun Fei's can somehow
get some popularity back.

222
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,670
I thought you'd play the emotion card

223
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,670
and say Jiang Yu Cheng missed the speech

224
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,430
because of me.

225
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,980
That's the truth, isn't it?

226
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,990
But I'm sure

227
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,630
that even if I don't bring it up,

228
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,790
you'd still try to help him.

229
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,230
You could've just left it to me.

230
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,470
No way.

231
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,750
I'm in charge of him.

232
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,070
I will spare no effort to help him.

233
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,990
And I don't know about you.

234
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,260
So I must

235
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,870
get things under my control.

236
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,950
Let's work together.

237
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,030
Really?

238
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,390
But on one condition.

239
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,590
What's that?

240
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,950
Don't tell Jiang Yu Cheng.

241
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,590
Not only did Director Gu help me,

242
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,430
she even found out
about Director Lu Fang's schedule,

243
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,470
and quickly drove me to Linzhou.

244
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,900
When the tire blew out,

245
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,350
she fixed it on the road.

246
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,910
Her only condition

247
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,990
is not to let you know about it.

248
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,780
It suddenly occurred to me
that I have something on.

249
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,870
You guys enjoy.

250
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,390
Look at you. You must've caught a cold.

251
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,910
Drink warm water
the first thing you get home.

252
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,990
[Drink warm water?
An insensitive man, indeed.]

253
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,630
Put my interest first next time.

254
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,830
Stop working so hard for Jiang Yu Cheng.

255
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,590
I'm in charge of him.

256
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,230
Who else would fight for him if not me?

257
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,310
By the way,

258
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,230
did Gu Bai Zhi say something
I can't listen to the other day?

259
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,270
As she refused to let me enter.

260
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,100
She only gave me a reminder.

261
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,540
I'll get going.

262
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,270
The relationship
between an editor and a writer

263
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,940
isn't really romantic.

264
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,670
It will be harder for you

265
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,970
when the guy is Zhou Chuan.

266
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,390
"It will be harder when the guy

267
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,270
is Zhou Chuan?"

268
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,470
What did she mean?

269
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,830
Is it because she and Jiang Yu Cheng

270
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,110
didn't end well

271
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,910
that she tried to poison your mind?

272
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,340
She's just jealous.

273
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,790
Don't discuss her
experience in the future.

274
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,190
Mr Zhou, I think you should

275
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,150
reflect on yourself instead.

276
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,110
Look.

277
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,710

279
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,980
I think Director Gu is right.

280

It's a secret.

285

00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,710
his sick girlfriend alone

375
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,380
in the dark house.

376
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,750
Hi, I need cold medicine.

377
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,150
The medicine we eat if we catch a cold.

378
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,310
Okay.

379
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,830
This one will do.

380
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,310
Drink with warm water.

381
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,390
You'll be fine with some warm water.

382
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,470
I'll have this one.

383
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,510
Okay.

384
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,100
The power panel is right behind the porch.

385
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,030
It can be fixed easily.

386
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,070
Er Gou, why aren't you sleeping yet?

387
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,070
Er Gou.

388
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,990
Isn't this pyjamas my present to...

389
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,690
[Stinky Monkey, after years of fighting,
you can have my favourite book. Mr Fox]

390
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,750
The power is back on already?

391
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,190
The circuit breaker tripped.

392
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,300
But I fixed it.

393
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,670
You're sick. Just stay in your room.

394
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,030
Why come downstairs?

395
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,230
Here.

396
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,710
Take the medicine.

397
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,060
Mr Zhou.

398
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,630
I found something interesting.

399
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,670
This pyjamas.

400
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,230
It was Mr Fox's birthday gift from me.

401
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,790
And the Natsume Soseki's book.

402
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,830
Why is Mr Fox's signature here?

403
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,110
Can you explain?

404
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,070
What's going on?

405
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,130
Why did you enter my study room again?

406
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,430
Is that the only thing
you have to say to me?

407
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,580

[In front of you.]

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,700
When did you find out that I'm Monkey?

412
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,400
A few days before
the Book of Luo He God's signing event.

413
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,270
It was half a year ago.

414
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,070
Why didn't you tell me?

415
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,870
I didn't see the need,

416
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,670
-so...
-You didn't see the need?

[Added to Blocked list]

418
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,670
You blocked me?

419
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,670
Aren't you childish?

420
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,870
You might as well block my real account.

421
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,190
I don't want to talk to you.

422
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,380
Where are you going?

423
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,870
I have no idea.

424
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,110
But I'm not talking to a liar now.

425
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,750
Does it matter if I'm Mr Fox?

426
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,510
Does it not?

427
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,030
Don't you know

428
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,350
I've always regarded Mr Fox

429
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,510
as my best friend?

430
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,220
You've been using this identity

431
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,030
to spy on my life,

432
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,550
thoughts and even feelings.

433
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,820
What did you say when I asked

434
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,070
if you're Mr Fox?

435
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,790
Yes, I denied it.

436
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,550
That's because I...

437
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,550
Because you never wanted to tell me.

438
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,030
It must be fun

439
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,390
fooling me with two accounts.

440
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,670
So you never planned to stop.

441
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,190
Or maybe in your mind,

442
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,020
an insignificant editor like me

443
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,630
doesn't deserve to have
a popular writer like you

444
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,910
to be my internet friend?

445
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,150
Why must you

446
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,830
make it so complicated? This...

447
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,990
That should be my line.

448
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,030
All this while,

449
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,710
you can't stop making fun of me.

450
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,870
Let me tell you.

451
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,990
I won't continue

452
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,110
such a childish game.

453
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,350
Let's stop it here. Let's break up.

454
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,110
Break up, you say?

455
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,350
Who would put himself

456
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,910
on the line for just a game?

457
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,270
Put on the line?

458
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,350
I'm the one who was kept in the dark.

459
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,410
Yet you said you suffered the losses?

460
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,230
Ridiculous.

461
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,310
I do

462
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,030
feel like I am a monkey

463
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,350
being fooled now.

464
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,750
He lied to me all this time.

465
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,350
Am I a fool to him?

466
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,870
Hello, Jiang Yu Cheng.

467
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,870
You got it right again, jinx.

468
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,390
This is bad.

469
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,030
Er Gou.

470
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,990
After I'm out of here,

471
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,870
don't forget to eat.

472
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,030
Don't be like someone.

473
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,910
She went to work already?

474
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,060
She's trying to avoid me again.

475
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,870
Chu Li.

476
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,440
Why are you spacing out?

477
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,070
Ah Xiang.

478
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,110
Can I

479
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,150
stay at your place for a day or two?

480
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,670
What happened?

481
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,630
Did your new landlord kick you out?

482
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,760
That's not the case.

483
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,990
The Disappearing Amusement Park

484
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,150
is going to launch earlier, isn't it?

485
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,430
My workload suddenly becomes heavier.

486
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,150
Your house is near the printing factory.

487
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,980
So, it's more convenient.

488
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,750
Sure.

489
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,790
Just move in.

490
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,870
Really?

491
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,950
I'm ready.

492
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,630
No problem.

493
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,620
Thank you.

494
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,110
You called me in the middle of the night

495
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,070
just because

496
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
she found out you're Mr Fox

497
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,830
and you don't know what to do about it?

498
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,270
Don't gloat over that.

499
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,110
You still

500
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,180
don't stand a chance.

501
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,070
I'm already over her.

502
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,190
I regard her as my sister now.

503
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,460
If I were her,

504
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,630
given how my boyfriend

505
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,630
neglected our first Valentine's Day,

506
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,670
and lied to me,

507
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,070
I would certainly

508
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,230
break up with you.

509
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,110
Shut up.

510
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,630
Now that makes me furious.

511
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,150
How could she say "break up" so easily?

512
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,270
Who am I to her?

513
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,710
Are you sure you want me to shut up?

514
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,190
Fine. I thought you asked me out

515
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,700
to give you advice.

516
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,750
Say it already.

517
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,070
Firstly, you must apologise.

518
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,070
Then,

519
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,350
be it she's angry about

520
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,590
you denying to be Mr Fox,

521
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,260
or not preparing for Valentine's Day,

522
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,790
when she said she wants a break up,

523
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,100
that means she feels insecure.

524
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,950
Simply put,

525
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,910
she is unconfident

526
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,950
about your relationship.

527
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,430
Unconfident?

528
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,430
I never said no to her.

529
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,470
I even did things I wouldn't do

530
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,660
in the past.

531
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,420
Men and women

532
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,740
are totally different.

533
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,710
Sometimes, we think

534
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,070
that we've done everything,

535
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,510
and that living harmoniously together

536
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,580
is the promise we gave.

537
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,190
But diamond rings, flowers,

538
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,550
and being romantically ceremonious

539
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,550
mean more to girls.

540
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,300
It

541
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,990
might be a white lie to you.

542
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,350
But to her,

543
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,030
if you would lie on a small matter,

544
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,110
then you might also
lie about important things.

545
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,630
She may think that you've never wanted
to spend the rest of your life with her.

546
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,740
That's not right.

547
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,590
She's my chosen one.

548
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,550
Had you told Chu Li earlier,

549
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,150
things would have been fine.

550
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,430
What should I do now?

551
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,030
It's easy

552
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,560
to ask for her forgiveness.

553
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,540
When you see her next time,

554
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,910
apologise first.

555
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,940
Then, hold her in your arms.

556
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,230
And kiss her.

557
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,710
Then say it out loud

558
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,870
that you like her,

559
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,790
you love her,

560
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,630
and that she's fated to be yours.

561
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,160
Is such pretension and
exaggeration necessary?

562
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,870
Prepare to get dumped then.

563
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,870
Not really.

564
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,350
Maybe to Chu Li,

565
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,110
she's not dumping you.

566
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,310
It could be

567
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,630
simply wonderful moments
that didn't end well.

568
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,190
Look at you.

569
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,550
Despising me for falling in love.

570
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,150
Annoying.

571
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,700
Same to you,

572
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,830
you highly

573
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,340
ignorant guy.

574
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,940
What have Chu Li done wrong?

575
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,510
Ah Xiang.

576
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,230
If... I mean, if.

577
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,470
If you found out that the person you like

578
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,790
is actually your
long time internet friend,

579
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,150
who has been keeping the truth from you

580
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,630
even after learning it

581
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,590
a long time ago,

582
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,990
and he created two accounts to fool you,

583
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,070
not planning

584
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,510
to tell you the truth.

585
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,020
What would you do then?

586
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,630
Is it about your friend?

587
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,870
Chu Li.

588
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,630
I think that guy has gone too far.

589
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,510
Right?

590
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,670
This is irritating,

591
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,030
isn't it?

592
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,350
That was my first ever Valentine's Day.

593
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,310
Not only did I receive any present,

594
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,870
I even found out that he is a liar.

595
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,110
This is too much for me to take.

596
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,750
You finally admit

597
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,830
that you are the friend.

598
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,190
Did you realise that long ago?

599
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,070
Well, not exposing someone is a virtue.

600
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,390
You won't be mad at me, will you?

601
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,510
Of course not.

602
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,390
You kept quiet
so that I won't feel awkward.

603
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,750
It's different from that heartless guy.

604
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,390
Don't be mad, Chu Li.

605
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,390
Ignore him.

606
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,710
Let's go home.

607
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,750
Exactly what I thought.

608
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,710
Where is she?

609
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,590
Why isn't she home yet?

610
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,350
How come her luggage isn't here?

611
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,630
[Where are you?]

612
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,770
[Zhou Chuan]

613
00:32:47,810 --> 00:33:12,850
[Little Monkey]

614
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,140
[Ah Xiang's place.]

615
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,190
[I'm staying here for now.]

616
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,950
[You won't even feed Er Gou?]

617
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,230
[What does your
conscience say about that?]

618
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,710
[Running away from home just like that.]

619
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,590
[Aren't you incredible?]

620
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,350
[So you're rich now?]

621
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,430
Okay.

622
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,600
[Zhou Chuan]

623
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,020
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour: Okay]

624
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,950
What... What's wrong?

625
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,550
Did that guy say something?

626
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,620
Nothing. Don't bring him up.

627
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,500
I plan

628
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,270
to buy a cheap spring bed

629
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,430
and stay longer here.

630
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,110
Is that okay?

631
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,150
Sure.

632
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,150
Stay as long as you like.

633
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,910
This is really tasty.

634
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,300
I want to buy ten more.

635
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,790
Which flavour would you like?

636
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,790
I love the braised meat one.

637
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,389
Someone

638
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,150
irresponsibly broke

639
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,070
my 28-year-long

640
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,030
unrestrained lifestyle,

641
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,260
and made me getting used to

642
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,020
eating on proper time.

643
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,310
But now?

644
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,050
All of a sudden,
I no longer have meals ready on time.

645
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,909
Wouldn't you

646
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,469
feel upset?

647
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,070
You at least have your canned food.

648
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,830
But me?

649
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,550
I have nothing to eat.

650
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:12,660
[Zhou Chuan: Where are you? Little Monkey:
Ah Xiang's place for now. Zhou Chuan: Okay.]

651
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,630
It's been a week.

652
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,560
She doesn't even bother to
urge me to deliver my work.

653
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,030
Is she really not coming back?

654
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,070
Who's that?

655
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,660
Hi.

656
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,630
I'm here to clean the house.

657
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,750
Did you make a mistake?

658
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,870
Excuse me.

659
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,230
Hello, Jiang Yu Cheng.

660
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,110
Hello.

661
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,070
Chu Li isn't home.

662
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,420
Isn't it time to clean your house?

663
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,950
I ordered a cleaner for you.

664
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,310
She should have arrived.

665
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,790
Mind your own business.

666
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,910
Thanks.

667
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,270
Hi.

668
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,750
I'm a cleaner.

669
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,470
Did you order a three-hour
cleaning service?

670
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,310
Where should I work on?

671
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,790
Come on in.

672
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,830
Okay.

673
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,510
So,

674
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,030
do as you see fit.

675
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,390
Okay.

676
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,030
No, Jiang Yu Cheng.

677
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,950
How do you know Chu Li isn't at my house?

678
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,030
I even know
she's staying at Ah Xiang's place.

679
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,940
How could you only reply an "okay"?

680
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,790
I'm speechless.

681
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,270
I spent hours

682
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,340
explaining to you the mindset of a woman.

683
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,870
Did you keep it in mind?

684
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,230
Hold on.

685
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,830
You haven't told me

686
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,030
how did you know Chu Li isn't at my house?

687
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,460
Are you two together?

688
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,950
We're checking on the
book cover at the printing factory.

689
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,070
[I'll try to get you]

690
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,230
[Ah Xiang's address.]

691
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,710
[Don't let the chance slip.]

692
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,630
Remember, no matter what,

693
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,390
apologise first.

694
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,670
Oka...

695
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,960
Stop nagging. I'm hanging up. Bye.

696
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,620
I can drive you home.

697
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,830
Never mind.

698
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,070
Ah Xiang's place is just
two train stations away.

699
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,030
It's convenient.

700
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,390
No problem.

701
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,340
Since it's near,

702
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,100
I can get you home very quickly.

703
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,110
Then, thanks, Mr Jiang.

704
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,630
I should be thanking you.

705
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,950
It's been a while

706
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,680
since I saw my own new book cover

707
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,950
that I thought I won't

708
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,610
get to publish books anymore.

709
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,590
Don't say that.

710
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,230
Being able to

711
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,380
publish your book

712
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,750
still seems unrealistic to me even today.

713
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,150
When I saw the book cover,

714
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,550
I got so emotional that
I couldn't sleep for nights.

715
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,350
I guess when I see the real book,

716
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,110
I will cry out of excitement.

717
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,310
But I think there's another reason

718
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,150
why you couldn't sleep.

719
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,230
No, there isn't.

720
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,270
Let's go.

721
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,990
Give me Ah Xiang's address.

722
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,830
Come on, Er Gou.

723
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,310
Go, Er Gou.

724
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,550
Why are you here, Er Gou?

725
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,950
What a coincidence.

726
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,750
You talk. I'll get going.

727
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,350
Thank you, Mr Jiang.

728
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,390
Why are you here?

729
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,180
I'm walking my dog.

730
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,030
You sure have been walking far.

731
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,510
Carry on. I'm leaving.

732
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,310
Do you really hate to see me that much?

733
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,950
Why do you pull a long
face when you see me,

734
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,710
and keep smiling when
you see Jiang Yu Cheng?

735
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,470
He doesn't lie to me.

736
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,510
Nor did he fool me
with different accounts.

737
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,630
And he didn't live in a house with you,

738
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,590
or cook and walk the dog with you.

739
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,910
Fine. I don't want to talk to you.

740
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,180
What do you mean by "fine"?

741
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,620
Like, let's break up?

742
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,140
What am I to you?

743
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,390
A writer.

744
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,740
An internet friend.

745
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,270
A boyfriend.

746
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,550
Or neighbour?

747
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,630
I don't even know.

748
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,070
Let me ask you.

749
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,830
If I hadn't found it out,

750
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,990
when would you tell me the truth?

751
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,190
Must you

752
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,260
know everything

753
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,860
about your internet friend?

754
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,990
So you don't think you did anything wrong.

755
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,630
What's the point of coming to see me?

756
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,950
I'm just taking Er Gou here to ask

757
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,590
when will you come home?

758
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,630
You've stayed too long here.

759
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,070
It's time to come home.

760
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,260
Er Gou and I have lost weight.

761
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,270
It's not my business.

762
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,790
I'm not your maid.

763
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,070
Chu Li.

764
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,950
You're back from the printing factory?

765
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,390
Hi, Mr Zhou Chuan.

766
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,630
Er Gou is here too?

767
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,230
I...

768
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,990
Did I disturb you?

769
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,110
No, we're done.

770
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,070
Mr Zhou Chuan was going to leave.

771
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,030
Yes.

772
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,710
I can't deliver my new
outline on time anyway.

773
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm just telling you. Bye.

774
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,510
-Let's go.
-Bye, Mr Zhou Chuan.

775
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,950
You saw that, didn't you?

776
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,590
She wanted to draw the line with me.

777
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,870
It's only been one week.

778
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,500
Where has her manners gone?

779
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,390
I should've recorded that

780
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,750
and show it to her.

781
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,660
That is too much.

782
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,630
Also...

783
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,350
Look at me.

784
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,830
What's the use of a leash?

785
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,950
Why didn't you hold me back?

786
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,940
I've actually decided to...

787
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,790
I've already decided to apologise first.

788
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,510
Is that your sister?

789
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,110
It's you?

790
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,390
Where's Chu Li?

791
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,870
You screwed up?

792
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,590
Didn't I say

793
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,150
to apologise first?

794
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,790
Swallow your pride.

795
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,790
Why won't you learn?

796
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,470
You're one to talk.

797
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,070
Why does she always smile
so happily when she sees you,

798
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,070
and pull a long face when she sees me?

799
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,230
When I think about it,

800
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,070
I can't help but get mad.

801
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:16,830
Hey.

802
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,430
What a jealous guy.

803
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,550
Seriously.

804
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,390
Can't you stop being jealous?

805
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,340
Listen.

806
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,910
I

807
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,550
am the writer Chu Li is working with.

808
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,620
Of course she will be polite to me.

809
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,500
Why would she treat you the same way?

810
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,510
If she does,

811
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,700
then you should really be mad.

812
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,020
Think about that.

813
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,630
What should I do now?

814
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,910
I actually planned to have a meal here

815
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,550
if Chu Li is in.

816
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,140
Seems like I'd better leave.

817
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,830
I'll place a delivery order.

818
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,510
Pick what you want.

819
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,940
Such kindness.

820
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,150
What do you want?

821
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,190
Update me on what Chu Li is doing anytime.

822
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,550
Since she's always nice to you.

823
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,150
I want the most pricey
Buddha's Temptation.

824
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,390
1,988 yuan per portion.

825
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,430
That expensive?

826
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,110
What is added to it?

827
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,270
Just order it.

828
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,630
Two portions?

829
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,670
One, for yourself.

830
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,270
I'm not hungry.
