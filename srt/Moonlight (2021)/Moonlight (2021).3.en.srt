00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,070
The contract, sir!

5
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,910
What contract?

6
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,990
I thought you've signed and
sealed the contract.

7
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,190
I didn't say that.

8
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,070
I can't find the seal.

9
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,350
So, I'm asking for your help

10
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,910
and clean up my room while at it.

11
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,470
Clean up?

12
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,710
Mr Zhou.

13
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,150
You want me to look for the seal

14
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,100
or to clean up your room?

15
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,950
To look for the seal, of course.

16
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,790
But you have to clean up to find it.

17
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,850

22
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,270
I mean, are you in a relationship?

23
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,510

You read Madam Cocoon's picture book too?

28
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,920
I will never read a low class

41
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,150

than Xin Dun Books?

47

Yes, he is.

66
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,670

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,430
Don't you know

191
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,350
how to check the power source?

192
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,870
I don't know.

193
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,150
I have a nanny to settle it for me.

194
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,590
This is common sense!

195
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,710
Why are you shouting?

196
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,110
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,220
I have to leave for my errands.

198
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,710
Wait.

199
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,230
Now that you're here,

200
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,550
you can continue cleaning up

201
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,680
the remaining mess.

202
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,390
Since that you have a lot of free time.

203
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,070
I'm not! I'm really busy!

204
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,430
I've only slept for three hours
from yesterday.

205
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,270
I was tidying up the shelves yesterday,

206
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,510
but you tricked me here

207
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,510
and made me late.

208
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,190
Ms Yu scolded me so badly.

209
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,910
I was thinking to work hard today,

210
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,750
but something happened to Mr Miao.

211
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,110
I had to rush my way to send him a laptop.

212
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,470
I was able to get some rest

213
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,750
and take a peek at my idol.

214
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,420
But I'm here for a washing machine!

215
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,550
A washing machine!

216
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,030
You must use electric for it!

217
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,790
Don't you know?

218
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,590
You...

219
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,430
Are you thirsty?

220
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,460
Do you want a drink?

221
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm not thirsty.

222
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,230
Mr Zhou Chuan.

223
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,830
I was in a wrong mood.

224
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,550
I'm not saying that I'm not cleaning up.

225
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,550
I'm just too tired to do it.

226
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,350
If you don't mind,

227
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,340
I'll clean up your house tomorrow.

228
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,710
See you tomorrow!

229
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,270
Scared me to death.

[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

231
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,430
This time,

232
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,710
I must give Xiao Niao an appraisal.

233
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,070
If she didn't

234
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,190
make a good presentation

235
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,710
and obtain Mr Jiang's trust,

236
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,510
I'm afraid

237
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,230
we won't even get a chance to meet.

238
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,350
It's nothing.

239
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,670
It's my duty.

What's your progress with Mr Zhou Chuan?

242
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,910
That's a huge progress.

243
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,630
She went from looking for the seal

244
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,150
to applying for a new seal.

245
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,630

[No.]

Mr Jiang.

273
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,790
From the moment I read you book titled

274
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,830
The Disappearing Zoo,

275
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,700
I made a goal for myself.

276
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,460
If I have the chance,

277
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,660
I'll definitely film this into a movie.

278
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,760
Didn't I obtain the chance now?

279
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,350
Actually, plenty of people had

280
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,580
reached out to Mr Jiang

281
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,110
for his book's copyright.

282
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,430
He didn't say yes to anyone.

283
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,710
But he said yes

284
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,150
when he heard it was you.

285
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,870
Mr Jiang is your fan.

286
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,820
Which films do you like?

287
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,670
Besides Yesterday,

288
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,650
I like No Man's Land and Straw.

289
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,430
These are my earliest works.

290
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,790
You saw every film

291
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,750
I directed?

292
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,870
I was sure that

293
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,310
you'll come along.

294
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,950
My sentiments exactly when I
read the Disappearing Zoo

295
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,270
for the first time.

296
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,150
A toast to you.

297
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,310
Here! Our collaboration

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,110
this time will be a pleasant one.

299
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,230
That's a must!

300
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,990
I remember I told you

301
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,320
that I'm not selling it.

302
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,990
You're too late.

303
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,080
From the moment you accepted
the invitation,

304
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,750
the copyright was sold.

305
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,990
Didn't you admire him?

306
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,630
I admire his work.

307
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,150
But that doesn't mean
I admire his personality

308
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,670
or that I'll work with him.

309
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,869
Are you going to offend Li Yu?

310
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,420
He's Li Yu.

311
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,310
If you offend him,

312
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,630
no one will dare to film your work
into movies.

313
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,390
Do you believe it or not?

314
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,869
What are you trying to do?

315
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,830
What am I trying to do?

316
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,030
I'm pulling you away
from the rusty publishing house.

317
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,630
I'm helping you to start anew.

318
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,190
You were the one
who made me into such a mess.

319
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,970
Don't you feel guilty to speak with me

320
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,170
in such a rightful manner?

321
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,750
Gu Bai Zhi doesn't know about guilt

322
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,350
in her life yet.

323
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,870
Let's stop for a while.

324
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,430
What's wrong? Who made you angry?

325
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,310
You.

326
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,630
Me?

327
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,620
I was busy with Yuan Yue Publishing House

328
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,030
that I didn't make time for you.

329
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,260
What's wrong?

330
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,660
You're joining Yuan Yue Publishing House?

331
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,670
Hello?

332
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,540
Hello, Mr Jiang.

333
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,390
I'm Miao.

334
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,740
I'm calling

335
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,430
to ask about

336
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,190
the contract with us.

337
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,520
What are your thoughts?

338
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,220
After your presentation,

339
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,270
I pondered for a while.

340
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,350
[I think we're not on the same path.]

341
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,230
I think we can wait for

342
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,090
another chance to work together.

343
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,950
I'll hang up as I'm occupied.

344
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,670
Hello? Hello? Hello?

345
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,510
What is it?

346
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,950
Jiang Yu Cheng refused to work with us.

347
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,990
Why?

348
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,510
You refused?

349
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,630
Why?

350
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,830
The deputy editor and editor
tried to brainwash me

351
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,560
into writing fantasy and
immortal cultivation.

352
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,430
Miao is capable to do this.

353
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,590
He thinks about the market
and the top hits,

354
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,990
but not the authors.

355
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,030
Miao.

356
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,860
Is Jiang Yu Cheng's Weibo

357
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,320
related to your meeting with
him yesterday?

358
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,750
I know.

359
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,390
The readers were saying that his new work

360
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,670
is controversial.

361
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,950
He was unhappy?

362
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,350
I reminded you.

363
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,230
Famous young authors like Jiang Yu Cheng

364
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,790
are difficult to handle.

365
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,630
Do you think the arrogance of a author

366
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,670
only appears in fictional works?

367
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,150
It was all my fault.

368
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,830
I followed the PowerPoint presentation

369
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,110
and spoke directly.

370
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,480
You didn't make the slides?

371
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,870
Not entirely.

372
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,830
Not entirely?

373
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,470
Chu Li.

374
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,210
Did you work on the slides?

375
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,030
It's not entirely Chu Li's fault.

376
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,630
I thought Chu Li will understand
Jiang Yu Cheng better

377
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,950
as she is his loyal reader.

378
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,630
So I asked her to amend it for me.

379
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,890
But I never thought...

380
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,710
Yes.

381
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,110
But I don't think Mr Jiang

382
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,590
is such a narrow-minded man.

383
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,910
He'll never get mad with
such trivial matters.

384
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,510
Do you think you know Jiang Yu Cheng?

385
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,430
This is great.

386
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,830
You failed to sign Zhou Chuan,

387
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,950
and Xiao Niao failed to

388
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,810
get Jiang Yu Cheng because of you!

389
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,310
No.

390
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,910
How can you put the blame on me?

391
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,670
I admit that I made the slides.

392
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,390
But you agreed to the content

393
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,830
and went with the meeting.

394
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,100
Why...

395
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,350
Stop fighting!

396
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,430
Think of a way to

397
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,470
salvage this.

398
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,870
All of you are really

399
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,110
unprofessional beyond my expectation.

400
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,430
We'll look at the contracts.

401
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,350
If you can't get it,

402
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,630
none of you will stay.

403
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,470
I have an old reader

404
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,630
working at Yuan Yue.

405
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,070
I thought she'll come

406
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,270
when I saw the slides.

407
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,630
What old reader?

408
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,310
She's at Yuan Yue?

409
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,240
What's her name?

410
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,110
I didn't hear about her from you.

411
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,510
When did you feel interested

412
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,190
at my reader?

413
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,870
Who's interested in her?

414
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,150
I have higher quality readers than you.

415
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,910
Who would care about your readers?

416
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,240
Ugly and ill-tempered.

417
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,350
What a joke.

418
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,790
Hello, Mr Xia.

419
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,590
How many times did I tell you?

420
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,390
An author must have passion

421
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,620
for his work.

422
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,700
Hence, a masterpiece will be made.

423
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,550
As editors,

424
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,710
we must never try

425
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,430
to control them.

426
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,390
No.

427
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,030
Mr Xia, I...

428
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,430
I'm not controlling him.

429
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,800
You're not controlling Jiang Yu Cheng
by asking him to write

430
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,990
about fantasy and immortal cultivation?

431
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,470
Fantasy and immortal cultivation?

432
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,150
Mr Jiang's expertise is suspense
and thriller.

433
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,670
Miao.

434
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,990
You didn't tell me about asking

435
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,950
Jiang Yu Cheng to switch genres.

436
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,670
The reason I did it

437
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,590
is because...

438
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,110
I hope that Mr Jiang can have
a change in his preference.

439
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,830
After all,

440
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,020
fantasy and cultivation

441
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,950
is the most popular genre in the market.

442
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,830
I did it for his own good.

443
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,350
Have you considered about

444
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,390
his feelings?

445
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,790
Will he like it?

446
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,310
This time,

447
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,430
if I didn't

448
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,980
contact Jiang Yu Cheng on my own,

449
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,990
I'll still be in the dark until now.

450
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,030
I'm reminding all of you.

451
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,630
As an editor,

452
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,430
we must respect the authors.

453
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,750
I don't wish to see this

454
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,300
happen again.

455
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,550
Understand?

456
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,390
Yes.

457
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,030
Xiang, thank you

458
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,470
for tidying up the place with me.

459
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,950
You're welcome.

460
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,670
I wish everyone in the office

461
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,350
can be as kind as you.

462
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,180
I'm not expecting them to be so kind.

463
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,470
But they should at least be fair.

464
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,750
They shouldn't push the blame on me.

465
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,710
Chu Li.

466
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,980
I think you should keep a low profile
from now on.

467
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,910
If you offend Deputy Editor,

468
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,940
you'll have a hard time.

469
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,550
Someone has his back.

470
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,670
Who?

471
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,630
Have some sweets.

472
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,230
No, I don't.

473
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,670
Take it.

474
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,630
No, I have glycosuria.

475
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,560
Eat it yourself.

476
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,870
Mr Liang?

477
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,100
Rumours said

478
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,230
that Mr Xia is retiring.

479
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,470
The position of the Vice President

480
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,830
will be chosen between Mr Liang and Ms Yu.

481
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,150
But Mr Yang had already decided

482
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,070
to put Mr Liang on the seat.

483
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,390
Didn't you see?

484
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,830
Mr Liang is beginning

485
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,150
to take over other departments.

486
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,190
[Zui Qian Yu Winehouse]

487
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,070
Miao.

488
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,430
How many years have we met?

489
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,750
It's been five years.

490
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,870
Five years.

491
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,990
Where were you five years before?

492
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,390
I was at the circulation department
as a promoter.

493
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,590
I ran around in various bookstores
regardless of the weather.

494
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,590
Bookstores back then had a hard time.

495
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,030
Unlike the modern ones now

496
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,790
that sells creative works and coffee.

497
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,830
Every day when the sun comes up,

498
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,710
those old trademarks

499
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,070
would fall like dominos.

500
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,630
Mr Liang.

501
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,820
This is actually my greatest concern.

502
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,020
I'm worried that

503
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,390
Yuan Yue Publishing House
will share the same fate

504
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,610
if we don't change our module.

505
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,950
Yuan Yue Publishing House is not stubborn,

506
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,720
but the manager of
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

507
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,570
You know the person I'm directing at.

508
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,080
I knew right away without
your hint, Mr Liang.

509
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,030
That's right.

510
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,310
Yuan Yue Publishing House had promoted

511
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,270
some famous authors.

512
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,630
But look at where we are.

513
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,910
We're getting beaten by

514
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,470
huge companies like Xin Dun Books.

515
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,470
And we don't stand a chance.

516
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,580
This is the market discipline.

517
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,710
Passion? Who doesn't have passion?

518
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,660
Yuan Yue Publishing House will be gone.

519
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,390
Where will the passion be?

520
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,390
Right?

521
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,430
They're making a fuss over nothing.

522
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,910
They're acting coy.

523
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,870
I won't joke with you.

524
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,270
Here's an inside news.

525
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,670
Mr Yang gave his word.

526
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,110
When Mr Xia retires,

527
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,300
Yuan Yue Publishing House
will be under my command.

528
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,030
You mean...

529
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,820
Don't you understand?

530
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,630
Don't act silly here.

531
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,030
Miao.

532
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,790
I know about your personality.

533
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,830
And I know about your capability.

534
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,590
So from now on,

535
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,390
the editorial department depends on you.

536
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,780
Guard it well.

537
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,510
You'll be my right-hand man in the future.

538
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,240
Understand?

539
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,630
Yes! I'll give you a toast.

540
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,590
Stop it.

541
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,590
Here's another inside scope.

542
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,390
Sure.

543
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,830
Yue Dong Games is interested
to obtain the animation

544
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,950
and gaming copyright of

545
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,990
the Oriental Beauty.

546
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,910
Their boss loves the book.

547
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,910
Mr Zhang from Yue Dong?

548
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,610
He's the pioneer of the gaming industry.

549
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,550
You know Mr Zhang's ability.

550
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,190
Everything that he has his eyes
on will be popular.

551
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,710
Zhou Chuan will be extremely valuable.

552
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,580
Place the rest of authors aside.

553
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,150
Do you best to get Zhou Chuan

554
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,350
into our company, understand?

555
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,740
You must take him down personally.

556
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,870
Understand?

557
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,190
Chu Li.

558
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,340
Give me a copy of Zhou Chuan's contract.

559
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,630
Mr Zhou Chuan's contract is with him.

560
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,030
He said he'll give it to me
after he seals it.

561
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,480
Fine, then print me another copy.

562
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,190
Deputy Editor.

563
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,320
May I know why do you need the contract?

564
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,310
From today onwards,

565
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,830
Zhou Chuan is off your hands.

566
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,950
I'll take over.

567
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,630
Off my hands?

568
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,670
Why?

569
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,460
Don't ask why.

570
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,950
Never mind.

571
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,430
I'll do it myself.

572
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,950
If he's taking me away from
Zhou Chuan's case,

573
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,480
does he want me to leave
the publishing house?

574
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,030
Chu Li.

575
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,670
How about this?

576
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,630
Call Mr Zhou Chuan

577
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,630
in front of Deputy Editor Miao

578
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,550
to confirm his decision.

579
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,030
[Sorry, the number you have dialled...]

580
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,920
Xiang, I'm going to Mr Zhou Chuan's house.

581
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,820
What's that face?

582
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,910
Mr Zhou.

583
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,110
I didn't see you for a day.

584
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,190
You've exerted yourself
like this for work?

585
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,310
Did your flu get worse?

586
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,790
What do you think?

587
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,910
The thing is, Mr Zhou Chuan...

588
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,750
I have an presumptuous request.

589
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,580
Can you please...

590
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,670
Drink hot water if you caught a cold!

591
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,750
How are you?

592
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,070
I'm fine.

593
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,110
I'll help you.

594
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,990
Careful.

595
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,550
Do you have a thermometer?

596
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,110
I don't know.

597
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,590
Leave if there's no urgency.

598
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,790
Don't disturb me.

599
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,870
Xiao Niao.

600
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,220
Where is she?

601
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,270
She went to Mr Zhou Chuan's house.

602
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,910
No, that's because...

603
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,430
No?

604
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,170
Do you have to cover up for her?

605
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,950
Didn't I tell her

606
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,420
that I'll be in charge of Zhou Chuan?

607
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,950
Is she really a dimwit?

608
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,990
It's related to the internship result.

609
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,850
It's common for her to be nervous.

610
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,270
Why didn't you leave?

611
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,950
No! I want to sleep!

612
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,290
Place the thermometer under the tongue.

613
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,660
Thirty eight degrees?

614
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,430
Have some porridge and flu medicine.

615
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,670
You must visit the hospital

616
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,600
if you feel unwell tomorrow, okay?

617
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,190
There's no meat.

618
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,190
How unpalatable.

619
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,790
There's meat below.

620
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,790
I made this beef porridge for you.

621
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,670
You made it?

622
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,470
Then?

623
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,270
Did I procure it with magic?

624
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,570
I have no strength to drink it.

625
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,990
Brother.

626
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,390
Do you want me to feed you?

627
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,590
It's fine.

628
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,060
I can fall sick until I die.

629
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,790
Didn't I ask you to leave?

630
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,940
Am I such a person who will abandon

631
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,260
a sick and lonely man behind?

632
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,430
Don't you hate me?

633
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,070
You're overthinking.

634
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,150
How would I hate you?

635
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,430
I can't wait to hold you like
a treasure in my hands.

636
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,410
I'm not eating.

637
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,830
You have to eat!

638
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,790
I don't eat food from people I dislike.

639
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,110
Who told you that I hate you?

640
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,030
No one told me.

641
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,270
I can see it myself.

642
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,710
You even threw tantrums.

643
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,710
It's just a temporary
mental breakdown from adults.

644
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,310
Fine.

645
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,550
I did hate you before.

646
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,150
But I don't hate you anymore.

647
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,670
Why?

648
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,750
That's because you're
eating the porridge obediently.

649
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,750
Drink this.

650
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,110
Mr Zhou Chuan.

651
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,670
Can you please help me tomorrow...

652
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:24,110
How great it'll be
if you're this obedient.

653
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,190
Come in.

654
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,989
Chief Editor.

655
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,310
Chu Li can't do this.

656
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,270
How did she offend you again?

657
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,190
She didn't offend me.

658
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,750
I think her capability

659
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,830
and working attitude are problematic.

660
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,949
Look.

661
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,380
She always leave the office

662
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,469
without a reason.

663
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,550
Then,

664
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,150
she'll try to defy her leaders.

665
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,030
She didn't contribute
to the publishing house at all.

666
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,420
I think

667
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,219
she's not suitable to work here.

668
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,190
You mean...

669
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,550
I mean

670
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,480
we should end her probation early.

671
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,740
That's going against the regulations.

672
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,600
There's no regulations about it.

673
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,140
Look, Chief Editor.

674
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,350
The current situation of

675
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,670
our office is obvious.

676
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,100
We can't afford to employ useless people.

677
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,670
You gave her time

678
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,990
to sign Zhou Chuan with us.

679
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,110
But I think

680
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,750
she'll never get it done

681
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,430
no matter how much time you give her.

682
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,550
If that's so,

683
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,420
I'd rather we place our concentration

684
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,790
entirely on Xiao Niao instead.

685
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,700
Even though she didn't get to
sign Jiang Yu Cheng,

686
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,460
but

687
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,340
Mr He Ma had signed under us.

688
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,030
He agreed to publish his works

689
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,180
through our publishing house.

690
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,640
She had already exceeded our expectations.

691
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,030
Fine, we'll do as you say.

692
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,830
I'm on it!

693
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,790
Miao.

694
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,230
I wonder who taught her to

695
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,560
go against her leaders.

696
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,430
You're right.

697
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,190
Take your temperature, Mr Zhou.

698
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,590
You're fine if it's 37 degrees.

699
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,070
There's porridge in the pot.

700
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,500
Microwave it for two minutes
before consumption.

701
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,300
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

702
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,500
We will come to

703
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,710
a decision on Xiao Niao and Chu Li's
stay or departure

704
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,270
in our meeting today.

705
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,790
The both of them weren't allowed to stay

706
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,650
because they failed their tasks.

707
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,590
But Xiao Niao

708
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,590
was able to contact Mr He Ma

709
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,190
and obtained his copyrights

710
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,350
for the next five years.

711
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,590
So, Xiao Niao gets to stay.

712
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,550
Chu Li.

713
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,750
You might not

714
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,230
be suitable as an editor.

715
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,470
Your probation will end now.

716
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,550
Chief Editor Yu.

717
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,310
I can call Mr Zhou Chuan

718
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,310
to prove that he's willing to join us.

719
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,870
I can complete my task.

720
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,630
Sure, you may call him.

721
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,510
Can you give me an hour?

722
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,070
I'll visit him.

723
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,430
I don't think it's necessary.

724
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,270
You can't even reach

725
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,930
Zhou Chuan's house in an hour.

726
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,070
Chief Editor Yu.

727
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,430
Do you believe Zhou Chuan

728
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,950
lost his seal for the contract?

729
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,810
Isn't there plenty of authors
who behaved like him?

730
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,590
Therefore, Chu Li.

731
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,860
Don't waste our time.

732
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,940
Can't you pack up your belongings

733
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,310
and just work in any bank you like?

734
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,550
Deputy Editor.

735
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,220
Mr Zhou Chuan is not such a person.

736
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,470
If you're using this

737
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,980
as an excuse to fire me,

738
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,030
I can't accept it.

739
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,710
So what if you can't accept it?

740
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,830
Will Zhou Chuan seal

741
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,830
the contract if you can't accept it?

742
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,800
I hope I didn't disturb you.

743
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,350
Mr Zhou Chuan?

744
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,070
I've signed the contract.

745
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,790
If there's anything

746
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,990
to discuss in the future,

747
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,870
Chu Li can contact me directly.

748
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,150
Sure.

749
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,230
Thank you for visiting us, Mr Zhou Chuan.

750
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,420
I'll take my leave.

What?

818
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,550
There's no direct object in the sentence.

819
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,190
You should add the word "function"
after the word "prevention".

820
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,740
It's not that strict now.

821

You two are still concerned about
the decadence

825
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,230

Who cares about him?

829
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,270
I'll have no appetite with him around.

830
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,790
Then you shouldn't eat.

831
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,270
You can curb your Three Highs.

832
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,670
You're too rude to your father,
Xiao Chuan.

833
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,990
That's it. It's my treat today.

834
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,710

836
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,870

837
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,550
Hungry?

838
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,470
Let's eat.

839
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,180
Sure.

840
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,270
The braised meat here

841
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,170
tastes authentic.

842
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,590
Dad.

843
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,990
I think

844
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,990
you shouldn't eat the braised meat.

845
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,510
You have Three Highs too.

846
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,580
Look, he's even stricter than his mother.

847
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,990
Alright then.

848
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,580
Uncle Zhou.

849
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,030
Their fish is exceptionally fresh.

850
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,760
Have a taste.

851
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,350
Zhou Chuan.

852
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,860
Get Uncle Zhou some fish.

853
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,430
I'm not used to serve food to others.

854
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,110
Others? Who's the others?

855
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,510
I'm your father!

856
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,680
When did you ever carry out
your duty as a father?

857
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,910
Look at him! Look at him!

858
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,790
He's already so arrogant now that

859
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,710
he accomplished nothing!

860
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,830
Old Zhou.

861
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,110
Your words might be too harsh.

862
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,300
From what I know,

863
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,380
Little Zhou's works are being prepared

864
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,070

865
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:30,900
Am I right?

866
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,830
Yes.

867
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,300
The aesthetics nowadays
are really crooked.

868
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,350
Those who are on trend

869
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,550

if they're at the tertiary level.

870
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,470
I think you're jealous of me.

871
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,790
Just by your level of expertise,

872
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,450
are you worthy of my jealousy?

873
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,670
I want to see

874
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,110

875
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,510
if anyone will be interested
in your works.

876
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,070
I'm done eating.

877
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,190
Stop right there!

878
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,550

879
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,190

880
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,700

881
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,510
