[Episode 16]

00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,150
Chu Li.

5
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,630
Are these books for Mr Zhou Chuan

6
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,420
to sign?

7
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,470
May I have one?

8
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,870
I was notified today that

9
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,870
the official release date of
Book of Luo He God has been

10
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,110
scheduled for next month's book fair

11
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,110
after online and offline pre-orders.

12
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,500
You may queue up first.

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,350
Because the first 50 persons can get

14
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,150
Mr Zhou Chuan's signature.

15
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,190
First come, first served.

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,520
Maybe you can be
the first person to get it.

17
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,550
You're merciless indeed.

18
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,270
Are you going to send these to

19
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,150
Mr Zhou Chuan for him to sign?

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,710
Let me think about it.

21
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,180
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

22
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,910
Could you please come over to
the editorial department

23
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,870
for a while to lend a hand?

24
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,070
[Did Yuan Yue Publishing House
not exploit you enough?]

25
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,930
[You even asked for foreign aid.]

26
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,070
[I'm busy.]

27
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,710
Actually I'm, asking you to sign 50 books
for your fans.

28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,470
Hello there.

29
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,350
Hello.

30
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,860
Are you still on the phone?

31
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,940
[I'm near to Yuan Yue Publishing House.]

32
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,990
[I'll arrive within five minutes.]

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,190
[I'm hanging up.]

34
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,870
How's it?

35
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,990
Did Mr Zhou Chuan

36
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,630
agree to it right away?

37
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,460
He's The Gentle and Kind Mr Chuan
as always.

38
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,640
Ah Xiang, has Chief Editor Yu arrived yet?

39
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,070
Chief Editor Yu has arrived

40
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,110
early in the morning with Mr Xia.

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,810
They're now in the meeting room
confronting Liang Chong Lang.

42
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,150
Is Mr Xia back?

43
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,550
He's in the meeting room.

44
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,900
Chief Editor Yu, let's not

45
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,270
make any hassles.

46
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,980
Look, the book fair will be

47
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,070
organised next month.

48
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,790
I'm busy enough.

49
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,650
Let's not mention Suo Heng again
in our meeting.

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,510
She's neither famous nor talented.

51
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,310
Even if you give her one more chance,

52
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,710
would there be a miracle?

53
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,350
Suo Heng has

54
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,820
long been sick before.

55
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,140
As everyone knows,

56
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,630
she often suffers relapses recently.

57
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,270
It'll affect her in writing
to some extent.

58
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,750
But she has a good attitude.

59
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,590
Over the years,

60
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,700
she's always the first author
to submit the drafts.

61
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,899
You're right.

62
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,269
Suo Heng

63
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,750
has always been the first
to submit the drafts.

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,830
It's speedy, right?

65
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,470
My nephew

66
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,950
has always been

67
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,750
the first to submit the essays

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,780
and yet

69
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,070
receive failing grades.

70
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,390
Does it help?

71
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,150
Chief Editor Yu,

72
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,710
we don't demand speed.

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,510
It doesn't matter.

74
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,630
We demand quality

75
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,030
and sales.

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,590
Am I right?

77
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,909
And didn't you say that

78
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,870
Suo Heng is sick?

79
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,630
She needs to be cured.

80
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,670
You even asked a patient to work.

81
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,909
That's inhumane.

82
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,390
Mr Liang.

83
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,470
All right.

84
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,870
Yu Yao

85
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,590
looked for me overnight

86
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,820
and told me precisely about Suo Heng.

87
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,870
That's why

88
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,660
I came back this early.

89
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,710
Liang.

90
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,310
I've requested Director Yang

91
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,470
to give Suo Heng one more chance.

92
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,190
Even talented authors

93
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,430
will hit a plateau.

94
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,710
Jiang Yu Cheng

95
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,430
is one among them.

96
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,750
His current works are more excellent

97
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,950
than previous works.

98
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,110
Yuan Yue Publishing House

99
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,670
never

100
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,870
kick the authors

101
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,950
when they're down.

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,830
Mr Xia.

103
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,060
We didn't kick her.

104
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,110
She's already down.

105
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,390
Then let us

106
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,670
help her get up.

107
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,550
What's more,

108
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,350
our editors

109
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,150
are responsible for Suo Heng's situation.

110
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,110
Before this,

111
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,590
the chief editor and deputy editor

112
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,150
used to be her editor.

113
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,750
But there's no improvement.

114
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,710
Even if you gave her another chance,

115
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,700
who would like to be the editor?

116
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,990
I'd like to be her editor.

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,970
[Zhou Chuan]

118
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,430
Mr Zhou Chuan.

119
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,030
Chu Li is occupied now.

120
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,190
She'll be back soon.

121
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,350
Okay.

122
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,110
Was the release date of Book of Luo He God

123
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,710
scheduled for next month
during the book fair?

124
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,560
Yes, it's just been confirmed.

125
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,190
Are 50 signed books enough?

126
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,280
Should I sign 100 books?

127
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,750
Wouldn't you be tired

128
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,740
if you sign 100 books?

129
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,430
It's fine. As long as my fans are happy.

130
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,950
I won't feel tired at all.

131
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,870
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

132
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,270
Don't worry, Mr Zhou Chuan.

133
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,350
On that day,

134
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,600
I will be the first to queue up

135
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,190
and get your signed book.

136
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,660
I'll be rooting for you.

137
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,970
[To: Ah Xiang]

138
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,750
Now you're the first one.

139
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,710
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

140
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,500
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

141
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,590
Well, Ah Xiang.

142
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,950
Did Chu Li

143
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,030
act strangely lately?

144
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,430
Chu Li

145
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,510
acts as normal.

146
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,510
Didn't she

147
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,470
suspect one's identity?

148
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,590
No, everything's fine.

149
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,150
How about Jiang Yu Cheng?

150
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,150
Did he come here often recently?

151
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,909
Well, Mr Jiang. No.

152
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,570
He didn't come here recently.

153
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,230
Ah Xiang.

154
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,430
You are Chu Li's bestie.

155
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,270
You must always remind her that

156
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,150
be more attentive to her author.

157
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,150
I'm the one who means the most to her.

158
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,670
Don't be attentive to unrelated persons.

159
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,870
It's not worthy.

160
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,150
I got this.

161
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,540
Rest assured, Mr Zhou Chuan.

162
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,740
I'll advise Chu Li surely.

163
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,750
Girls should focus on own career.

164
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,190
Right?

165
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,910
Focus on own career.

166
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,870
Don't talk yet.

167
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,669
What's with the excitement?

168
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,630
Mr Xia.

169
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,860
As I know Director Yang well,

170
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,990
there must be additional conditions.

171
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,950
Moonlight Magazine must sign
a publishing contract

172
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,810
for Zhou Chuan's upcoming novel.

173
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,990
If Suo Heng's

174
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,150
instalment

175
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,180
don't get a good response,

176
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,280
the contract would be terminated.

177
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,350
Did you hear that?

178
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,870
Can you make it?

179
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,630
Do you still want to be the editor?

180
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,300
If you've pledged,

181
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,030
you must be responsible
for the consequences.

182
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,030
Think carefully.

183
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,110
I thought of it carefully.

184
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,460
I'd like to give it a try.

185
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,430
Give it a try?

186
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,070
I'll do my best surely.

187
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,830
Chu Li.

188
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,670
Are you confident?

189
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,790
Yes, as long as Ms Suo Heng
is confident in herself.

190
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,950
Okay.

191
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,190
Go ahead then.

192
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,620
Thank you for your trust.

193
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,710
And

194
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,790
Director Yang also decided to

195
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,990
make the blank column of
Moonlight Magazine

196
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,950
into Animation Column.

197
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,870
Animation Column?

198
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,310
It doesn't suit Moonlight Magazine.

199
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,780
It's so odd.

200
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,590
I don't think it's
Director Yang's idea.

201
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,470
It's your idea, right?

202
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,750
Yes, it's my idea.

203
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,830
What's wrong?

204
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,390
Chief Editor Yu, don't you think about it?

205
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,350
Why didn't Director Yang

206
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,510
approve any of your ideas

207
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,590
but mine?

208
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,590
The reason is simple.

209
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,030
All my ideas are for the sake of

210
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,740
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

211
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,350
I have a clear conscience.

212
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,630
If you want to help Suo Heng,

213
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,890
follow the rules then.

214
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,430
All right.

215
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,830
As Director Yang said so,

216
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,830
let's do it then.

217
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,940
That's all for Suo Heng's matter.

218
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,460
Chu Li.

219
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,660
Guide Suo Heng well.

220
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,590
I've been an editor for years.

221
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,070
I'll give you an advice.

222
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,920
Keep your promise, don't let others down.

223
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,680
That's how your life works.

224
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,830
I got it.

225
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,390
You've off work.

226
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,430
What are you writing?

227
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,070
Mr Xia agreed that
I'm in charge of Suo Heng.

228
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,400
Did Suo Heng agree to it?

229
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,390
So, I'm now thinking about

230
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,110
how to cheer her up.

231
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,190
How about me?

232
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,750
What?

233
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,710
Someone used to beg me

234
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,500
to be my exclusive editor.

235
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,990
And yet now

236
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,790
mother duck has two more ducklings
to take care of.

237
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,630
I didn't mention I'm the exclusive editor.

238
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,710
Did you just say that you're a duckling?

239
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,700
What's in your mind

240
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,550
exactly?

241
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,230
It's not the way home.

242
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,230
Where are you going to bring me to

243
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,020
on this bright day?

244
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,870
Grip the racket like this.

245
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,990
When you see the ball,

246
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,230
swing the racket.

247
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,590
Do you get it?

248
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,900
♫ What time is it?
You are still sleeping? ♫

249
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,830
You're making it difficult for me.

250
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,480
♫ Chopping wood, keeping a dog, working ♫

251
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,150
Are you taking revenge on me?

252
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,300
It's for the sake of writing.

253
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,520
♫ Where did I stop yesterday? ♫

254
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,510
I need a girl with zero experience

255
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,840
to practise the skills.

256
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,170
♫ I can replay my feelings ♫

257
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,900
Is Huang Quan Inn a novel about sports?

258
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,800
♫ Daydreaming in the dark of night ♫

259
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,630
Look at the ball.

260
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,470
Do like this.

261
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,180
Swing it. You got it?

262
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,050
♫ Chasing after you beyond the universe ♫

263
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,030
It's easier said than done.

264

♫ Be a darling in the gorgeous castle ♫

265

♫ We have a date online and offline ♫

270
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,260
Swing it like this.

271
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,630
One, two, three. Go.

272
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,110

♫ Ding ding ding, my cutie is calling ♫

276
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,830
I told you to aim the target.

♫ I simply treat you as the role model ♫

278
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,350

♫ Ding ding ding, my cutie is calling ♫

280
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,330
♫ I fell in love with a mischief-maker ♫

281
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,230
Now I started to know the fun of
playing squash.

282
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,710
Although both my arms are sore,

283
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,790
I feel amazingly good.

284
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,550
Of course you are.

285
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,790
No one dares to hit my face

286
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,710
except Jiang Yu Cheng

287
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,260
and you.

288
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,220
Mr Zhou Chuan.

289
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,830
You're good at writing

290
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,550
and also playing squash.

291
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,670
How could you

292
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,750
be good at everything you learnt?

293

♫ Those long nights I have ♫

296
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,070
Attention and persistence.

297

A strong-willed person

298
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,630
will succeed in everything.

and be down sometimes.

302
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,060
But you won't

I forgot that I have a dinner date
with Mr Jiang.

We're going to watch the finale together.

331

I'll go on behalf of you.

332

It's fine.

337
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,790
I've met him.

338
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,030
Go ahead. Bye.

339
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,950
If you want to discuss the finale,
look for me then.

340
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,750
Why did you ask a monkey out?

341
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,540
Are you on purpose?

342
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,350
You're the one who's on purpose.

343
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,790
Discuss the finale?

344
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,830
You're actually asking a girl out

345
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,230
to dinner and the cinema.

346
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,110
I know she rejected you.

347
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,510
Don't struggle anymore.

348
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,350
How would I

349
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,670
show you my finale?

350
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,150
But I lack inspiration

351
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,470
for some parts.

352
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,200
Are you going to follow me
the whole night?

353
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,310
Do you want to meet the monkey without me?

354
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,590
No matter what you do,

355
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,390
I'll follow you the whole night.

356
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,550
Why should I ride this with you?

357
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,580
Don't interrupt.

358
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,470
You just said

359
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,870
Chu Li suspects that you're Mr Fox.

360
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,190
But you insisted

361
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,550
and denied.

362
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,710
Three years ago,

363
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,070
since I first knew her online,

364
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,790
I made up my mind

365
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,150
never to

366
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,110
meet online friends.

367
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,020
You dare not to admit, do you?

368
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,310
She must have known your dark past.

369
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,630
Why would I have dark past?

370
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,070
I'm so innocent throughout my life.

371
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,130
Even every strand of my hair is white.

372
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,580
Even if I don't have hair, it's white.

373
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,910
If you ever laugh again,

374
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,000
I'd beat you up in a sack.

375
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,350
Hey, buddy.

376
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,740
Watch your mouth.

377
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,190
Don't you see

378
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,270
there are kids

379
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,950
all around us?

380
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,150
Kiddy.

381
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,510
Listen to me.

382
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,110
Never fight when you grow up.

383
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,670
You'll either be sent to jail
or the hospital.

384
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,670
Never ever fight.

385
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,790
Zhou Chuan.

386
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,390
I want to ask

387
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,900
whom you regard Chu Li as.

388
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,550
As mine.

389
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,390
Are you asking why

390
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,270
I denied that I'm Mr Fox?

391
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,550
I'm not afraid actually.

392
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,750
I think that

393
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,790
since I know her in person,

394
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,550
it doesn't matter if

395
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,830
she knows Mr Fox is me.

396
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,040
You didn't answer my question.

397
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,860
I'm asking for you,

398
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,470
Chu Li is

399
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,230
either your editor or online friend

400
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,710
or the girl you adore.

401
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,270
For me...

402
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,630
Why should I tell you?

403
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,070
Alright then.

404
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,750
I'm going to woo Chu Li.

405
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,990
You don't have any objection, right?

406
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,470
I do have.

407
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,870
I mean

408
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,670
she's so naive.

409
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,070
What if she got cheated by you

410
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,630
and I couldn't

411
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,870
contact her anyhow?

412
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,550
She'd be broken-hearted

413
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,470
and return to her hometown.

414
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,670
What should I do then?

415
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,790
You're always

416
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,030
being so objectionable.

417
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,190
You like something

418
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,670
but you always deny it.

419
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,250
I don't understand what you said.

420
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,069
Have you ever thought that

421
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,390
the person Chu Li likes is

422
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,790
neither you nor me?

423
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,349
Did she get to know someone else?

424
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,829
Why don't I know?

425
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:20,869
It's impossible.

426
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,869
She doesn't have time for that.

427
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,780
Chu Li rejected me because

428
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,980
she likes her online friend,

429
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,390
Mr Fox.

430
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,390
Mr Fox?

431
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,350
Chu Li likes Mr Fox?

432
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,580
Yes.

433
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,190
No way.

434
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,220
All right.

435
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,190
It's better that you don't admit
you're Mr Fox.

436
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,830
Then both of us

437
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,430
are on the same starting point.

438
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,870
Let's do well on our own.

439
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,870
Both of us?

440
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,550
I have to settle something for my store.

441
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,510
I'll get going.

442
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,550
You can continue to ride.

443
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,270
I...

444
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,420
I...

445
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,950
I can't...

446
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,460
Mr Fox?

447
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,470
Why didn't I find out

448
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,950
that she likes Mr Fox?

449
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,110
Didn't I joke about

450
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,990
having an online relationship?

451
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,590
And yet she told me to get out.

452
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,060
She likes someone

453
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,790
but still asked me if I like her.

454
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,790
Can't I have my first love

455
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,870
at 27?

456
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,550
Between Zhou Chuan and Mr Fox,

457
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,870
she chose Mr Fox.

458
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,830
What's wrong with her taste?

459
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,210
[The Disappearing Mr Fox]

460
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,110
[I'm falling for a girl secretly.]

461
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,110
[I'm upset until I couldn't sleep.]

462
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:51,540
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

463
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,150
[You have someone you like?]

464
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,990
Yes, Mr Fox has a girlfriend.

465
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,120
Don't ever think about this
online relationship again.

466
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,710
You're still awake?

467
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,510
I couldn't sleep.

468
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,990
[It seems she knew Mr Fox
is falling in love.]

469
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,450
[She's broken-hearted.]

470
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,680
You seem to have many troubles.

471
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,710
We all

472
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,390
meet troubles in life.

473
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,090
All of them shall pass.

474
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,210
It'd be fine after some while.

475
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,430
I'll go upstairs then.

476
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,510
Good night.

477
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,510
Hello, Mr Jiang.

478
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,270
Sure.

479
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,520
Alright, let's meet tomorrow.

480
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,780
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

481
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,390
[A song that is suitable for]

482
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,720
[someone who is down and couldn't sleep.]

483
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,210
[You'll fall asleep as you listen to it.]

484
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,450
♫ A star must have fallen from the sky ♫

485
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,500
♫ I knew my mind in a sea of people ♫

486
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,120
♫ I forgot how to fly as I want to approach ♫

487
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:58,180
♫ It's a heart-throbbing off-season ♫

488
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:07,140
♫ Where has the paper plane been? ♫

489
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:14,310
♫ The scenery has been ruined
unknowingly ♫

490
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:20,730
♫ I believe you who have the most stories ♫

491
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,660
♫ Are willing to speak your mind to me ♫

492
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,550
Come in.

493
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Chief Editor Yu, please have a look.

494
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,830
After I compared

495
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,830
the readership of some authors,

496
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,790
I realised the readers are mostly women

497
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,750
for authors like Ms Suo Heng

498
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,110
who wrote about ancient strategy.

499
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,630
They are well-educated and older.

500
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,630
And yet they're also loyal readers.

501
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,750
You can get straight to the point.

502
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,150
How about

503
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,990
we organise a small-scale reading salon

504
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,100
for Ms Suo Heng?

505
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,370
Has Mr Zhou Chuan signed the contract
for his novel?

506
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,350
I'll try to settle Suo Heng's matter.

507
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,580
What's more important is

508
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,510
for Mr Zhou Chuan to sign the contract
for his upcoming novel.

509
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,430
Chief Editor Yu, I'll ensure Mr Zhou Chuan

510
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,420
signs the contract for his upcoming novel.

511
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,110
But I think it's more important

512
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,820
to help people now.

513
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,350
It's fine if Ms Suo Heng
doesn't write anymore

514
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,710
and not be our author.

515
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,310
But I can't let her

516
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,550
be discouraged

517
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,180
and hopeless in life.

518
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,030
Chief Editor Yu, I saw Ms Suo Heng

519
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,590
working in a restaurant yesterday.

520
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,870
Ms Suo Heng.

521
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,750
Did you get better today?

522
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,870
Can we meet

523
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,870
when you're free?

524
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,460
Chu Li.

525
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,270
Mr Jiang.

526
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,590
I watched the finale

527
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,670
you sent to me.

528
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,150
It's awesome.

529
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,270
I'm saying this again.

530
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,750
This book will mark your new peak indeed.

531
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,670
Thank you.

532
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,430
This meal is on me.

533
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,550
We didn't get to

534
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,950
have a good meal because of Zhou Chuan.

535
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,270
No, it's fine.

536
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,550
I didn't attend too when you asked me

537
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,910
to discuss about the finale.

538
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,750
I'm really sorry about that.

539
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,630
Alright then.

540
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,030
Let's chat while eating.

541
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,860
Pardon me, two glasses of water please.

542
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,180
We're ready to order.

543
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,430
Here you go.

544
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,990
Ms Suo Heng.

545
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,270
Why are you here?

546
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,910
I'm working here.

547
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,950
I need to earn money after all.

548
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,150
Let's go back to
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

549
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,430
Don't help me again.

550
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,910
I'm not going back.

551
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,790
I can't be an author.

552
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,860
It's all right.

553
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,620
There're many ways to live a life.

554
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,230
We don't have to stick to one way.

555
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,510
I'm so sorry, Miss.

556
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,350
This is her first day of work.

557
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,080
Apologize to the guest, quick.

558
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,950
I'm sorry.

559
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,100
It's okay.

560
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,590
She made the wrong order

561
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,990
and even spilt the water.

562
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,670
Chu Li.

563
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,250
It'd be more embarrassing
if you follow her.

564
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,440
Let's sit first.

565
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,110
Are you persistent with every author?

566
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,360
It's different for Ms Suo Heng.

567
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,980
She gave up her all-time dream

568
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,830
and insistence.

569
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,490
Is there anything I can help with?

570
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,230
That's why I think

571
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,620
the priority is

572
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,310
to help Ms Suo Heng regain confidence.

573
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,580
I know

574
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,070
they won't approve this budget.

575
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,150
But I asked my friend.

576
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,830
And there's a venue that

577
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,350
can be rented to us for free.

578
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,550
Chief Editor Yu, do you have

579
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,080
the contact numbers of
some regular readers?

580
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,990
Chu Li.

581
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,510
I don't agree with you.

582
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,830
Why?

583
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,590
If only a few people appear,

584
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,830
it'd hit Suo Heng harder.

585
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,220
Or do you intend to invite
some other people?

586
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,190
Suo Heng

587
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,750
can tell it right away.

588
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,990
I don't intend to do so.

589
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,820
Ms Suo Heng used to say that

590
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,230
if her regular readers

591
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,780
and best friends who fought together

592
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,990
don't give up on her,

593
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,270
she'll have the courage to go on.

594
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,950
She won't agree.

595
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,870
Actually, I think so as well.

596
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,350
But I don't want to give up.

597
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,830
I believe Ms Suo Heng and you

598
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,940
feel the same too.

599
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,550
I still want to try my best.

600
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,750
Chu Li.

601
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,830
I'm sorry.

602
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,150
My regular customer wants to
organise a birthday party

603
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,350
in my bookstore.

604
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,190
So you have to

605
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,790
use my friend's place.

606
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,110
It's okay.

607
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,470
Anyway, thank you for

608
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,830
helping me find a place.

609
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,510
And it's even free of charge.

610
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,310
I hope Ms Suo Heng can
restore her ambition

611
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,310
like you used to be.

612
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,760
I believe she would.

613
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,270
Oh, right.

614
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,510
Are you free this weekend night?

615
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,060
My friend offered me two movie tickets.

616
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,670
Do you want to go with me?

617
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,270
Go to the cinema?

618
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,630
Okay.

619
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,070
Tang, Mr Maurer has replied to the email.

620
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,900
At the book fair,

621
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,270
he'll show up at Xin Dun Books's booth

622
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,630
to promote Un Oiseau Effray E.

623
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,670
That's great!

624
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,510
Just leave the rest to us.

625
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,270
How about Yun Fei?

626
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,400
How's his progress?

627
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,470
Yun Fei submitted the drafts in time
these days.

628
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,600
He's not like usual.

629
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,660
Why didn't he meet you these days?

630
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,760
He should be writing at home
since he's an author.

631
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,030
You're right.

632
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,310
Oh, right.

633
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,230

It's on Saturday night.

636
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,780
You can invite your friend

637
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,950
and have a good rest.

638
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,550
You can have them.

639
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,510
My friend and I have other activity.

640
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,150
You should have friends who
love watching movies.

641
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,270
Duo Duo.

642
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,030
I got the tickets. Thank you.

643
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,290
Are you free tonight? Let's have dinner.

649
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,910
You can tell one's personality

650
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,550
from one's bookshelf.

651
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,150
My bookshelf is the same as me myself.

652

653
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,790
You're not.

654

During the Interactive Cultural Festival,

655
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,710
I saw one of your drafts.

656
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,190
A lady in the Song Dynasty suddenly
wanted to divorce

657
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,750
and started farming.

658
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,210
It's interesting indeed.

659
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,030
I wrote it randomly.

660
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,110
You can see it as waste paper.

661
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,630
It's not.

662
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,510
I think

663
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,590
it's an excellent draft.

664
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,190
Chu Li.

665
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,430
I've told you not to

666
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,910
convince me again.

667
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,790
I'm not here to convince you.

668
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,750
I want to invite you to an event.

669
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,310
What event is it?

670
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,220
It's a small-scale reading salon

671
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,280
to celebrate your 10th anniversary.

672
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,630
For me?

673
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,940
Why don't I know?

674
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,910
Now you know it.

675
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,340
It's tomorrow.

676
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,540
The sharing theme is
Golden Spears and Armoured Horses.

677
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,030
Not many people will come.

678
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,500
But they're all your regular readers
over the decade.

679
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,140
They laughed and cried

680
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,270
over your novels.

681
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,910
They fought for you against others.

682
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,550
In other words,

683
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,150
they're strangers who know you the best.

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,590
I think

685
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,550
it's not convenient for me.

686
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,150
I have an interview tomorrow.

687
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,340
These are the surveys when
you stayed at Yuan Yue Books

I'm your fans, Xiao Yue...]

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,740
Mr Jiang, I just reached home.

694

00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,830
Thank you for asking Xiao Bai to help out.

696
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,030
Okay, bye.

697
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,230
What venue?

698
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,050
How is it related to Jiang?

699
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,710
I want to organise a meet-and-greet

700
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,630
for Ms Suo Heng.

701
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,870
Mr Jiang asked his friend

702
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,530
and rented me a place for free.

703
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,550
How kind.

704
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,680
Why didn't he offer me a discount
for my meet-and-greet?

Could you please

708
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,470
attend the event

709
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,230
so that there're more people?

710
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,910
It's her meet-and-greet.

711
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,630
Why should I attend?
I've never read her books.

712
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,990

Ms Suo Heng doesn't show up,

714
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,790
her readers will beat me up.

715
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,700
So, if Ms Suo Heng doesn't show up,

716
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,750
I can appear

717
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,750
so you won't be hit.

718
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,390
You think too much.

719
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,350
I think if you show up,

720
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,750
maybe you can protect me
from some punches.

721
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,230
There won't be a riot.

722
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,760
There're not many readers.

723
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,160
But you'll become the laughing stock.

724
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,550
She didn't even agree,

725
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,350
and yet you organised the event.

726
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,830
To be honest,

727
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,740
what should I do

728
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,710
if Ms Suo Heng

729
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,030
doesn't show up?

730
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,430
Don't worry. She'll show up.

731
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,070
Why are you so sure?

732
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,330
My intuition as an author told me.

733
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,310
Alright then.

734
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,750
You're talking nonsense

735
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,190
but I did

736
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,390
feel comforted.

Duo Duo asked me out.

741
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,230
It's what she will do indeed.

742
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,860
She told me there's another friend.

743
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,430
I didn't expect it's you.

744
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,870
Duo Duo is also my friend.

745
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,510
I received the things you sent.
