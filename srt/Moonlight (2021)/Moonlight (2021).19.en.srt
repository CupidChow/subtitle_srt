00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,270
Mr Zhou Chuan,

5
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,470
let me know if you have made

6
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,590
any decision.

7
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,470
It's all right, I can take it.

8
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,789
You are trying to say that

9
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,590
Huang Quan Inn belongs to Xin Dun Books,

10
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,950
right?

11
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,790
Something like this
has happened.

12
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,150
If I still let Yuan Yue Publishing
House to publish Huang Quan Inn,

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,990
I can't explain to my readers

14
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,190
it also goes against my own principles.

15
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,870
But I don't think you're wrong.

16
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,800
If you were to be punished for this,

17
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,470
it would not be appropriate.

18
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,220
I...

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,950
There is no such thing as punishment.

20
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,150
We are all in the same boat

21
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,790
as Yuan Yue Publishing House.

22
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,550
When something bad has happened,
no one could

23
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,950
escape responsibility.

24
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,350
However, as the editor of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

25
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,860
should I now

26
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,790
hug your thighs

27
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,380
and beg you not to give up on us?

28
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,910
Does this work?

29
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,990
No.

30
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,780
I knew it.

31
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,070
You used to be the one
who cared about me.

32
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,820
This time, I'll learn to care about you.

33
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,329
So, I won't put you
in a difficult situation.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,540
Anyway,

35
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,150
since you have finished writing
Huang Quan Inn,

36
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,590
can you serialise a new long story

37
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,460
in Moonlight Magazine again?

38
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,750
What are you laughing at?

39
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,700
I laughed at you, who're
unwilling to take a loss.

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,230
Even if you lose a sesame seeds,
you have to pick up a watermelon.

41
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,830
It's been on your mind
for a long time, right?

42
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,310
No, it's a tentative idea.

43
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,190
Well, I thought of it for quite a while.

44
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,390
Go back quickly.

45
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,829
Don't speculate on my mind here.

46
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,630
-Go.
-I...

47
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,990
Xin Dun Books signed Huang Quan Inn.

48
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,310
It happened just now.

49
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,190
What?

50
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,990
Say that again.

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,020
Didn't he say that he will let us sign

52
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,550
Huang Quan Inn?

53
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,710
Well...

54
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,590
Chu Li.

55
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,150
Don't tell Director Yang about this yet.

56
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,390
You're close with Zhou Chuan,
aren't you?

57
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,390
Go and talk to him.

58
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,540
Go, don't just stand here. Go.

59
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,910
Mr Liang,

60
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,640
I have just sent the message
into the large group.

61
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,870
When did you start to have a brain?

62
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,470
Hello.

63
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,790
Director Yang. Yes.

64
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,990
[Mr Xia just called me]

65
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,030
[and told me everything
that happened this afternoon.]

66
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,750
[This afternoon, when you asked me to]

67
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,310
[to add a scene of cosplay,]

68
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,510
[why didn't you mention that]

69
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,770
[Book of Luo He God's author disagreed?]

70
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,909
[I let you manage a little more
of the publishing house's work,]

71
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,909
[but now,]

72
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,590
[we've lost a book.]

73
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,030
Director Yang, let me explain.

74
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,470
What happened this afternoon

75
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,790
was because those cosplayers

76
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,620
were too enthusiastic.

77
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,190
If I rashly stopped them,

78
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,250
I was afraid something would happen.

79
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,430
At first...

80
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,430
Miao, come here.

81
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,030
Wait a minute, Director Yang.

82
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,760
Miao will explain to you. Miao!

83
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,030
Chu Li.

84
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,710
We've harmed others
without benefiting ourselves.

85
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,270
What about Suo Heng?

86
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,150
Chief Editor Yu,

87
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,630
I didn't intend to take revenge on

88
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,390
Liang Chong Lang and Miao.

89
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,470
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

90
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,390
I'll persuade Mr Zhou Chuan.

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,659
You just don't know

92
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,710
how calm

93
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,030
and how determined he was

94
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,550
when he told me his decision.

95
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,380
I know him very well.

96
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,380
As long as he made the decision,

97
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,030
no one can change it.

98
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,670
But you're now
completely thinking for him

99
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,070
from the author's point of view.

100
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,470
There are authors before editors.

101
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,350
Chief Editor Yu, don't worry.

102
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,340
Only Mr Liang's harmed.

103
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,990
I'm not stupid until
forget about benefiting ourselves.

104
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,790
Just now, I begged Mr Zhou Chuan

105
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,940
to give a new serial to
Moonlight Magazine again.

106
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
Really?

107
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,310
Then why didn't you
say so in this group?

108
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,900
Later.

109
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,270
Let Director Yang concentrate on

110
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,670
scolding Director Liang
for a while first.

111
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,430
You were a little girl

112
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,190
when you were recruited.

113
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,550
How did you become like this

114
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,660
after a year?

115
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,190
What have you been through?

116
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,070
Who knows?

117
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,260
Okay, you've had a hard day.

118
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,520
Go back and rest early.

119
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,550
Chief Editor Yu, goodbye.

120
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,080
Goodbye.

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,540
Mr Zhou Chuan is so kind to me,

122
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,500
I couldn't even manage
his book launch day well.

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,790
Ah Xiang,

124
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,590
do you think I'm useless?

125
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,750
[Chu Li, you think too much.]

126
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,990
He's calling me.

127
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,670
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

128
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,930
Have you arrived home?

129
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,950
I...

130
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,220
I don't want to tell you.

131
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,950
Are you drinking?

132
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,230
No.

133
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,870
I'm drinking milk.

134
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,270
You're telling nonsense

135
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,130
and you said you're not drinking?

136
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,190
I... I'm drunk with milk.

137
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,430
Hello.

138
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,430
You're still here?

139
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,190
I thought you've left
after hearing the news.

140
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,710
How is Maurer?

141
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,980
It's okay. He was sent to the hospital.

142
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,910
The doctor said he's just not
acclimatized to the new environment.

143
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,670
He'll be fine after
resting for two days.

144
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,590
But he really can't
attend tonight's dinner.

145
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,950
What a pity.

146
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,910
Such a farce happened today,

147
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,800
your readers must be very unsatisfied
with Yuan Yue Publishing House.

148
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,990
They should suffer the consequences

149
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,830
of what they did wrong.

150
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,490
You are not a philanthropist.

151
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,630
You don't want to sign the contract of

152
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,630
Huang Quan Inn with
Yuan Yue Publishing House, do you?

153
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,390
Minimum number of
printed copies is 400,000.

154
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,789
No room for negotiation.

155
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,260
Tang, prepare a contract for me

156
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,670
and have it delivered
within half an hour.

157
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,550
Don't need to be so rush.

158
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,430
I'm in a hurry to get back.

159
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,030
Ah Xiang,

160
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,510
where is Chu Li?

161
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,020

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,840
♫ If this is not love ♫

187
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,430
♫ What can I tell myself ♫

188
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,430
We kissed.

189
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,900
This is not a dream, right?

190
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,630
No.

191
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,360
This is definitely not a dream.

192
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,060
Why did I forget those parts
that I shouldn't forget?

193
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,900
Anyway,

194
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,220
he kissed me back.

195
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,110
He should be...

196
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,870
Chu Li, you can do it.

197
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,330
Mr Zhou Chuan,
for breakfast, what do you...

198
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,180
Mr Zhou Chuan.

199
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,910
Mr Zhou Chuan.

200
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,310
Where is he?

201
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,510
Er Gou.

202
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,910
Where is your brother?

203
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,430
He didn't run away,

204
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,820
did he?

205
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,830
You...

206
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,150
Did you see him?

207
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,470
Is he avoiding me?

208
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,510
Why is he avoiding me?

209
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,470
He's not regretting it, is he?

210
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,470
Look me in the eye and tell me.

211
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,270
Is he regretting it, Er Gou?

212
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,830
Hey,

213
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,790
you asked me to come here
early in the morning

214
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,670
just to see you stirring soy milk?

215
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,550
You ordered sweet soy milk.

216
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,870
How unmanly.

217
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,070
My girl,

218
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,590
if you have something to say,
say it quickly!

219
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,910
I kindly invited you to breakfast

220
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,710
early in the morning

221
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,640
not to listen to your sarcasm to me.

222
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,030
What's wrong with sweet soy milk?

223
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,470
Is your salty soy milk with
some fries and squash

224
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,400
more majestic than sweet soy milk?

225
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,590
Alright.

226
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,030
Countdown one minute.

227
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,910
If you don't say anything
within one minute,

228
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,670
I'll get going then.

229
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,190
You want to talk about soy milk

230
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,050
or tell me something on your mind.

231
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,150
Start.

232
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,830
Well...

233
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,190
I have a problem

234
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,190
with my new serial.

235
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
I admit

236
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,360
you are indeed more
experienced than me in this.

237
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,470
It's one of the few parts
that you surpass me.

238
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,400
That's why I came to you for advice.

239
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,900
I have an emotional scene.

240
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,390
Emotional scene?

241
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,050
Didn't you say there's no
emotional scene in your book?

242
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,110
It's called a breakthrough.

243
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,310
Alright. What kind of
emotional scene is it?

244
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,870
Well...

245
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,590
The male lead kissed
the female lead while

246
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,940
she was drunk.

247
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,340
What to do the next day?

248
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,390
Kissed her while she was drunk?

249
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,150
Yes.

250
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,700
The male lead is not a good guy.

251
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,190
You're not a good guy.

252
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,360
Emotions can't be restrained.

253
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,710
You've been in a relationship.

254
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,350
You...

255
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,340
Let me go further.

256
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,910
Could it be that

257
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,510
don't see each other often...

258
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,270
The male lead has fallen in love.

259
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,630
That's not the point.

260
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,230
The point is that my male lead now

261
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,950
does not know what to do.

262
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,110
He doesn't dare to
talk to the female lead.

263
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,070
Anyway, he took advantage
of a situation.

264
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,910
If the female lead thinks that

265
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,670
the male lead is such a person,

266
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,830
the degree of favourability of the
female lead towards the male lead

267
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,830
will directly be reduced
to a negative number, right?

268
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,510
Just be together, then.

269
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,670
You must be responsible for it.

270
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,110
Yes, that's for sure. But...

271
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,790
It shouldn't be now, right?

272
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,790
The female lead was
being taken advantage of.

273
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,270
She must be unhappy.

274
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,070
If the male lead said
he'd take the responsibility,

275
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,510
would he be sending
himself to the guillotine?

276
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,110
What if she thinks the male lead

277
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,710
is a villain who
took advantage of a situation?

278
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,430
Let's make it another time.

279
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,950
Hey,

280
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,010
how could you have so many
twists and turns in your mind?

281
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,070
We've been talking for so long.

282
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,130
I'll get going now.

283
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,070
I didn't expect that

284
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,710
a kiddo who drinks sweet soy milk

285
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,990
knew to take advantage of a situation.

286
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,110
Let me tell you.

287
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,580
You should really thank Chu Li

288
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,980
for not giving you a slap.

289
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,590
Who said me and Monkey...

290
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,910
Normally, you didn't get up so early.

291
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,110
How could you just disappear
after kissing me last night?

292
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,550
I used to drink too much and you
said you would take care of me.

293
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,430
Those were all lies, right?

294
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,110
That's my first kiss.

295
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,390
Scoundrel.

296
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,870
What is this?

297
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,840
What are you doing?

298
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,820
Let me help you.

299
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,990
Don't touch.

300
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,870
What are these?

301
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,190
It has nothing to do with you.

302
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,670
Don't enter my study in the future.

303
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,270
Are you mad?

304
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,030
I just want to help you clean up.

305
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,340
No.

306
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,230
So why are you so fierce?

307
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,590
Stop asking. I want to take a nap.

308
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,430
I haven't even asked yet.

309
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,490
Where did you go early in the morning?

310
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,870
Let's talk about it tonight.

311
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,750
Wait.

312
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,270
Do you remember last night...

313
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,030
Hello, Ah Xiang.

314
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,990
[Chu Li, that's bad.]

315
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,830
[Because of the book fair,]

316
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,870
[Director Yang rushed back
from outstation overnight]

317
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,670
[to conduct a critique session.]

318
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,270
[Come back quickly.]

319
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,830
Okay, I'll be right there.

320
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,230
Go ahead with your nap!

321
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,070
How do you guys work?

322
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,110
We're still the hot search
in the Internet.

323
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,150
Under the apology statement,

324
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,990
it's full of the fans' condemnations.

325
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,990
We failed to sign
Zhou Chuan's new book as well.

326
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,460
I really do not know how the site staff

327
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,780
managed.

328
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,270
Director Yang,

329
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,030
on site,

330
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,960
someone brought up
the author without informing us.

331
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,630
It gave us no time to react.

332
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,100
Mr Liang, this is not true.

333
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,910
The circulation department shortened
the activity time without permission

334
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,270
and caused fans on site
didn't have enough time to buy the book.

335
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,070
Did I mention about editorial department?

336
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,230
Why did you assume
I was talking about you?

337
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,430
Alright.

338
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,630
There is no other reason

339
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,710
for such an embarrassing incident happened

340
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,380
at yesterday's book fair.

341
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,590
It's because everyone from
Yuan Yue Publishing House is not united.

342
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,950
There was a time

343
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,810
when we were united in our efforts

344
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,470
to publish a book. But what about now?

345
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,260
We're passing the buck to each other

346
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,070
for our own benefit.

347
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,150
It is the reader's sorrow

348
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,210
that disappoints the author.

349
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,710
It is also the sorrow of publisher.

350
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,210
Director Yang,

351
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,880
I should be responsible

352
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,510
for what happened yesterday.

353
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,790
Director Yang, can I say something?

354
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,150
Today,

355
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,550
if you want someone
to bear the responsibility,

356
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,870
anyone here is to blame.

357
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,350
But if you want to solve the problem,

358
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,020
I do have a solution.

359
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,310
Chu Li,

360
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,350
why are you everywhere?

361
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,910
You're Chu Li, right?

362
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,390
Tell me your solution.

363
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,150
Mr Zhou Chuan promised

364
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,630
to serialise his next novel

365
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,510
in Moonlight Magazine.

366
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,110
But there is a prerequisite.

367
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,310
The circulation department
must apologise seriously

368
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,390
to Mr Zhou Chuan and the readers.

369
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,660
That insincere statement online
is not accepted.

370
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,670
This time, Mr Liang
personally led the team

371
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,460
to fulfil two million sales quota.

372
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,910
Even if there is no credit,
it is hard work.

373
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,790
Right?

374
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,750
Public apology from
the circulation department

375
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,830
is my promise to Mr Zhou Chuan.

376
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,070
It's also the least respect

377
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,950
Yuan Yue Publishing House can give him.

378
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,230
Otherwise,

379
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,100
it would be difficult for us

380
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,830
to sign his book from now on.

381
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,510
Director Yang, I'll make a statement.

382
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,990
For the benefit of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

383
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,550
it's okay for me to suffer a little

384
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,990
personally.

385
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,270
Anyway, even if I apologise,

386
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,230
will we able to sign Zhou Chuan's book?

387
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,510
Will you be responsible

388
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,790
when he backs out?

389
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,710
First,

390
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,270
Mr Zhou Chuan is a man of his word.

391
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,790
He's different from you.

392
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,590
Next,

393
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,460
Mr Liang, you should apologise.

394
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,390
This is a prerequisite for signing,
not a condition.

395
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,550
If we can't even do this,

396
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,150
it's impossible for us

397
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,310
to sign his book.

398
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,510
Don't forget that you're just an editor
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

399
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,430
Who are you siding with?

400
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,430
Enough!

401
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,110
Don't you say a word.

402
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,670
Chu Li, sit down.

403
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,150
Mr Xia's right just now.

404
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,990
United we stand, divided we fall.

405
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,870
Although the circulation department
exceeded its performance this time,

406
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,750
due to mistakes of work
and belittling authors,

407
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,390
they let the copyright slip through
their fingers and Xin Dun Books got it.

408
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,350
This is also indisputable, right?

409
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,630
So, the company has decided that

410
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,670
quarterly bonuses will be deducted
from the circulation department

411
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,830
and all personnel involved

412
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,870
in the Comic-Con.

413
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,910
Besides, Liang,

414
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,820
apology must be sincere.

415
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,270
Yes, I know.

416
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,480
[Zhou Chuan]

417
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,710
Wish us a happy second cooperation.

418
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,510
I'll send you the full manuscript of

419
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,110
Huang Quan Inn this evening.

420
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,110
Then, I'll be waiting to read it.

421
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,630
I won't see you out then.

422
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,150
Your fans have already paralysed

423
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,110
the official website of
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

424
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,990
Their Director Yang went to the office
early this morning for accountability.

425
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,710
I guess none of those present
yesterday could escape from it.

426
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,270
I have no control over the affairs
of their publishing house.

427
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,590
I just hope to give my fans

428
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,870
a satisfactory answer.

429
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,510
I know.

430
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,950
For you, your fans are
the most important ones.

431
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,350
Don't you worry about
that little editor?

432
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,170
I'll get going now.

433
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,210
[Zhou Chuan: You wouldn't
expect Maurer to be sick]

434
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,190
[Hey, why no response? Where
are you? Why don't you answer me?]

435
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,590
Er Gou.

436
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,030
Was I too mean to your sister today?

437
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,510
After the boy kissed your friend,

438
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,770
he even pulled a long face
in front of her?

439
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,870
How is it? Is it too much?

440
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,670
I... My friend didn't mean to do that.

441
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,150
It's an accident.

442
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,790
Chu Li,

443
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,830
your friend may really meet a bad guy.

444
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,510
They already did such an intimate thing.

445
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,910
What else can't they share
with each other?

446
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,510
It may also be
an unsatisfying experience.

447
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,470
Only when two people are willing to
share the good and bad with each other,

448
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,620
it's called love.

449
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,910
Chu Li,

450
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,460
you must be more sober.

451
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,470
You must give
wise advice to your friend.

452
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,980
Don't let her be taken advantage,

453
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,780
but still fantasizing
about owning eternal love.

454
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,070
I'm so tired and annoyed.

455
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,150
Don't be annoyed.

456
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,110
Good news for you.

457
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,310
You had worked hard for this book fair.

458
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,260
Chu Li,

459
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,110
this is the sales details
of the book fair.

460
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,100
Send it to Mr Liang.

461
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,280
You will be given
the afternoon off today.

462
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,700
Tomorrow is Chinese New Year's Eve.

463
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,580
Go home quickly to celebrate
Chinese New Year with your family.

464
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,630
Chief Editor Yu,

465
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,150
I am here to wish you happy
Chinese New Year in advance.

466
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,590
Thank you, Chief Editor Yu.

467
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,510
You've done a good job this year.

468
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,240
Keep up the good work next year.

469
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,590
What a bad luck.

470
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,390
I didn't expect
the last person I have to meet

471
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,850
before Chinese New Year
is Liang Chong Lang.

472
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,350
Chu Li,

473
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,200
change the time of
your train ticket quickly.

474
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,710
If I want to change it,

475
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,590
this evening is my only option.

476
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,230
Isn't it good,

477
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,270
so that you don't have to wake up
in the early morning tomorrow?

478
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,750
It's not bad actually.

479
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,510
[What are you thinking about?]

480
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,190
[He treated you that way]

481
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,250
[and you still want to stay with him
for another night?]

482
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
Anything is bad.

483
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,580
No problem, I'll change it now.

484
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,110
How are your plans to publish
a book after Chinese New Year?

485
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,430
Chu Li will take the manuscript home.

486
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,310
It is estimated that the final draft
will be ready in a few days.

487
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,630
You make her work on the
manuscript during Chinese New Year?

488
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,190
Shame on you.

489
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,030
Speaking of shame,

490
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,350
I still remember the story
between the male lead and female lead

491
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,590
that you told me this morning.

492
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,630
As I told you,
it has nothing to do with Monkey.

493
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,590
Alright. It has nothing to do with her.

494
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,150
Then why are you explaining to me?

495
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,830
I'm not your female lead.

496
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,030
If you were my female lead,

497
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,750
my male lead would resign on the spot.

498
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,380
I...

499
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,180
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

500
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,870
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

501
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,990
[Mr Xia and I would like to ask you out.]

502
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,670
[We want to apologise to you in person.]

503
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,660
We did it wrong this time.

504
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,720
[It's okay, I know you guys
were doing the best you can.]

505
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,830
No one

506
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,910
in your editorial department
has been punished

507
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,240
for this matter, right?

508
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,430
Only Miao and Xiao Niao who helped
the circulation department make trouble

509
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,910
were fined bonuses.

510
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,350
The others are fine.

511
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,150
[Thank you]

512
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,410
[for willing to give us another chance.]

513
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,020
Well...

514
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,590
Where is Chu Li?

515
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,190
I gave her the afternoon off.

516
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,350
She should have gone back her hometown.

517
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,550
She didn't tell you?

518
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,820
She's leaving today?

519
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,270
Alright, I got it.

520
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,310
Chu Li is leaving?

521
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,310
What do you care? I'll get going now.

522
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,670
You leave me alone again.

523
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,260
Don't call me next time.

524
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,110
Why are you waiting here?

525
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,150
What is there to wait for?

526
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,630
You're going home?

527
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,490
It's so sudden.

528
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,010
You really plan to leave
without leaving a word?

529
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,350
When do you plan to come back?

530
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,470
Not sure.

531
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,340
I'll go back to hometown
on Chinese New Year's Eve.

532
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,790
Should I take Er Gou home

533
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,870
or let my friend take care of him?

534
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,340
Up to you.

535
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,100
How can just up to me?

536
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,230
You're Er Gou sister.

537
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,870
Help me make a decision.

538
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,790
Thank you. I'll take a cab.

539
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,310
Why do you want to take a cab?

540
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,270
I'm free.

541
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,400
Let's go, I'll send you to the station.

542
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,230
I heard that you need to work on

543
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,230
Jiang Yu Cheng's manuscript
during Chinese New Year.

544
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,870
Jiang Yu Cheng

545
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,030
is so bad.

546
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,670
Are you mad...

547
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,030
Hello, Dad.

548
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,950
I'm on the way home.

549
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,910
I bought two more boxes

550

551
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,790
Are you happy?

552
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,500
That time, I ate four more at once

553
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,870
and got scolded by your mum.

554
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,870
So, did she eat it?

555
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,430
She... She won't eat.

556
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,750
She said she wanted to lose weight.

557
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,230
[The next day I looked at the box,]

558
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,030

559
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,670
[Think about what your father is doing.]

560
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,190

561
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,550
Who can she hide

562
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,190
this little trick from?

563
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,350
You are getting really arrogant now.

564
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,030
Let me ask you.

565
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,030
If I come back now to greet you,

566
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,230
is it okay?

567
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,190
[No.]

568
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,250
You should have called us in advance.

569
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,550
[You mum and I thought you will
off on Chinese New Year's Eve.]

570
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,870
Well... You mum and I are on a vacation.

571
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,150
It's fine. Have fun.

572
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,550
I can go home myself.

573
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,100
I just want Her Highness

574
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,750
be prepared.

575
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,030
If she wants to beat me up,

576
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,160
can she wash the feather duster first?

577
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,790
Your mum...

578
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,630
Your mum has worked very hard.

579
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,270
Don't you... Your mum is kind-hearted.

580
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,870
[I am also very gentle!]

581
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,110
Don't talk so much to her.

582
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,340
Whether you want to
come home or not, up to you!

583
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,110
[Hang it up.]

584
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,510
[Let's talk after you're home.]

585
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,710
What's the point of talking to her here?

586
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,970
-Let's go.
-No, she...

587
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,390
Done?

588
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,750
Thank you, I'll get going now.

589
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,150
For what happened this morning...

590
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,710
It was my fault.

591
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,370
I shouldn't enter your study.

592
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,670
I didn't mean it. I...

593
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,710
Do you have anything else to say to me?

594
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,230
What do you mean with anything else?

595
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,590
Mr Zhou Chuan,

596
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,190
before I leave,

597
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,990
I'll ask you one last time.

598
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,860
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

599
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,950
Don't drink in front of
other people in the future,

600
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,030
except me...

601
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,630
Tell me when you reach home.

602
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,990
[When is the right time?]

603
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,430
Dad!

604
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,830
Didn't you say you were on a vacation?

605
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,070
Once I received your call,

606
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,750
we rushed back immediately.

607
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,630
I haven't seen you for half a year.

608
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,910
Let me look at you.

609
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,350
You've become thinner.

610
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,110
Your chin is pointed, you...

611
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,270
Why do you work so hard?

612
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,030
Dad, do you have a bad eye?

613
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,350
I've become rounder.

614
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,150
Hello.

615
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,550
Now?

616
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,010
Okay, I'll be right there.

617
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,830
I got it, go now.

618
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,720
Remember, don't fall out with your mum.

619
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,550
If you can't take it,
hang in there until I get back.

620
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,350
-Remember, okay?
-Don't worry.

621
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,230
I'm ready for anything.

622
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,630
I can stand it this time.

623
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,070
If you can't, just use softness
to conquer strength.

624
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,270
I got it.

625
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,510
Come back early.

626
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,510
I'm back.

627
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,790
Your Highness.

628
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,750
I'm here to apologise to you.

629
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,270
Since I kneel on the foot
reflexology board on my own initiative,

630
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,510
please don't be mad at me anymore.

631

632
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,510

633
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,990
Mummy.

634
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,830
What's going on? Why is no one here?

635
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,070
I acted so emotional.

636
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,070
It hurts so much.

637
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,950
It's better to be at home.

638
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,270
You're back to pretend
to be miserable, right?

639
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,350
Oh my God! Why don't
you just act till the end?

640
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,870
-Why do you...
-Where did you show up from?

641
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,430
You were making fake tears, right?

642
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,670
-Mum!
-You...

643
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,070
-Listen to me.
-Keep running away!

644
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,030
How dare you run away!

645
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,950
Mum!

646
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,590
The price of feather duster has risen.

647
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,790

What a waste of money.

Do you think your sister has reached home?

651
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,409
She should have reached home, right?

652
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,320
Why didn't she send a message
to me once she reached?

653
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,810
Could it be that
she really gets mad at me?

654
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,460
What should I do?

655
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,030
Apologise?

656
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,909
What a joke!

657
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,870
How can I possibly apologise?

658
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,710
You know too little about me.

659
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,790
The word "apology"

660
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,989

if I don't have to aid you.

667
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,030
Yes, you're right.

668
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,280
Give me your superior's phone number.

669
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,190

670
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,950
What? Resign for you.

Tell me quickly.

674
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,310
No, I won't resign.

675
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,590
Mum, it's indeed my fault
as I went to Shanghai

676
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,060
without informing you.

677
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,030

732
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,870
Bai Zhi,

733
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,460
didn't you say

734
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,310
you're going home with Xiao Jiang
to celebrate Chinese New Year?

735
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,230
Come home with me this Chinese New Year.

736
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,440
Go home with you?

737
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,830
Yes.

738
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,030
You would say it's too fast

739
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,630
or to accompany Ms Liu back then.

740
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,350
It's my turn this year, right?

741
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,820
I have to ask Ms Liu first.

742
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,150
Ms Liu will definitely agree.

743
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,950
Not necessarily.

744
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,630
How can I go home with you so easily?

745
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,430
I have begged you four or five times.

746
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,310
I'll think about it.

747
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,590
Be honest with me.

748
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,250
If you don't want to go with me,

749
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,030
who do you want to go with?

750
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,310
Are you crazy?

751
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,270
Ms Liu, you remember wrongly.

752
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,520
This year, I'll be with you.

753
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,590
I remember wrongly.

754
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,540
I have poor memory.

755
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,830
I bought some new clothes for you.

756
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,310
Let's try it out later.

757
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,750
New... New clothes.

758
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,210
We wear new clothes
during Chinese New Year.

759
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,870
It's great to have new clothes.

760
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,270
Bai Zhi,

761
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,990
go and get the watch

762
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,660
of me and my husband.

763
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,460
I want to give them for you and
Xiao Jiang as a Chinese New Year's gift.

764
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,310
Ms Liu,

765
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,070
you gave me that watch last time.

766
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,790
I already gave it to you?

767
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,070
Why are you not wearing it then?

768
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,430
That watch is too expensive.

769
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,070
We can't wear it.

770
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,980
That's not expensive.

771
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,550
It's just a remembrance.

772
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,950
Where did I put my watch?

773
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,630
Ms Liu,

774
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,620
have more porridge.

775
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,430
Next time, we will wear that watch.

776
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,560
Alright, it's good that you'd wear it.

777
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,310
Did doctor say

778
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,710
what else can be done
with Ms Liu's disease?

779
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,770
There is no specific drug for Alzheimer.

780
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,800
There is nothing special
that doctors can do.

781
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,710
Let's hope she

782
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,440
doesn't deteriorate too much.

783
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,310
I don't know

784
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,470
what I will do if she doesn't even

785
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,910
recognize me one day.

786
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,560
I shouldn't talk about this since
Chinese New Year is soon coming.

787
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,740
Are you going back
to hometown this year?

788
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,310
When will you go back?

789
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,070
Tomorrow maybe.
You know Zhou Chuan well too.

790
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,710
He would just delay as long as he can.

791
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,950
What about you?

792
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,070
You'll stay here this year?

793
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,100
Your new book will be launched
after Chinese New Year, right?

794
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,470
All the best.

795
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,110
Thank you.

796
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,470
Thank you

797
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,190
for visiting Ms Liu with me.

798
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,100
Ms Liu is also my elder.

799
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,630
I should come and visit her.

800
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,790
I'll get going now then.

801
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,820
Take care.

802
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,310
Jiang Yu Cheng.

803
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,700
Happy Chinese New Year!

804
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,830
Happy Chinese New Year.
