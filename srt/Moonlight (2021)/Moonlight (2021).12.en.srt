[Episode 12]

4
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,100
Both of you are dating?

5
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,200
So, what's going on?

6
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,990
I dragged her into some trouble before,

7
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,150
and caused her to lose out on her salary.

8
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,670
She almost had to sleep on the street.

9
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,539
That period

10
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,270
was when Book of Luo He God

11
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,710
was about to be prepared.

12
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,670
I was afraid that her being homeless

13
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,350
would affect her creativity,

14
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,280
so I lent her my second-floor room.

15
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,390
Why are you so nervous?

16
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,470
So, why was she in your room?

17
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,060
Was it to hide from me?

18
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,110
Yes!

19
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,550
So, the two of you really don't

20
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,830
have that kind of relationship
that I imagined?

21
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,230
No!

22
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,120
It seems I still have a chance.

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,350
That's good.

24
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,990
What's so good?

25
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,150
Chu Li.

26
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,470
Hey!

27
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Don't make noise.

28
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,380
Chu Li.

29
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,510
I like you.

30
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,860
But...

31
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,750
Sir...

32
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,510
What's your problem, Jiang Yu Cheng?

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,390
You eat when you're tired,

34
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,110
you sleep when you're hungry.

35
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,990
If you're sick go see a doctor,

36
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,120
don't be crazy here!

38
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,530
I know this is very sudden,

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,650
but I'm not joking.

40
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,590
Zhou Chuan,

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,230
Chu Li is our editor.

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,500
She isn't one of your underlings,

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,750
and definitely isn't your belonging.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,990
To you,

45
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,340
she is nothing but your editor.

46
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,910
To me...

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,710
Yes.

48
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,870
But to me,

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,630
I hope that she becomes my girlfriend.

50
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,750
It's okay.

51
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,990
Don't rush to answer me.

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,790

56
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,870

Don't be fooled by his sweet words.

65
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,339
It's impossible between you two.

66

I...

67
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,310
Why is it impossible?

68
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,310
So, you actually want to be with him?

69
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,270
I have not slept since last night,

70
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,150
so my head is really dizzy.

71

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,270

God, he's just too good.

Why do you think it's him?

80
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,370
What could she possibly mean?

81
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,110
Could it be she really likes
Jiang Yu Cheng?

82
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,350

00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,280

Sorry, I didn't mean it.

However,

105
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,990
I meant everything I said yesterday.

Anyway, I'm sorry, Mr Jiang.

111
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,909
It's okay.

112
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,820
I won't give up just because

Why did you buy something too?

193
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,990
Mr Jiang bought these for all of you.

194

He wants to extend
his regards to everyone.

It doesn't matter if he loses popularity.

198
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,160
This book will still sell well.

199
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,750
To you, is the quality of an author

200
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,390

201
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,430

Greetings from Mr Jiang?

209
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,270
That Jiang is really crafty.

210
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,270
He even sent welfare to the editors.

211
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,270
These underhanded tactics...

212
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,380
Hello?

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,310
Stay away from those macarons.

Sir, you sounded like

219
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,310
the desserts are laced with arsenic.

220
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,550

This is a kind reminder from me.

I'll suspect that you're jealous.

227

Who would I be jealous of?

228
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,240
Would I be jealous of you destroying the
relationship of Jiang Yu Cheng and me?

229
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,670
She hung up on me again!

230
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,110
Oh, Er Gou.

231
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,230
She only thinks about Jiang Yu Cheng now.

232
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,670
She has forgotten us.

242
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,270
ever since yesterday,

243
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,990
you've been acting very strange.

244
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,070
Your book is selling well.
Why are you so irritable?

245
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,590
Who offended you?

246
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,630
An ungrateful person hung up on me.

247
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,630
I'll help you to teach her a lesson.

248
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,100
I'll go make dinner.

249
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,070
Wait.

250
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,110
That...

251
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,100
About the question that Jiang Yu Cheng
asked you yesterday.

252
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,030
How much have you thought about it?

253
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,150
I've clarified things with him.

254
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,190
What did you clarify?

255
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,780
Nothing much.

256
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,510
You shouldn't care about this.

257
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,030
Why is she blushing?

258
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,330
Because of Jiang Yu Cheng?

259
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,510
Chu Li!

260
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,670
I heard that the Book of Luo He God

261
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,530
is about to receive praise today.

262
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,750
Ms Li, why are you here?

263
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,790
I'm also a member
of the editorial department!

264
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,300
I have to be here
during glorious time like this!

265
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,430
Maybe there are rewards being received.

266
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,310
The Book of Luo He God sold so well.

267
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,870
The prize money must be at least 5000!

268
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,800
It might even be tens of thousands!

269
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,590
I already think 5000 is a lot.
I didn't expect tens of thousands.

270
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,850
Remember to treat us when the time comes!

271
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,190

272
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,390
if Book of Luo He God sells well,

as deputy editor.

00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,070
Congratulations, Chu Li!

277
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,030
It's only been just over half a year,

and you've become the ace editor of

279
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,990
See, I told you!

280
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,070
Make sure to remember
the expression on Miao's face.

281
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,870
Bye!

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,710

the giant's shoulder.

Is Jiang Yu Cheng not attending?

360
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,700
We have contacted Jiang Yu Cheng,

361
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,430
but he said he would not attend.

362
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,870
Put his name on the list.

363
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,470
I'll follow up on this matter myself.

364
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,910
Okay.

365
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,120
There's another thing.

for three days already.

Have you been to his house?

369
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,080
We've been there. No one was in.

370
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,420
I'll handle it.

371
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,550
[Hello, the caller you are dialling
is currently switched off.]

372
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,270
[Please dial again shortly.]

373
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,790
How did you find me?

374
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,510
You always play here
whenever you're unhappy.

375
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,480
You should find somewhere new.

376
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,070
Tell me. What's wrong?

377
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,570
When something happened to Ms Liu
the other day,

378
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,240
you just cried in front of him.

379
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,910
Before he arrived,

380
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,390
I was always by your side.

381
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,230
Am I so unreliable?

382
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,310
Just because of this?

383
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,460
Of course not.

384
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,750
Both Jiang Yu Cheng and I

385
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,390
write mystery stories.

386
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,630
When my first book was published,

387
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,030
some people called me
a mini Jiang Yu Cheng.

388
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,310
Fine.

389
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,910
So, I avoided modern stories.

390
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,640
I wrote stories about the past.

391
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,110
I just don't want to be called
a mini Jiang Yu Cheng.

392
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,790
But Ms Liu...

393
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,310
When she met me that day,

394
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,970
she also called me Xiao Jiang.

395
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,870
Then you got drunk,

396
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,550
held onto my hand

397
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,880
and called out his name.

398
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,500
I am not a mini Jiang Yu Cheng.

399
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,390
I am Yun Fei.

400
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,350
You're clear about
the situation I'm in, right?

401
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,350
That day,

402
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,670
I really was drunk.

403
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,030
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,790
No one sees you as just a replacement.

405
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,630
What's the point of

406
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,490
driving yourself into a dead end?

407
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,950
I don't know where you got

408
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,410
such messy thoughts from.

409
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,190
But no matter where they're from,

410
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,720
you have to dispose of them.

411
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,270
What's most important to you
right now is writing.

412
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,070
Don't forget that when
spring comes next year,

413
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,470
you and Jiang Yu Cheng will publish
new stories at the same time.

414
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,600
Don't you want to stop being called
a mini Jiang Yu Cheng?

415
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,640
If you beat him,
he will be the mini Yun Fei.

416
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,270
Sister.

417
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,650
Do you think I can do it?

418
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,870
Of course.

419
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,790
How can someone scouted by me ever lose?

420
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,190
Alright.

421
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,040
I'll be going back to write.

422
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,150
Go.

423
00:22:59,390 --> 00:22:59,950
For you.

424
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,350
Thank you.

425
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,340
[I've recently been reading
Zhou Chuan's Book of Luo He God.]

427

[Through this masterpiece,]

428
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,030
[I've definitely come in contact with
an interesting soul.]

429
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,870
[And it's one in a million.]

430
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,270
[All the complaints you've had of him]

431
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,030
[are clearly your biases showing.]

432
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,310
[I've discovered that he's even more
outstanding than Jiang Yu Cheng.]

433
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,990

[I'm extremely honoured.]

437
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,790
[But an interesting soul and a toxic soul]

438
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,650
[are fundamentally different.]

439
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,590
She has the nerve to say my soul is toxic?

[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

441
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,550
[Even Zhou Chuan
is uninteresting for you.]

442
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,750
[You must have a really high standard.]

443
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,110
[So, what are your standards
in choosing a partner?]

What's up with Mr Fox?

447
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,790
He keeps asking these weird questions.

448
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,110
My standard of a partner,
is it Jiang Yu...

449
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,990
Chu Li,

450
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,230
Hurry, look at the email!

451
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,220
[Yes]

You're here too?

455
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,230
I was thinking about inviting you.

456
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,430
I don't like the way you played it.

457
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,310
What's up with you?

458
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,310
Are you not going to use a racket?

459
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,350
Don't talk so much.

460
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,950
I'll be playing against you.

461
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,710
Ever since graduating from high school,

462
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,150
I haven't played

463
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,750
such a fun match of squash with you.

464
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,260
You asked to be tortured.

465
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,670
When do you plan on telling Chu Li

466
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,400
that you are her online friend?

467
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,120
I don't plan to tell her.

468
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,830
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

469
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,100
[I'm honoured that you like me.]

470
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,030
[However,]

[It's...]

475
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,830
[It's a friend online I made
a long time ago.]

476
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,430
[His name is Mr Fox.]

477
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,310
[Mr Fox?]

478
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,390
[So, does this Mr Fox]

479
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,590
[know about your feelings?]

480
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,920
[Does he also like you?]

481
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,320
[I'm not very sure either.]

482
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,030
[Anyway, I'm sorry, Mr Jiang.]

483
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,070
You've always been

484
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,550
an awkward

485
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,410
and indirect person since young.

486
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,590
I can't hear what you're saying.

487
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,710
Speaking of being awkward,

488
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,370
some people really are dense.

489
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,670
Just like a drowning person finding
a piece of driftwood,

490
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,790
then claiming it as his own.

491
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,790
When seeing a good umbrella
on a rainy day,

492
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,250
he wants to snatch it out
from others' hands.

493
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,310
She's been quietly supporting me
all these years.

494
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,750
It's quite unclear

495
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,740
that who will be the winner.

496
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,630
Someone like Gu Bai Zhi suits you.

497
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,510
Don't trouble Chu Li.

498
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,570
Stay away from her.

499
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,230
Whether or not we're suitable,

500
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,690
I'm very clear about that.

501
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,410
You aren't being jealous, right?

502
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,470
What would I be jealous of you?

503
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,130
What would I be jealous of you?

504
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,270
Are your sales better than mine?

505
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,000
Or are you more popular than me?

506
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,030
I'm warning you.

507
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,630
I'm Yuan Ye Publishing House's
ace author now.

508
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,780
If you get on my nerves,

509
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,180
I'll make them
end their contract with you.

510
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,910
[All employees of Yuan Publishing：]

511
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,280
[Mr Liang Chong Lang has been chosen
to receive the "Best Employee" award]

512
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,160
[and a cash bonus of 5000 yuan.]

513
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,190
Dear colleagues.

514
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,530
Mr Liang has bought coffee for everyone.

515
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,070
The sales for Book of Luo He God

516
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,030
have hit 349,000 copies!

517
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,830
This is the best result in
Yuan Yue Publishing House's

518
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,890
five year history.

519
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,510
The circulation department

520
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,820
is extremely grateful for the support
from our editorial colleagues.

521
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,110
Enjoy.

522
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,830
After waiting so long,
we only got a cup of coffee?

523
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,550
Mr Liang's sales figures this time

524
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,150
are just too strange, right?

525
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,460
349,000 copies.

526
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,970
With just another 1000 copies,
it would have been 350,000.

527
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,910
Deputy Editor Miao's spot

528
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,430
is about to be yours.

529
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,700
Chu Li, what a pity.

530
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,410
Who's speaking right now?

531
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,750
Isn't this

532
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,810
Sis Xian Yu who enjoys disappearing?

533
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,830
Editor Xian Yu,

534
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,950
do you think that my role
as a deputy editor

535
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,670
can be given to whoever you like?

536
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,190
That will depend on
the rules of our organisation.

537
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,260
I think that

538
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,670
you're not here to work,

539
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,800
but you're just here for a show, right?

540
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,790
My hip hurts!

541
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,790
Sisters, keep up the good work.

542
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,230
I'm going back to rest.

543
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,790
Goodbye, Sis Xian Yu.

544
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,870
Goodbye.

545
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,590
This is too unfair, right?

546
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,460
Not a single word is used to credit
us from the editorial department.

547
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,070
In future, our editorial department

548
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,470
is going to carry even less weight before
those of the circulation department.

549
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,470
I originally wanted to

550
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,550
use the prize money to change my glasses.

551
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,900
Now I can't change them.

552
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,590
Ah Xiang.

553
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,670
Are the wages from the firm

554
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,270
not even enough for you to change
your glasses?

555
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,910
What are you complaining about?

556
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,990
We're all from Yuan Yue Publishing House.

557
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,100
Those in the circulation department

558
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,310
spend all day looking at
advertising and sales.

559
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,470
Their job is not easy too.

560
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,870
You can't blame them for
receiving a prize.

561
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,910
We worked very hard too.

562
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,000
This is precisely my point.

563
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,750
We're lucky

564
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,580
if we find people like Zhou Chuan

565
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,560
who bring in their own readers.

566
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,950
As an editor,

567
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,170
we shouldn't be surprised

568
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,990
if a book like this sell well.

569
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,050
If it's unable to sell well,
that's a true achievement.

570
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,990
Once Mr Zhou Xuan publicised
the story online,

571
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,190
the shares by readers
were over 10,000 in an hour.

572
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,120
Let's not think about superstars.

573
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,820
But among authors,

574
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,350
this sort of influence is rare.

575
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,020
That's why I'm saying,

576
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,870
you as an editor

577
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,020
being able to sell so many books
in such a short time

578
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,550
has nothing to do with your ability.

579
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,070
It was just a matter of good luck.

580
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,110
People were praising the subscription
letter of the new editor as well-written,

581
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,510
but what do sales have
to do with the letter?

582
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,300
Maybe no one even read what she wrote.

583
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,830
People only know that
its Zhou Chuan's book.

584
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,950
So, they just blindly add

585
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,070
a few zeroes behind their orders.

586
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,030
Since you're sure that
Mr Zhou Xuan's sales

587
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,790
will be good,

588
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,390
why Deputy Editor Miao, you were unwilling

589
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,710
to increase the value of the contract?

590
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,390
Book of Luo He God sold so well.

591
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,950
Even a mere 200 copies

592
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,110
were related to the subscription letter
that I edited many times,

593
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,910
I was still the one who managed
to make his sign contact with us

594
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,100
even with our small amount
of guaranteed printing.

595
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,190
Chu Li.

596
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,060
Are you not satisfied
with my criticism?

597
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,390
Is your ego so inflated?

598
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,630
Do you speak to your superior like this?

599
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,290
What kind of attitude is this?

600
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,470
Living off peoples' glory,

601
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,630
is this your skill?

602
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,430
Standing on a house someone else built,

603
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,690
showing off shamelessly, is this skill?

604
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,590
If you have the skill,

605
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,460
you should build your own house!

606
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,390
Our editorial department

607
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,590
did not receive a commendation this time.

608
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,150
I'll say this to all of you.

609
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,230
"It is through work that we improve,
and all efforts will be repaid one day."

610
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,270
Okay, the quadrennial Huazhi Award

611
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,750
have begun judging again.

612
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,550
If the material submitted by

613
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,110
our editorial department can win a prize,

614
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,870
no one can take this honour away from us.

615
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,980
The Huazhi Award.

616
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,750
So, Mr Xia, which work from
our editorial department

617
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,070
do you intend to push forward?

618
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,220
From the first section,
there's The Edge from Mr Chu,

619
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,590
and Daybreak from Ms Zheng.

620
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,190
For the second department, there's
science fiction work from He Ma,

621
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,260
The Earth.

622
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,990
Mr He Ma

623
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,510
is a good author.

624
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,710
The chance of winning will be very high.

625
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,870
And, Book of Luo He God from Zhou Chuan.

626
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,030
Book of Luo He God.

627
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,990
Mr Xia,

628
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,310
Huazhi Award

629
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,040
is an award for serious
traditional literature.

630
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,230
Although Zhou Chuan's book

631
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,260
is a traditional legend,

632
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,990
it has quite a lot of
fantasy elements, right?

633
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,550
Maybe...

634
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,590
Times are changing.

635
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,110
Even the old heads judges

636
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,070
should know that it's time

637
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,340
to accept the modern trends.

638
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,150
And we should also

639
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,390
keep up with this trend.

640
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,060
Chu Li,

641
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,590
check on Mr Zhou Chuan's
opinion immediately.

642
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,070
Okay.

643
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,830
If Zhou Chuan has a conflict of emotion,

644
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,910
remember,

645
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,030
heroes struggle to deal with beauties.

646
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,670
Whether or not Chu Li is a beauty
is yet to be seen.

647
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,670
But, she will give it a try.

648
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,100
Don't worry, Mr Xia.

649
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,910
A matter like this where he can
receive honour

650
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,910
should not cause him any conflict.

651
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,430
Hello, what's up?

652
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,310
Mr Zhou Chuan,

653
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,040
from your voice,
I guess you're not in a good mood.

654
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,510
I'm hanging up if there's nothing.

655
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,350
There's something!

656
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,270
Mr Zhou Chuan,

657
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,470
Mr Xia brought up Huazhi Award today.

658
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,380
You should know about it, right?

659
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,760
You want to submit
Book of Luo He God for the award?

660
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,150
Impossible. I'm not going!

661
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,350
Hello?

662
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,390
Chu Li.

663
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,870
It's hot.

664
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,790
Ah Xiang, I finally know

665
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,710
why Mr Xia

666
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,750
wanted me to desperately
ask Mr Zhou Chuan

667
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,260
about Huazhi Award.

668
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,340
Ginger gets spicier the older it gets.

669
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,350
Mr Zhou Chuan was very steadfast
in his decision

670
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,980
to not submit his work to
participate in the Huazhi Award.

671
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,150
I can't understand.

672
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,790
Why someone would avoid honours so much?

673
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,520
You don't need to be so anxious.

674
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,140
I think that you should

675
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,590
have a good talk with Mr Zhou Chuan.

676
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,590
This matter doesn't only involve him,

677
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,180
but also Mr Xia.

678
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,820
Why?

679
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,700
Last time when Mr Xia

680
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,710
was in charge of Time Is Like A Song
from Old Mr Zhou,

681
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,590
he still wanted to improve it.

682
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,790
In the end, the book did
not win in Huazhi Award.

683
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,700
And so by mistake,

684
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,150
it was awarded to another book.

685
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,790
This kind of thing happened?

686
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,620
Has he never sent a book
for judging since then?

687
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,110
He did.

688
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,910
In the past years of Huazhi Award,

689
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,190
all the books handled by Mr Xia
were submitted.

690
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,830
But they were only given
honourable mentions.

691
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,560
He was snubbed again and again.

692
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,380
And people started to call him

693
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,150
the Murakami of the editorial world.

694
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,030
Being snubbed for 20 years?

695
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,830
No wonder Mr Xia is so vocal about

696
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,699
how he owes Yuan Yue Publishing House
a Huazhi Award.

697
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,870
If I were him, I would
be determined to get it too.

698
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,900
Yes.

699
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,909
This might be Mr Xia's last chance

700
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,550
before he retires.

701
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,750
[How can I convince Zhou Chuan?]

702
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:44,949
Don't leave.

703
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,610
I'm here to talk to you about work.

704
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,230
A lot of your old friends

705
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,470
will be attending
Xin Dun Creative Exchange.

706
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,870
I'm sorry.

707
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,390
I've already told your company.

708
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,420
I'm busy.

709
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,420
You have time.

710
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,670
You just don't want to go.

711
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,670
It's better for you to interact more

712
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,710
in the authors' circle.

713
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,030
There are many things that
you will not learn about

714
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,690
if you stay in this bookstore.

715
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,620
If in the future,

716
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,150
you wish to leave
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

717
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,280
and want to find a new editor,
and a new publishing house,

718
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,680
those information will be useful for you.

719
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,330
[Xin Dun Creative Exchange]

720
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,950
Who's there?

721
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,670
Mr Liang,

722
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,270
I need to thank you for
that previous matter.

723
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,430
About the number 349,000,

724
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,360
I understand your meaning.

725
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,870
Please don't mind that I criticise you.

726
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,190
You're already old.

727
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,270
You shouldn't speak so inappropriately

728
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,950
in front of a little girl.

729
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,930
You almost threw away your position.

730
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,470
I was too careless.

731
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,590
Who knew that Zhou Chuan's book

732
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,790
would be able to sell so well?

733
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,230
It's fine now.

734
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,430
Chu Li

735
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,910
is even more arrogant and domineering.

736
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,710
Why does she dare to act this way?

737
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,510
It's because you're the deputy editor.

738
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,390
Yu Yao is the chief editor.

739
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,550
She's supporting the little girl.

740
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,950
Would she respect you?

741
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,350
Miao,

742
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,350
have you ever thought of

743
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,420
a promotion?

744
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,710
There's nothing special about

745
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,430
the role of chief editor.

746
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,790
Look,

747
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,470
the wages don't increase much.

748
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,430
The workload and responsibilities

749
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,230
increase substantially instead.

750
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,710
Unlike now, I'm a deputy editor

751
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,270
and I'm still relatively relaxed.

752
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,790
You can continue to act.

753
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,520
You continue acting before me.

754
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,510
If you want to relax, it's easy.

755
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,840
If you relax, you will also
be taken advantage of.

756
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,860
Miao.

757
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,830
Thank you.

758
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,820
Think about it.

759
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,750
If you become the chief editor,

760
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,710
who at Yuan Yue Publishing House
will dare to take advantage of you?

761
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,170
Think of it in another way.

762
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,500
If you don't want
to work at Yuan Yue Publishing House

763
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,140
and want go to some other big company,

764
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,510
if you go with the role of chief editor,

765
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,310
you will at least be a director, right?

766
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,950
If you remain in your role
as a deputy editor,

767
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,790
you'll only be offered a manager position.

768
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,990
I'm sure you're clear of how

769
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,430
power is distributed among
those in charge here.

770
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,550
Of course.

771
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,980
This is your personal matter.

772
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,350
I won't force you.

773
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,510
I agree with you.

774
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,470
But,

775
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,670
Yu Yao was handpicked by Mr Xia.

776
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,270
Although she used to be busy

777
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,070
handling matters at home,

778
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,510
in terms of her work,

779
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,420
there aren't any major flaws.

780
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,470
So...

781
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,710
During the cultural exchange event,

782
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,900
wasn't there an author called Suo Heng?

783
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,630
She's a good friend of Yu Yao.

784
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,270
This Suo Heng.

785
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,590
I wanted to use this matter

786
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,790
to make her leave.

787
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,790
How was her sales?

788
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,470
If her sales were good,

789
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,310
how could I let her leave?

790
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,150
Didn't Director Yang say
during the meeting,

791
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,820
writers with poor sales

792
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,260
must be dealt with without consideration?

793
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,320
He repeated that their contracts
have to be nullified,

794
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,630
am I right?

795
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,300
What kind of person is Yu Yao?

796
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,430
She's someone who values loyalty, right?

797
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,390
This is something she's always stressed.

798
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,910
Will she protect this good friend of hers

799
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,380
whole-heartedly?

800
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,790
What do you think will happen to her?

801
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,150
She'll then

802
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,670
be against Director Yang.

803
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,430
I'm not sure if this counts

804
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,230
as a flaw in her work.

805
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,670
[Who's that? Didn't you see me?]

806
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,990
[I'm sorry, Brother Xiao Chen.]

807
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,520
[I did not do it on purpose.]

808
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,050
[It's you, Xiao Niao.]

809
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,190
-[I'll help you pick them up.]
-[It's fine.]

810
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,910
[Let me do it.]

811
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,070
[Do you want to go to get that checked
at the hospital?]

812
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,550
[It's nothing. I'm not that weak.]

813
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,910
[Let's go. I'll send you
to the editorial department.]

814
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,950
[Thank you, Brother Xiao Chen.
You're such a nice person.]

815
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,680
[This is just what I should do.]

816
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,860
[Xiao Niao just stood there]

817
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,870
[and barely moved.]

818
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,750
[And she found a free worker.]

819
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,470
[I've got it, Chu Li.
You try acting as a spoilt kid too.]

820
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,190
[What?]

821
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,560
[You act like a spoilt kid too!]

822
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,830
[Are you suggesting that]

823
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,490
[I should act like a spoilt kid
to Mr Zhou Chuan?]

824
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,830
Acting like a spoilt kid...
Could it be that it's useful?

825
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,510
My stomachache!

826
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:07,700
Mr Zhou Chuan, are you at home?

827
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:12,710
My stomachache!

828
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,030
Mr Zhou Chuan!

829
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,390
Mr Zhou Chuan, I can't stand it!

830
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:27,300
My stomach really hurts, Mr Zhou Chuan!

831
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,660
Mr Zhou Chuan, please save me!

832
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,270
My stomach really hurts!

833
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,180
Mr Zhou Chuan, I can't stand it!

834
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,950
Mr Zhou Chuan!

835
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,830
Where did he go?

836
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,190
Where did who go?

837
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,390
Mr Zhou! So, you were at home!

838
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,990
It's okay.
Please continue your performance.

839
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,110
Mr Zhou Chuan, I know that

840
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,910
you're a stream of clarity
in the literary world,

841
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,110
and the solitary wolf on the plains.

842
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,990
But it is really very hard

843
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,750
to get shortlisted in Huazhi Award!

844
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,790
Think about it. If you win,

845
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,150
then you'll earn something!

846
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,740
Even if you don't win anything,
you don't lose anything too.

847
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,910
From now onwards,

848
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,150
if you say another word

849
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,140
about this matter,

850
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,310
I will start charging you rent.

851
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,510
It starts from 1,000 yuan with no limit.

852
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,470
Mr Zhou Chuan,

853
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,310
participating in the Huazhi Award

854
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,790
is really beneficial for you.

855
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,350
Mr Xia is different

856
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,710
from me who treat authors

857
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,470
as weapons to obtain fame.

858
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,990
He really does mean well for you.

859
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,790
The words that you just said

860
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,590
inclusive of the punctuation marks

861
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,790
cost you the rent of 10,800 yuan

862
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,830
every month.

863
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,380
I can't even afford 1,800 yuan.

864
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,950
Where will I find
the money to pay 10,800 yuan?

865
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,870
Mr Zhou Chuan!

866
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,390
Won't you consider it even a little?
