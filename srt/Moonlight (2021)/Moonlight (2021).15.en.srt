[Episode 15]

4
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,870
When you told me to
quit the publishing house

5
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,590
and focus on surviving,

6
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,180
I didn't listen to you as well.

7
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,070
Yeah, since when have you
ever listened to me?

8
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,550
[Oh no.]

9
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,610
[That's what Mr Fox had said before.]

10
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,509
Since when have I told you that?

11
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,750
We were strangers

12
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,080
before you came into the industry, right?

13
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,110
If we knew each other before,

14
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,310
I would've told you to give up
being an editor.

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,710
Look at you right now.

16
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,640
You can't even afford to pay a fine.

17
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,870
Who would've thought that

18
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,990
the wealthy Mr Zhou Chuan

19
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,670
would hold it against me
for a meagre fine?

20
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,350
There's hot water in the pot.

21
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,150
Why are you drinking cold water?

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,470
Hello, Sister?

23
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,630
You've returned home?

24
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,190
We can talk about Huang Quan Inn later.

25
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,980
You can go and annoy your Jiang Yu Cheng.

26
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,440
I'll hang up now. Goodbye.

27
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,990
You should return now.

28
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,150
It's been tough on you.

29
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,190
I've wasted two hours

30
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,390
of your writing time.

31
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,030
How could it be a waste of my time

32
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,560
when I'm together with you?

33
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,670
I read the ending you wrote
while I was on the plane.

34
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,150
You need to change it according to
what we've discussed.

35
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,010
Let me carry it.

36
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,630
Sister, I know now.

37
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,590
After I'm done helping you out,

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,710
I'll return and write immediately.

39
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,910
Don't worry, I won't lose.

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,660
I've put your things into your room.

We used them as our bookmarks

You don't like it?

56

Forget about it then. I thought
it could serve as a memento.

love comes upon once in your life?

76
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,030
I've thought about it many times.

77
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,390
One day, when I'm old,

78
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,910
there's someone who would
still hold my hand.

79
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,470
We would take a walk in the park together.

80
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,630
As the breeze passes by us,

81
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,830
the sun

82
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,990
will shine on us.

83
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,310
Birds will chirp on the trees.

84
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,090
No matter how many times I think about it,

85
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,350
Jiang Yu Cheng was always
the one on my mind.

86
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,030
He will still make you sad.

87
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,590
I know that.

88
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,030
But I don't know how to give up

89
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,350
on that idealistic image of mine.

90
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,990
Sister.

91
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,830
Go back now.

92
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,390
I want to be alone.

93
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,790
I have something to discuss with you.

94
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,030
We need to determine who will cook
and who will do the work.

95
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,630
Why don't you determine who will cook
and who will eat the food?

96
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,750
You're the one eating.

97
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,830
That's a given.

98
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,380
Do you think this is enough?

99
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,470
That's too much.

100
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,390
You can wash

101
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,920
all of our cooking utensils
with that amount.

102
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,030
Do you even know how to wash dishes?

103
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,980
Use this.

104
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,550
The metal sponge is used to clean pots.

105
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,430
Isn't all of it the same?

106
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,540
Mr Zhou Chuan,

107
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,320
do you have a smurf account?

108
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,790
[Here she comes again.]

109
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,030
What smurf account?

110
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,610
I don't even have enough time
to handle my main account.

111
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,510
I haven't told you what kind of
smurf account I'm talking about.

112
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,030
I don't have any smurf account.

113
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,549
Weibo, WeChat, QQ, none of them.

114
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,970
Why are you asking me this?

115
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,950
Nothing. It's just a random question.

116
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,900
Mr Zhou Chuan,

117
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,540
I discovered something interesting.

118
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,230
What is it?

119
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,750
For every ending of your story,

120
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,670
you'll put five ellipses at the back.

121
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,070
Is that a habit of yours?

122
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,870
Can't I do so?

123
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,190
Of course you can. It's just that

124
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,190
one of my online friend
has the same habit as you.

125
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,990
Plenty of people
have the same habit, you know?

126
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,550
So, are all of them your online friends?

127
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,510
But even the tone you're using
is the same as him.

128
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,110
Especially when
you're criticizing Mr Jiang.

129
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,950
He's bothering Jiang Yu Cheng as well?

130
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,820
You can introduce him to me then.

131
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,390
What exactly are you trying to say?

132
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,350
Mr Zhou Chuan,

133
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,870
you're Mr Fox, right?

134
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,790
Mr Fox?

135
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,310
Who is it?

136
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,630
It's the Little Zhou Chuan
I've told you about.

137
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,360
You mean the one who's just like me?

138
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,630
You must be delusional.

139
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,270
You're saying that I'm Mr Fox
just because of the way I write?

140
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,710
Not just that,

141
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,630
the way you criticize people

142
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,910
is exactly the same as him.

143
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,350
You two are curious about
the same thing as well.

144
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,700
Just like

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,020
the entries for the
Interactive Cultural Festival.

146
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,430
Now, you're using the tone
of my writing as evidence?

147
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,990
You should listen to yourself.
It's absurd.

148
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,510
I'm one of the authors for
the Interactive Cultural Festival.

149
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,430
Isn't it normal for me

150
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,430
to care about the amount of entries?

151
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,550
As for that Mr Fox,

152
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,540
I think he's curious because

153
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,070
he's one of my readers.

154
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,870
You can call Mr Fox right now.

155
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,070
Ask him if he is me.

156
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,590
[Please don't make the call.]

157
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,590
[Please.]

158
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,270
[Please.]

159
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,870
Mr Zhou Chuan,

160
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,670
are you not Mr Fox?

161
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,720
Didn't I give you a chance
to prove it to me?

162
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,310
Forget about it.
I'll take it as a no then.

163
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,970
I won't dwell on this anymore.

164
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,830
[What a relief.]

165
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,420
I have to endure this every day?

166
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,820
My heart won't be able to take it
any longer.

167
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,950
Why are you staring at me?

168
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,360
Of course I can't admit that I'm Mr Fox.

169
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,070
I wasn't honest with her from the start.

170
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,620
What should I do if she knew that

171
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,880
I was trying to get information from her?

172
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,230
Mr Fox is me at my geekiest moment.

173
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,780
If she knew that I was Mr Fox,

174
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,830
what if she threatens me

175
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,630
and wants me

176
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,430
to hand over my copyright to her?

177
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,910
Enough already.

178
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,640
I know she won't resort to this.

179
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,950
But I'm sure she'll tease me for it.

180
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,980
I can imagine her face

181
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,350
when she teases me.

182
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,350
"Mr Zhou Chuan."

183
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,430
"I didn't expect you

184
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,690
to be such an emotional teen in the past."

185
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,110
What if she threatens me with that

186
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,840
and doesn't want to cook for us?

187
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,950
I'm fine with that.

188
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,670
But can you change from

189
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,200
eating freshly made dishes
to dried dog food?

190
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,470
That's why.

191
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,790
I can't admit it for your sake.

192
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,430
Let's not dwell on it anymore.

193
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,290
I will never admit that I'm Mr Fox.

194
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,190
Let's go.

195
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,470
Let's go.

196
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,370
[Moonlight]

197
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,350
Good morning, Mr Jiang.

198
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,620
Morning.

199
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,790
Are you here for the latest issue
of Moonlight Magazine?

200
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,390
Yes.

201
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,310
Count this as my present for you.

202
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,100
Thank you.

203
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,230
Compared with the fan fictions
on Xin Dun Creative Exchange,

204
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,820
seems like this issue's
Interactive Cultural Festival

205
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,070
focuses more on

206
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,710
promoting new authors.

207
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,150
I guess all of the articles
are specially chosen.

208
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,070
That's what Mr Xia thought of.

209
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,390
He wants to guide the newcomers
as a veteran.

210
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,190
He wants more people to know about
the new authors.

211
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,550
By the way,

212
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,990
all of your articles

213
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,660
were specially picked by me.

214
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,070
What do you think?
I did a good job, right?

215
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,270
I have nothing to fear when you're here.

216
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,870
By the way,

217
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,350
I've rewritten the ending for

218
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,280
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

219
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,070
Are you free tomorrow night?

220
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,190
I wish to discuss it with you.

221
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,910
Of course. You wrote another ending to it?

222
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,030
Mr Jiang, you're really amazing.

223
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,390
So, am I the first reader

224
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,630
of this new ending?

225
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,350
Please remember to send the location
and time to me.

226
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,550
I need to leave now.

227
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,910
I have a meeting to attend to.

228
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,470
Alright.

229
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,670
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

230
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,590
Hello?

231
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,590
Please reserve two spots
with the best view for me.

232
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,510
For two.

233
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,270
For the Interactive Cultural Festival,

234
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,630
no matter it's from the entries

235
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,430
or the response of the readers,

236
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,070
they're the best we've achieved
for the past two years.

237
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,430
We need to thank our leader for this.

238
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,350
He has been fully supporting us for this.

239
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,550
But, there are some problems
regarding the festival as well.

240
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,670
For the authors,

241
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,190
their popularity vary greatly.

242
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,310
Everyone knows that

243
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,150
the current publishing field

244
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,390
isn't doing too well.

245
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,550
I think we can use this chance

246
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,990
to cut down on our number of authors.

247
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,750
All of the authors included

248
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,070
have a sturdy fanbase.

249
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,670
Their popularity

250
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,270
is largely determined by the situation.

251
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,830
For example, for Mr Zhou Chuan
and Mr Jiang Yu Cheng

252
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,030
Their fans are more active

253
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,590
on social media.

254
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,430
That's why they may seem more popular.

255
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,590
But for some authors,

256
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,460
their readers are more mature.

257
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,870
They keep a low profile as well.

258
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,950
Although they may not express themselves
on social media,

259
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,390
it doesn't mean that the authors
are not popular.

260
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,950
You're saying that they're popular?

261
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,910
If that's so, why are people

262
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,510
faking data for them

263
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,590
behind the scenes?

264
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,070
Chief Editor Yu,

265
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,430
I'm sure you know who I'm talking about.

266
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,630
It's Suo Heng.

267
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,470
Everyone knows the amount of letter

268
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,150
Suo Heng had received this time,
am I right?

269
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,730
Five letters in total.

270
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,580
According to our data,

271
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,830
why is the second section

272
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,470
keeping an unpopular author like her?

273
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,610
Do you think she's our mascot?

274
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,230
Mr Liang,

275
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,230
Ms Suo Heng has been writing
for Moonlight Magazine for a decade.

276
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,430
You can't just judge her capability

277
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,790
based on an activity like this.

278
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,150
Actually, the managing editor

279
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,270
has been reminding
Ms Suo Heng of her situation.

280
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,710
It's just that the results
aren't that positive.

281
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,840
You guys are seeing it for yourselves.

282
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,790
I was the one who brought Suo Heng
to our publishing house.

283
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,310
It's heartbreaking

284
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,740
for me to say this,

285
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,190
but I have to say it

286
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,810
for the sake of the publishing house.

287
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,990
In my opinion,

288
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,390
we should fire

289
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,990
unpopular authors like her.

290
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,110
We should leave spaces

291
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,670
for authors who are more worthy.

292
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,030
This is a publishing house.

293
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,070
We aren't doing charity over here.

294
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,470
There's no need for us to support

295
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,550
the losers in life,

296
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,630
am I right?

297
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,900
Losers?

298
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,990
Miao,

299
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,390
you think this has
nothing to do with you at all?

300
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,790
Chief Editor Yu,

301
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,310
we are in a meeting, you know?

302
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,750
There's no need for you to
confront me directly.

303
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,190
Unpopular authors like Suo Heng
should've been

304
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,780
eliminated long ago.

305
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,630
It's been so many years, you know?
Do you think other publishing houses

306
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,790
are still publishing her works?

307
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,990
If it weren't for your support,

308
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,750
she wouldn't have been able to stay with

309
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,310
Yuan Yue Publishing House
for so many years.

310
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:41,830
Miao.

311
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,910
Chief Editor Yu,

312
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,350
I know you've been asking other people
to write Suo Heng's stories for her.

313
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,710
Director Yang was unhappy

314
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,390
when he found out about it.

315
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,830
I tried my best to defend you, you know?

316
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,510
Yet, you're still unwilling to give up?

317
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,510
That's it. It's decided then.

318
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,390
If anyone has objections,

319
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,320
you can complain to Director Yang.

320
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,420
Sir,

321
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,190
I've prepared steam rice rolls with
BBQ pork for your lunch.

322
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,680
Steam rice rolls with BBQ pork?

323
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,190
Where is it?

324
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,910
Er Gou!

325
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,230
You're complaining to me about Er Gou?

326
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,990
Come back home immediately

327
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,900
and prepare another set
of steamed rice rolls for me.

328
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,100
Brother, can't you
please call for deliveries

329
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,420
using your phone?

330
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,350
Why do you sound so down?

331
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,470
I'll hang up now. Bye.

332
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,950
Chu Li, Ms Suo Heng

333
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,630
looks pale.

334
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,430
I feel like she's going
to faint at any time.

335
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,110
Fine.

336
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,510
Both of you are trying to
make me angry, huh?

337
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,710
You won't get to eat your favourite
chicken meatballs,

338
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,590
you hear me?

339
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,270
Don't tell me she realized that

340
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,190
I was Mr Fox after last night?

341
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,150
Mr Fox didn't reply her the entire night.

342
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,110
That won't do.

343
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,390
How should I reply her?

344
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,370
[The Ghostwriters Hired by the Monkey]

345
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,350
What are you doing?

346
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,350
No.

347
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,190
This sounds just like me.

348
00:18:50,530 --> 00:19:00,470
[The Ghostwriters Hired by the Monkey]

349
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,150
Good morning.

350
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,430
Today will be a great day.

351
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,640
Let's see if you still suspect me
as Mr Fox after this.

352
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,350
Deputy Editor Miao.

353
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,230
You must be kidding me, right?

354
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,320
Yuan Yue Publishing House and I

355
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,710
have been working together
for so many years.

356
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,790
How could you terminate
my contract just like that?

357
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,500
We had no choice.

358
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,110
We tried to fight for you,

359
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,430
but

360
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,790
this is a decision made by the higher-ups.

361
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,850
We didn't want this to happen either.

362
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,110
Deputy Editor Miao, look.

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,300
I still have more than

you asked of me.

366

I was always trying to be creative.

367
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,190
I'm not lying.

368
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,580
I tried my best to be creative.

369
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,950

As long as you guys don't give up on me.

373
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,030
Suo Heng,

374
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,150
didn't I tell you already?

375
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,150
Regarding these scripts,

376
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,860
since we've worked together

377
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,030
for so many years,

378
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,910
let me

379
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,900
be honest with you.

380
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,280
You're not suitable

381
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,420
for writing.

382
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,870
It's better for you to find another job.

383
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,190
He said he's being honest with her?

384
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,310
He's stabbing Ms Suo Heng's gentle heart

385
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,350
with a spear.

386
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,270
I've spent the most precious decade
of my life

387
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,030
on writing.

388
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,950
I try my best

389
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,190
to write every day.

390
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,560
I was thinking that even if
I wasn't talented as a writer,

391
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,950
my hard work will be able to
compensate for my lack of talent.

392
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,390
I don't want my career to end like this.

393
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,670
I can't accept this.

394
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,230
You can't accept this?

395
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,460
Even so, you can't just let

397

I understand now.

398
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,490
I understand everything.

399
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,030
Great, I'm glad that you understood me.

400
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,990
Let's part with a smile then.

401

And that'll be all.

I can't accept this!

405
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,510
Miao, you better don't be too much!

406
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,190
Aren't you being too anxious?

407
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,030
Why are you here?

408
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,690
You have no say in this matter!

409
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,870
Ms Suo Heng's novels

410
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,870
were great.

411
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,910
Every writer has their own style

412
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,870
and themes they're good at.

413
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,550
Things wouldn't have ended like this

414
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,230
if you didn't force her
to change her style.

415
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,030
I forced her to change her style?

416
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,790
Tell me, should all writers

417
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,470
stay in their comfort zone then?

418
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,270
I just wanted her to make a breakthrough.

419
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,390
But she couldn't make it.

420
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,910
How could you blame this on me?

421
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,950
Is asking her to write something
she isn't good at

422
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,510
an attempt for her to make a breakthrough?

423
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,870
If you love to help her out so much,

424
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,110
why don't you write it for her then?

425
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,150
Enough!

that's been going on.

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,760

I know all of that.
I knew what was going on.

I don't need you guys to take pity on me!

I'm sure there's a solution to this.

I can only say that

456
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,350
I really had no choice back then.

457

I want steamed rice rolls with BBQ pork.

What's wrong?

502
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,310
It's all because of Ms Suo Heng.

503
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,870
She received too less replies from
the Interactive Cultural Festival.

504
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,310
That's why Director Yang
is terminating her contract.

505
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,460
Even if Suo Heng couldn't make it,

506
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,990
Yu Yao is still there for her.

507
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,650
Why are you worried about her?

508
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,160
Even you know her relationship
with Chief Editor Yu?

509
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,870
I know a little bit.

510
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,070
Isn't Ms Suo Heng pitiful

511
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,910
if Chief Editor Yu

512
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,830
were to ignore her as well?

513
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,310
So, what has this got to do with you?

514
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,480
Why has it got nothing to do with me?

515
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,670
Miao said so before.
Even you are saying the same thing.

516
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,390
But I'm an editor.

517
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,990
As an editor,

518
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,430
how could I watch and do nothing

519
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,400
as a talented writer

520
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,430
fades away?

521
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,750
This concerns my professionalism.

522
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,070
If I failed after I've done my best,

523
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,990
I won't say anything.

524
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,070
But if I keep quiet about it

525
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,460
and pretend to be ignorant
because it doesn't concern me,

526
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,590
I will never be able to forgive myself.

527
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,390
As long as I'm working as an editor,

528
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,470
I will never give up on any author.

529
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,820
That's why I became an editor
in the first place.

530
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,390
What if, one day,

531
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,910
I run out of ideas?

532
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,470
I will never give up on you as well.

533
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,100
Incorrect. You should've said,

534
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,590
"Mr Zhou Chuan, it's impossible for you

535
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,310
to run out of ideas?"

536
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,340
So,

537
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,710
the talented, handsome,

538
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,550
and resourceful Mr Zhou Chuan,

539
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,430
do you know where
Ms Suo Heng is staying at?

540
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,230
You think I'm the paparazzi?

541
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,220
Let's go.

542
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,430
What are you doing?

543
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,960
Are you removing the BBQ pork
because you want to give them to me?

544
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,790
You said you love BBQ pork, right?

545
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,450
I'm giving them to you just in case
you want more.

546
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,150
You're doing all of this

547
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,350
just because you want to
find out her address?

548
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,110
Waiter,

549
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,340
give me another set of BBQ pork.

550
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,910
Alright.

551
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,230
How could you say that about me?

552
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,190
Do you think I'm being nice to you
just because of that?

553
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,630
Ever since I came to know you,

554
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,580
I've been serving you every day, you know?

555
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,270
Where can you find another

556
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,190
cute and bubbly editor like me?

557
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,470
I've sent Suo Heng's address to you.

558
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,990
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

559
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,630
I'll go and find her tonight.

560
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,610
I hope you still remember that
you're my editor.

561
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,550
Eat up.

562
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,390
-Sorry for being late.
-You became prettier.

563
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,230
Come.

564
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,310
I saw that your daughter has
given birth to a girl.

565
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,940
Congratulations.

566
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,340
Yeah, congratulations.

567
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,110
Not bad at all.

568
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,030
You were a tomboy in the past.

569
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,070
Yet you got married the fastest
among all of us.

570
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,740
Now,

571
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,230
I'm a housewife who had just given birth
to my second daughter.

572
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,790
I was so busy that

573
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,950
I can't even finish a book.

574
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,310
I wanted to be a writer
in the past, you know?

575
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,270
But, I realized that

576
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,150
I can't make a living

577
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,150
with just writing novels.

578
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,230
That's why

579
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,580
I joined the sales industry.

580
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,510
This is a rich wife's life.

581
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,240
Yeah, no one can compare to her.

582
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,420
Suo Heng,

583
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,590
I heard that you've written
several novels.

584
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,150
Share them with us.

585
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,140
Yeah, the hottest novel right now
is The Fierce West Wind.

586
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,910
Did you write it?

587
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,830
-The Fierce West Wind?
-Yeah.

588
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,780
It's quite good.

589
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,910
You'll earn a lot if
you turn novels into movies.

590
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,060
Suo Heng, tell us about it.

591
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,150
How much do you earn from
selling your novels?

592
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,630
I don't earn that much.

593
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,030
-Just tell us about it.
-That can't be.

594
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,220
Why are you asking about her income

595
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,230
when we're here to have a meal?

596
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,940
Why do I feel like you have some
ulterior motives?

597
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,740
Not at all. I'm just trying to
show concern for her.

598
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,580
Come, it's been a long time
since we've met.

599
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,390
Let's have a toast.

600
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,910
-Come on.
-Come on.

601
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,980
That person who's been
enjoying himself abroad,

602
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,150
you have to drink three cups.

603
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,390
Bottoms up.

604
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,120
He's living his life right now.

605
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,950
Ms Suo Heng!

606
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,070
Are you okay?

607
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,390
Why are you here?

608
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,660
Did you drink?

609
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,150
I've terminated my contract
with Yuan Yue Publishing House.

610
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,190
I have no ties with your company anymore.

611
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,120
Don't come and look for me anymore.

612
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,510
What about your pills?

613
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,110
Ms Suo Heng,

614
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,640
you mustn't give up on
writing just like that.

615
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,910
Don't you think

616
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,710
you're being sarcastic

617
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,570
when you're working for
Yuan Yue Publishing House?

618
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,030
Chu Li, I've seen everything
you've done for me.

619
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,890
Thank you for everything.

620
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,410
Director Yang.

621
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,780
Director Yang, I need to speak with you.

622
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,110
Director Yang, I need to speak with you.

623
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,230
Chief Editor Yu?

624
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,800
What a coincidence.

625
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,070
Do you need anything?

626
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,390
I have something to
report to Director Yang.

627
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,910
Director Yang and I had
a happy time tonight.

628
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,430
He drank a lot.

629
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,070
He has fallen asleep.

630
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,710
Why don't you try to wake him up?

631
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,590
Come.

632
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,270
Director Yang,

633
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,030
Suo Heng...

634
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,960
As long as she regains confidence,

635
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,110
as long as she returns to her expertise,

636
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,990
I'm sure she can write
another great novel like

637
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,220
Golden Spears and Armoured Horses

638
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,710
She isn't worthless.

639
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,510
Yeah.

640
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,590
You do have a point.

641
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,550
Chief Editor Yu,

642
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,970

643
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,210
Have a piece of chocolate.

644

645
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,710
Director Yang, please give
Suo Heng another chance.

646

647
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,950
Director Yang,

648
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,010
please give Suo Heng another chance!

649
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,350
Hello?

650
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,790
Dear?

651
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,830
I'm sorry.

652
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,590
I might not be able to

653
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,650
attend Mum's birthday dinner later.

654
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,430
Please apologize to her for me.

655
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,310
Wish her happy birthday for me.

656
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,370
I'll surely apologize to her personally
in the future.

657
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,270
Mum, let's proceed.

658
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,550
She's busy tonight.

659
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,680
She won't be coming.

660
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,070
She was already busy with her work.

661
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,270
She had never brought Qiu Qiu

662
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,710
to visit us.

663
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,090
Now, she was finally
transferred back here.

664
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,940
I thought our family

665
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,670
can have a happy meal together.

666
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,110
Coincidentally,

667
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,150
today is my 60th birthday.

668
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,950
We waited until now,

669
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,760
yet she's telling us that
she won't be coming?

670
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,070
I'm sure Yao Yao has an emergency
to attend to.

671
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,200
I'll apologize to you on behalf of her.

672

for Grandma later.

678
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,110
Let's go and buy some fruits.

679
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,630

That's a restricted medication.

685

You need to get them from the hospitals.

686
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,990
What kind of medication is this?

687
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,590
It's a strong sleeping pill.

I'm afraid something might happen to her.

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,070
What are you guys saying?

728
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,570
[Estazolam Pills]

729
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,110
I'm not trying to kill myself.

730
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,590
It's just that I couldn't sleep lately.

731
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,710
That's why I'm taking the sleeping pills.

732
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,070
I didn't expect myself to
fall into a deep sleep.

733
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,710
Did you drink just now?

734
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,910
Alcohol might strengthen the effects
of sleeping pills.

735
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,550
I'm glad that you're fine.

736
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,430
How did you guys come in?

737
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,830
Chief Editor Yu...

738
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,140
I've always kept your keys with me.

739
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,940
I was the one who opened the door.

740
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,550
So,

741
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,350
since she's fine,

742
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,810
I'll wait for you outside.

743
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,510
Do you still find it hard

744
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,470
to sleep lately?

745
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,430
Your body will be damaged
if you keep taking sleeping pills.

746
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,760
You need to see a doctor.

747
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,470
I know a great doctor.

748
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,290
I don't need you to care for me.

749
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,290
Even doctors won't be able to save me.

750
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,710
I know my own condition the best.

751
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,630
I'm fine right now.

752
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,390
Please leave.

753
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,790
Ms Suo Heng,

754
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,590
Chief Editor Yu has always
been concerned for you.

755
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,590
So,

756
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,470
I think we'll leave now.

757
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,670
If you need anything,

758
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,750
you can call Chu Li.

759
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,680
Take good care of yourself.

760
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,900
Ms Suo Heng,

761
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,510
we didn't give up on you.

762
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,750
If you're willing,

763
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,510
I can be your editor...

764
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,940
Even Yuan Yue Publishing House
won't be able to save me.

765
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,270
Stop worrying about me.

766
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,770
You guys should leave.

767
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,270
-Let's go.
-Wait.

768
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,860
Leave the keys here.

769
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,190
Is there anything else?

770
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,430
Tearing your own scripts into pieces,

771
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,570
I've done that before.

772
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,390
But, it's useless.

773
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,390
Because every word that you've written

774
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,270
will be imprinted in your mind.

775
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,110
If you can't even accept your past self,

776
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,360
you have no right
to talk about the future.

777
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,920
Do you think I still can
expect something from my future?

778
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,670
No matter for what reason,

779
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,750
you didn't take the entire bottle tonight.

780
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,350
That means you're still
expecting something.

781
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,150
What's the use of expectations?

782
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,550
This is just my last struggle.

783
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,840
Why don't you have a try?

784
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,990
Today, my editor told me that

785
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,830
as long as she's working as an editor,

786
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,560
she won't give up on any author.

787
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,140
That's why she became an editor
in the first place.

788
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,190
She can accept it when she fails

789
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,430
after trying her best,

790
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,310
but she can't accept it when

791
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,570
she submits to fate without even trying.

792
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,060
That's because you're lucky.

793
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,510
You got yourself a great editor.

794
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,510
That's precisely why

795
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,830
you should give her

796
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,270
and yourself another chance.

797
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,990
It's all because of me.

798
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,910
I was the one

799
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,630
who pushed her into this plight.

800
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,350
I was the reason

801
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:30,030
she couldn't sleep without taking
sleeping pills.

802
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,820
Do you know

803
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,190
why she ended up like this?

804
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,950
It's because I gave up on her before.

805
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,190
It'll be inconvenient for me
to visit you from now on.

806
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,720
You can take the keys first.

807
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,460
You're not visiting me anymore?

808
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,670
Even you are giving up on me?

809
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,350
It's not that. I...

810
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,950
I need to take a long break.

811
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,990
In the future, I'll ask

812
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,310
the other editors

813
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,590
to take care of you.

814
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,640
What do you mean by that?

815
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,950
Are you saying that you're abandoning me?

816
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,070
Is it because no one is buying my book?

817
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,510
Is that why you're abandoning me as well?

818
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,190
I don't know how to
explain it to you right now,

819
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,470
but,

820
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,870
Suo Heng, I'm sorry.

821
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,750
I didn't expect you

822
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,990
to deviate from your original style

823
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,550
after you did your research

824
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,870
on how to write better.

825
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,470
Maybe it's my fault.

826
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,470
Sis Yao Yao,

827
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,750
can you please trust me one last time?

828
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,390
Please trust me one last time, okay?

829
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,430
Fine.

830
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,070
I understand now.

831
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,590
Thank you for caring for me
all these years.

832
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,590
From now on,
we'll be on our separate ways.

833
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,750
We are even now.

834
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,790
I was so naive that I thought

835
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,210
the dreams you told me before
were your true dreams.

836
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,870
Just throw away the keys.

837
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,390
Chief Editor Yu,

838
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,940
why didn't you tell her that...

839
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,110
Because

840
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,790
I was pregnant back then.

841
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,150
The doctor said

842
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,790
it'll be hard for the child to survive

843
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,620
if I didn't rest well.

844
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,110
Why didn't you tell her then?

845
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,760
Even if I had told her,
that wouldn't have changed anything.

846
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,150
Even if I had told tell her that

847
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,810
I didn't want to give up on her,

848
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,070
what would have that changed?

849
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,230
It won't change anything.

850
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,470
I'm sorry, Chief Editor Yu.

851
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,270
Stop it.

852
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,520
You're not the one
who should apologize here.

853
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,350
Sorry for that.

854
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,120
I have things to attend to.
I'll leave now.

855
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,390
Chu Li,

856
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,070
let's go.

857
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,870
It's fine as long as she's alive.

858
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,350
If you want her to pull herself together,

859
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,010
you'll have plenty of time to do so
in the future.

860
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,390
I watched Ms Suo Heng

861
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,790
as she couldn't say anything

862
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,050
or do anything about her circumstances.

863
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,180
She worked so hard,

864
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,380
even the ink of her keyboard has faded.

865
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,590
In this world,

866
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,470
there are many helpless situations.

867
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,270
Your effort might not be repaid.

868
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,910
But, if you can move on bravely

869
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,710
even after realizing the truth,

870
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,830
these difficulties you've faced

871
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,350
won't become ordeals to you.

872
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,270
They'll become a meaningful experience

873
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,950
to you.

874
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,670
Sir, I'm sorry.

875
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,750
Did I mention your sad past by accident?

876
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,830
I'm different from you.

877
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,260
I'm a genius.

878
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,320
Geniuses don't need to put in effort.

879
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,230
Your confidence is what I like about you.

880
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,470
Let's go.
