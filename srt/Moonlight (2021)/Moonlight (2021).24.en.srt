If I had known that,

443
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,310

to wipe the table?

The "Little Deity" series

571
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,830
is very popular.

572
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,150
Mr Xia got her

573
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,430

The minimum number is 10,000,

577
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,150
but it's a new beginning

578
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,820
for Suo Heng.

579
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,670

580

It's not a lengthy book.

Maybe I'll bring Yun Fei.

with Director Lu.

604

She is so into her work.

744
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,950
Aren't people in love

745
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,870
always want to be with each other?

746
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,510
You won't cherish it when you get it.

747
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,310
Don't always speak like an old lady.

748
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,310
I think you are too free.

749
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,900
I am doing my laundry, I am not free.

750
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,120
You didn't add any laundry detergent.

751
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,460
And this is not washing your clothes.

752
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,920
This is throwing clothes.

753
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,310
The one

754
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,640
doing the laundry is me.

755
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,910
It's only a washing machine.

756
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,430
People may think

757
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,950
you lifted Thor's hammer.

758
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,790
If I can lift it up,

759
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,110
I'll kill you first.

760
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,150
Single men are always like this.

761
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,670
When you see a lovely couple

762
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,330
you are full of dark thoughts.

763
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,750
Is your relationship different

764
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,270
from that of a single man?
