00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,970
[Moonlight]

3
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 33]

4
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,950
I'm back.

5
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,229
Er Gou.

6
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,870
Do you miss me?

7
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,870
It's six. She should be home already.

8
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,500
Come, Er Gou.

9
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,260
Come and greet him.

10
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,830
[How are you today?]

11
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,920
Why is your face bigger than
Er Gou's face?

12
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,550
[It's not.]

13
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,430
[Now, my face looks slim, right?]

14
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,030
I've watched your dad's interview.

15
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,670
[Now, some people online are]

16
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,500
starting to believe that you are innocent.

17
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,560
It's impossible for your dad
to write the novel for you.

18
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,510
Those are the minority.

19
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,950
The majority of them
are more willing to believe that

20
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,430
my dad is just covering up for me.

21
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,110
Now, they even call him

22
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,430
the fallen literary magnate.

23
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,560
I don't know what else they'll call me.

24
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,390
The reputation that he has built
his whole life

25
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,630
is almost destroyed by me.

26
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,829
[Don't think like that.]

27
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,950
[At first, I thought that
we could solve the issue]

28
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,390
by asking Old Mr Zhou to give a statement.

29
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,990
I never thought that those haters

30
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,910
would turn things upside down like this.

31
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,830
They are blind to the truth.

32
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,870
[Let's not talk about me anymore.]

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,430
[How are you over there?]

34
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,710
Let me tell you. I'm so furious.

35
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,830
Miao has joint hands with
Luo Wen from Xin Dun.

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,670
[He's going to take away
all of our authors.]

37
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,790
[Besides, I suspect that]

38
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,070
Miao is that anonymous whistle-blower.

39
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,829
Miao Jian Ping?

40
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,950
I'm not surprised.

41
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,980
But it's okay.

42
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,070
We'll definitely be able
to find a solution for it.

43
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,230
The truth will be revealed one day.

44
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,270
Spend more time with your parents.

45
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,460
[Okay?]

46
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,590
Why are you talking like my mum?

47
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,110
[I don't want to be your mum.]

48
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,800
[Who do you want to be then?]

49
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,110
[The mother to my child?]

50
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,990
What are you talking about?
I'm going to hang up now.

51
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,270
[Wait.]

52
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,670
I miss you.

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,590
Er Gou misses you too.

54
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,590
[Here he is.]

55
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,150
Wait for me.

56
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,230
Old Zhou.

57
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,030
What is it?

58
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,950
I thought you were going to
give him the fruits.

59
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,910
Why do they look untouched?

60
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,390
I think our son has a girlfriend.

61
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,550
They are

62
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,910
chatting so sweetly upstairs.

63
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,910
Impossible.

64
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,310
Who will like someone like him?

65
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,670
He's so childish.

66
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,430
Listen to yourself.

67
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,910
Do you hope that

68
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,950
your son will be alone forever?

69
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,260
Who do you think that girl is?

70
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,710
Could she be the editor

71
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,630
who exposed the information?

72
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,540
You...

73
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,230
I'll go to my study room now.

74
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,640
[Closed]

75
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,710
It's morning already?

76
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,960
You've been awake for
the whole night, right?

77
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,390
Yes.

78
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm almost done now.

79
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,430
I'll send it to you after I'm done.

80
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,230
And you can give it to Zhou Chuan.

81
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,670
Okay.

82
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,350
Here you go.

83
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,350
You fell asleep like this yesterday.

84
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,740
You might catch a cold.

85
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,380
Take some medicine.

86
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,550
Chu Li, Xiao Niao.

87
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,990
How is it? Any progress?

88
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,790
What did the authors say?

89
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,950
Xiao Niao and I have managed to
persuade Mr He Ma.

90
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,870
He has agreed to come here.

91
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,220
Although

92
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,950
other authors are tempted,

93
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,670
we are not sure how many will come here.

94
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,500
Don't worry.

95
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,510
He Ma is quite prestigious among them.

96
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,510
If he's willing to come back,

97
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,340
others will come back too.

98
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,590
No matter what, you've worked hard.

99
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,470
Chief Editor Yu.

100
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,190
Before this, I didn't tell you about

101
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,070
Miao's intent to take away our authors.

102
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,630
Will you blame me?

103
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,390
I understand.

104
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,430
It's hard to choose
between family and work.

105
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,670
But there won't be next time.

106
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,950
Thank you, Chief Editor Yu.

107
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,270
First,

108
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,860
I'm very thankful that
all of you are willing to

109
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,500
come to Yuan Yue Publishing House
despite your busy schedule.

110
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,430
I would like to apologise to you.

111
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,760
Let me introduce you to him.

112
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,030
He is

113
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,550
Liang Chong Lang, Mr Liang from
the circulation department.

114
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,150
I've heard about you.

115
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,820
Fellow authors,

116
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,110
first and foremost,

117
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,750
I would like to explain about

118
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,030
the previous statement.

119
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,750
Stop. No need to explain.

120
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,390
Allow me to interrupt.

121
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,790
Before this,

122
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,910
I don't really have a liking
for Zhou Chuan,

123
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,830
but,

124
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,950
the statement that was made by

125
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,590
the circulation department from Yuan Yue

126
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,270
has really shocked me.

127
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,150
As soon as the author fell into trouble,

128
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,070
you immediately cast him off.

129
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,660
That was really quick.

130
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,030
I think this is a misunderstanding.

131
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,230
This is Yuan Yue Publishing House's

132
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,159
public relations crisis control.

133
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,789
We had to calm down the readers first.

134
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,470
And then, we'll find a solution

135
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,470
to solve the problem for Zhou Chuan.

136
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,510
That's it.

137
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,670
Yuan Yue

138
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,030
had indeed dealt with it badly.

139
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,230
Mr Liang has already
discussed with our superiors

140
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,350
to take down that statement.

141
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,790
The editorial department will continue

142
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,430
to support our authors as usual.

143
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,190
I think

144
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,630
you are only taking it down because

145
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,830
the issue has escalated quickly.

146
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,310
That's right.

147
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,190
It's too late for you

148
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,590
to do damage control now.

149
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,790
I'm really disappointed.

150
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,150
I can't trust you.

151
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,630
My fellow authors.

152
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,470
Long time no see.

153
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,470
Mr Xia.

154
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,830
Come. Take a seat.

155
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,430
Why are you here?

156
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,310
Mr Xia is on a sick leave.

157
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,220
But he said that

158
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,750
he has to come here to
meet all of you today.

159
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,270
First, I want to say that

160
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,350
I'm not here today

161
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,020
to force you to stay.

162
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,950
At this age,

163
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,150
hellos and goodbyes

164
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,030
no longer matter much to me.

165
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,350
I just want to say that

166
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,510
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

167
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,670
me,

168
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,070
Mr Xia,

169
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,780
and our editorial department

170
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,430
have never thought about

171
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,750
giving up on Zhou Chuan.

172
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,150
Those are just rumours.

173
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,470
Not the truth.

174
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,870
Similarly,

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,030
as long as our authors
don't give up on us,

176
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,030
Yuan Yue Publishing House

177
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,950
will always be

178
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,270
your strongest shield.

179
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,430
Mr He Ma.

180
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,590
Mr Xia.

181
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,070
How long have we been working together?

182
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,150
Fifteen years.

183
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,590
I still remember that

184
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,830
you are the one
who accepted my first draft.

185
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,510
I'll never forget about

186
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,910
the kindness and help that
you've given me.

187
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,110
Sentiments tie us together.

188
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,350
But your work

189
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,220
is the foundation of Yuan Yue.

190
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,930
Yuan Yue and I are only successful

191
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,990
because of you.

192
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,630
Without you,

193
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,140
Yuan Yue is nothing.

194
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,190
So, I hope that

195
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,350
all of you here

196
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,300
can give us another chance.

197
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,620
Believe in us again.

198
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,990
Thank you.

199
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,670
We hope you won't

200
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,660
let anyone instigate you.

201
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,550
We really cherish

202
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,910
our collaboration with all of you.

203
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,110
Please believe in us.

204
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,870
These are the new contracts that

205
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,350
we've prepared for you.

206
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,030
I hope that you can feel

207
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,510
our sincerity.

208
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,830
It's thanks to all of you today that

209
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,230
the authors have decided to
come back to us.

210
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,990
We still have to rely on

211
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,850
Mr Xia during this critical time.

212
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,710
No wonder Director Yang always says that

213
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,830
you are Yuan Yue Publishing House's
anchor.

214
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,390
Liang.

215
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,550
You really have to

216
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,310
reflect on your action this time.

217
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,830
I'm no longer young.

218
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,590
Sooner or later, Yuan Yue Publishing House

219
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,990
will be entrusted to you.

220
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,680
I hope that through this incident,

221
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,350
you can understand better

222
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,590
the relationship between
the authors and Yuan Yue.

223
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,350
Yes. I know.

224
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,990
About Chu Li's issue...

225
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,670
I've already settled that.

226
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,990
Don't worry.

227
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,030
Since it has already been settled,

228
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,140
-can I continue...
-Wait.

229
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,780
You look quite energetic.

230
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,230
It's time to

231
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,910
end your leave earlier.

232
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,950
Mr Xia, what I was going to say is,

233
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,070
I'm going to get back to my work now.

234
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,660
I'll get back to my work now.

235
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,390
Mr Xia, I'll take my leave too.

236
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,830
Chu Li.

237
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,850
Zhou Chuan has gone back
to his home town, right?

238
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,510
He must have suffered from this.

239
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,070
But,

240
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,020
hardship can make you stronger.

241
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,510
It's not a bad thing for young people

242
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,270
to go through more hardships.

243
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,950
But Mr Xia,

244
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,670
this incident has greatly affected

245
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,950
Mr Zhou Chuan.

246
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,460
The public

247
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,990
is still attacking both
him and his father.

248
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,860
They've already set their mind.

249
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,670
They chose to ignore
the circumstantial evidence and witness.

250
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,830
We need to find a concrete evidence

251
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,900
to convince them.

252
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,430
I've contacted Shu Hua for you.

253
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,860
He'll conduct an interview

254
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,390
with Zhou Chuan next Tuesday.

255
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,850
It'll be a live broadcast.

256
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,830
It'll give Zhou Chuan a chance

257
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,710
to prove himself.

258
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,220
He said that he's doing this

259
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,790
out of respect for me.

260
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,710
But he won't

261
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,110
change his standing.

262
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,140
So, use this remaining time

263
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,870
to find a more concrete evidence.

264
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,070
Thank you, Mr Xia.

265
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,670
Go and help your author.

266
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,390
Don't worry.

267
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,790
Mr Luo, looking at Xin Dun's scale,

268
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,790
I can tell that you are
a charismatic person.

269
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,790
Miao.

270
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,150
When you come to Xin Dun,

271
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,990
your office will be right beside mine.

272
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,310
I'll have to work harder then

273
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,370
since I'll be working beside my boss.

274
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,150
I have to take this call.

275
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,480
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Please wait for a while.

276
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,820
Hello?

277
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,390
What?

278
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,830
Really?

279
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,990
What's wrong, Mr Luo?

280
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,150
Miao Jian Ping.

281
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,710
Do you take me for a fool?

282
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,230
What's wrong?

283
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,860
How dare you ask me that.

284
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,180
Call and ask

285
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,430
those authors of yours.

286
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,630
See if they'll work with us now.

287
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,510
Impossible.

288
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,070
They have already agreed.

289
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,190
There must be a misunderstanding.

290
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,780
Calm down.

291
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,350
I'll call them now.

292
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,710
Is this a joke?

293
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,190
I've overestimated you.

294
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,820
Calm down.

295
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,670
See? The call has gone through.

296
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,830
[The number that you've dialled is busy.]

297
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,590
-[I'm sorry.]
-Why did he hang up on me?

298
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,790
Get out.

299
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,270
I'll call another author.

300
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,510
Get lost!

301
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,230
Do you know that

302
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,740
Director Lu Fang hates it the most

303
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,940
when his leading team members
make a scene online?

304
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,870
He can end the contract at any time.

305
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,070
Didn't we agree to send it to Zhou Chuan?

306
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,350
Why did you post in on Weibo instead?

307
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,270
Let Zhou Chuan post it?

308
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,710
The netizen won't necessarily
believe him if he posts it.

309
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,570
But the netizen will believe you?

310
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,390
I can't guarantee that they'll believe me.

311
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,590
But my statement is my point of view.

312
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,390
And I will not

313
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,950
back down from it.

314
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,590
Stop being mad.

315
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,510
You shared my post?

316
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,670
Zhou Chuan is my author too.

317
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,510
He's half a friend.

318
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,790
Won't it cause you any trouble?

319
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,870
Do you think there are things
that I can't handle?

320
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,310
I think

321
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,460
you've changed.

322
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,660
Changed?

323
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,570
You are so much more sentimental now.

324
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,270
That's better than being called
the Monstress

325
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,140
by Zhou Chuan behind my back.

326
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,870
It's good that you are not mad.

327
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,190
What do you want to drink?

328
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,790
The sun is still up.

329
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,770
Are you going to work
on your novel or not?

330
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,140
Why are you smiling?

331
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,030
Nothing.

332
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,270
When you nagged in the past,

333
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,150
it felt quite annoying to me.

334
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,760
Now, you are willing to nag at me again.

335
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,310
And it gives me warmth.

336
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,750
Go ahead and drink it then.

337
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,349
Thank you.

338
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,819
For what?

339
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,550
Thank you for willing to support me.

340
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,020
[Author: Jiang Yu Cheng]

341
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,390
[I grew up with Zhou Chuan since young.]

342
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,940
[I know him and his father]

343
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,550
[very well.]

344
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,590
[I don't believe in
this ghostwriting incident.]

345
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,710
[Attached is the comparison between]

346
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,110
[Zhou Chuan's and his father's writings.]

347
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,750
Thank you.

348
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,550
Son, come down to eat.

349
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,030
Coming.

350
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,990
You can't find it among the test papers?

351
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,030
No.

352
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,550
I've already arranged it.

353
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,270
Now, we still need the midterm exam paper
of year one of high school,

354
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,950
final exam paper of
year two of high school

355
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,350
and the second and third

356
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,810
mock test paper
of year three of high school.

357
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,990
Second mock test paper?

358
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,630
The second mock test paper has

359
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,070
some paragraphs and core ideas

360
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,910
of the Book of Luo He God that

361
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,910
I've added into the original version.

362
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,790
I think that test paper

363
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,070
was pasted on the bulletin board
of the school.

364
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,990
But someone tore it down.

365
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,260
What do you mean?

366
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,430
I think my deskmate will know who did it.

367
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,070
I'll go and ask him.

368
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,710
No need to be so impatient.

369
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,470
You can ask him after you eat.

370
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,550
Gu Bai Zhi.

371
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,190
I've already warned you many times

372
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,870
to control your authors

373
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,590
to stay out of Zhou Chuan's incident.

374
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,910
But what did you do?

375
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,430
You led them online

376
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,070
to publicly support Jiang Yu Cheng.

377
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,870
Do you have any respect for me?

378
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,510
Mr Luo, when we are at this position,

379
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,620
it's better to look at something
from the overall point of view.

380
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,820
What do you mean?

381
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,310
By publicly supporting Jiang Yu Cheng,

382
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,350
all of our company's authors
are pleased about that.

383
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,830
In the past few days,
our content planning department

384
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,230
had managed to sign a contract

385
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,670
with the three authors that

386
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,910
you couldn't convince
to join us before this.

387
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,140
As for you,

388
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,870
you didn't manage to sign any of them
despite your effort.

389
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,470
Everyone is watching.

390
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,990
Gu Bai Zhi,

391
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,190
don't be too arrogant.

392
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,510
Xin Dun's annual board of directors
meeting will be held soon.

393
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,990
I want to see

394
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,790
if you'll be able to keep
your position as the director.

395
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,520
Now that you say that,
I really look forward to it.

396
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,430
Surprise.

397
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,510
How is it? Are you surprised?

398
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,950
When I sent you the message,

399
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,710
I was already at the station.

400
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,070
Do you miss me?

401
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,670
I can feel your longing

402
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,350
through your hug.

403
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,070
Yuan Yue Publishing House
has already settled their crisis?

404
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,030
Yes.

405
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,590
So, I rushed here right away to see you.

406
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,270
Show me the photo.

407
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,830
What is this? It's so unclear.

408
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,150
My ex-classmate said that
this girl is probably the one who did it.

409
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,470
His cousin was in the same batch as her.

410
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,310
So, he knows her.

411
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,870
He said that she ran away
after tearing down the paper.

412
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,110
Li Xue Mei?

413
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,870
I've already asked someone to contact her.

414
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,950
I think we'll hear from her
within two days.

415
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,230
That's good.

416
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,910
Come. Let me bring you home.

417
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,260
Home?

418
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,710
I don't think that's a good idea.

419
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,510
I'm so dusty right now.

420
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,630
How about I book a hotel
to wash my hair first?

421
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,790
It'll be my first time
meeting your parents.

422
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,150
I have to give them a good impression.

423
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,030
My mum will definitely like you.

424
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,160
What about your dad?

425
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,030
If my mum like you,

426
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,710
then he'll be fine with it.

427
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,870
No.

428
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,710
I didn't prepare anything.

429
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,260
I didn't buy any presents for them.

430
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,310
The ugly bride has to meet
the parents-in-law eventually.

431
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,910
Who are you calling ugly?

432
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,630
I'm the ugly one.

433
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,590
No matter what, since you are here,

434
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,390
we should at least eat together.

435
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,870
How about this.

436
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,580
Let's use this time to buy some presents.

437
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,510
After we eat,
we'll look for a hotel together.

438
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,550
Okay?

439
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,510
Let's go.

440
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,790
Old Zhou.

441
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,070
Why isn't our son back yet?

442
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,910
Let's not wait for him then.

443
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,550
Let's eat first.

444
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,260
Dad, mum, I'm back.

445
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,020
You are back.

446
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,470
I brought someone back with me.

447
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,750
She is...

448
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,830
She is my girlfriend

449
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,180
and editor.

450
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,790
Nice to meet you. My name is Chu Li.

451
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,390
This is a little gift for you.

452
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,190
See? I said that

453
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,050
our son already has a girlfriend.

454
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,790
There's no need to bring us gift.

455
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,510
Old Mr Zhou,

456
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,970
I've heard a lot about you.

457
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,510
I'm very happy to be able
to meet you in person.

458
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,470
You can just call me

459
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,990
Uncle Zhou or Mr Zhou.

460
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,150
Okay.

461
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,140
Stop standing here. Come in.

462
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,190
Come in.

463
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,700
Chu Li.

464
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,070
You are so slim. Eat more.

465
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,550
Thank you.

466
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,030
Slim?

467
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,470
Mum.

468
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,230
You shouldn't lie.

469
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,430
Don't worry about me, aunty.

470
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,670
You should eat more too.

471
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,710
Okay.

472
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,870
Xiao Chu.

473
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,990
Xiao Chuan told me that

474
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,120
you are the Book of Luo He God's editor.

475
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,500
Yes.

476
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,350
But at that time,
we were just working partners.

477
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,220
We weren't together yet.

478
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,310
Don't be nervous.

479
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,870
You did very well for that book.

480
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,310
I can see that you had edited
the book very well.

481
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,940
I've read a few pages of the book.

482
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,390
Compared to his previous writings,

483
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,270
this book is very refined.

484
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,350
Thank you for your compliment.

485
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,070
Although it was not easy
to finish that book,

486
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,900
everything was worth it in the end.

487
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,470
Of course it was worth it.

488
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,150
I was nominated for the Huazhi Award
because of my skills.

489
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,510
Getting nominated

490
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,310
is different from winning the award.

491
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,580
Some media really like to
flatter the authors.

492
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,590
When they are doing promotion,

493
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,920
they'll give you all kinds of fancy titles

494
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,430
to exaggerate your nomination.

495
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,430
They even want to interview him.

496
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,670
In my time,

497
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,830
only real talents would be recognised.

498
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,270
Back then,

499
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,270
I was never not nominated.

500
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,260
Why didn't anyone interview me
at that time?

501
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,990
I don't know.

502
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,950
Maybe the reporters want to live longer.

503
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,790
Or else, they would be dead.

504
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,890
Don't think that you are so great now.

505
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,270
You think that you are amazing because

506
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,910
your book is nominated.

507
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,100
But remember this.

508
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,150
If it wasn't because Chu Li

509
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,910
forced you with a knife to

510
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,430
submit your work,

511
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,700
you wouldn't be

512
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,460
so successful today.

513
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,390
Chu Li didn't

514
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,150
force me to submit it with a knife.

515
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,390
She just cried.

516
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,380
At first, I didn't want to submit it.

517
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,710
I didn't want it anyway.

518
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,830
But you know.

519
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,870
Tears are an amazing weapon.

520
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,100
What are you talking about?

521
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,310
Stop acting indifferent.

522
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,190
Chu Li

523
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,150
has really contributed a lot to your book.

524
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,070
Well.

525
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,630
I'm the one who wrote it.

526
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,590
So what?

527
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,950
It's just that time is on your side.

528
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,830
In the past two years, the literary world

529
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,030
is opening up to more
new literary categories.

530
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,390
So, no matter what,

531
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,050
they'll try to nominate new novels
for the Huazhi Award this year.

532
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,670
I've read Xiao Cheng's new book too.

533
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,830
Chu Li is his editor too, right?

534
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,590
It's a fast-selling novel.

535
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,070
And his writing is very lively.

536
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,270
But time is not at his side.

537
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,420
In my opinion, if you submit his novel,

538
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,860
his novel will be nominated too.

539
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,910
Jiang Yu Cheng's first print run has

540
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,390
50,000 less than mine
even if we add in the pre-sale copies.

541
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,030
Why didn't you compliment me?

542
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,830
Enough.

543
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,150
Chu Li is still here.

544
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,350
Let's eat.

545
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,990
Let's eat.

546
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,470
Yes.

547
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,390
This is your first time here.

548
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,340
Let's cheers.

549
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,510
Come.

550
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,590
How about I tell your mum that

551
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,790
I should just stay in a hotel?

552
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,550
My mum has insisted that you stay.

553
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,550
Stop hesitating.

554
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,710
Moreover,

555
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,640
we are not staying in the same room.

556
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,230
You'll be staying in the guest room.

557
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,690
I'll go back to my room now.

558
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,990
This is your room?

559
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,550
How is it?

560
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,070
Is it different from
what you've expected?

561
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,670
Actually, it's not that different.

562
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,990
You have this book by Natsume Soseki.

563
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,830
Do you like it?

564
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,630
How about I give...

565
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,580
The teenager diary in the drawer.

566
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,840
I don't have the habit of writing a diary.

567
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,670
There should be some magazines
under your bed then.

568
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,550
I don't have that kind of magazines.

569
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,750
Impossible.

570
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,830
I'm sure you'll some CDs.

571
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,990
I'm here.

572
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,270
Why do you need a CD?

573
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,230
I just want to know more about
the younger you.

574
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,630
I was very obedient and cute.

575
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,830
Liar.

576
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,510
We are in your parents' house.

577
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,710
What if they see us?

578
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,630
I'll go back to my room first.

579
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,070
I've been worried that my son
will be alone forever

580
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,230
due to his temper.

581
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,360
I never thought that

582
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,030
he'll be able to find a girlfriend.

583
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,380
As long as he doesn't scare her away
with his temper.

584
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,670
How can you say that about your son?

585
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,230
What do you think about Chu Li?

586
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,230
I really like her.

587
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,110
After she comes here,

588
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,710
our life is no longer boring.

589
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,460
In the past few days,

590
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,430
Xiao Chuan had been so upset.

591
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,510
Today, he's smiling.

592
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,910
Since you like her,

593
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,550
what else can I say?

594
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,030
Let me send some fruits for them.

595
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,150
Why are you back?

596
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,670
They haven't seen each other
for a long time already.

597
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,390
Let's not disturb them.

598
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,360
You can't get in touch with her?

599
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,670
Time to eat breakfast.

600
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,670
Okay, I got it.

601
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,590
Okay.

602
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,740
I'll have to trouble you then.

603
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,790
Thank you.

604
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,140
What's wrong?

605
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,030
My friend said that he can't
get in touch with Li Xue Mei.

606
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,630
It's like she disappeared.

607
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,620
He can't find her phone number,

608
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,270
QQ account or WeChat.

609
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,670
Why does it sound so creepy?

610
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,070
What should we do now?

611
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,070
He found Mo Na who used to be

612
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,030
a good friend of Li Xue Mei.

613
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,810
He asked me to contact her.

614
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,050
[Assistant Song Xi]

615
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,420
This...

616
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,310
[Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.]

617
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,220
Li Xue Mei is too strange.

618
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,910
She disappeared from her social circle.

619
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,670
And now, she wants to meet you
in your previous school.

620
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,270
Na Na is weird too.

621
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,190
After she heard about my explanation,

622
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,630
she just agreed to set up a meeting
with Li Xue Mei.

623
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,630
She didn't even ask me any question.

624
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,070
Don't tell me that this is a trap.

625
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,270
All the suspense movies are like this.

626
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,750
Am I the author or are you the author?

627
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,630
Why are you so imaginative?

628
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,470
I'm just being cautious.

629
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,270
Show me the photo that

630
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,550
Na Na sent you again.

631
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,670
Are you sure you really know her?

632
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,910
I think she's my junior.

633
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,630
She looks familiar.

634
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,110
Let's go now.

635
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:09,550
[Zhou Chuan, Song Xi]

636
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,550
Song Xi?

637
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,070
Why are you here?

638
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,710
It's you?

639
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,910
You are Li Xue Mei?

640
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,870
Everyone thinks that they are
more superior than others.

641
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,950
They like to comment on others.

642
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,830
You are that girl in high school?

643
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,180
You remember now?

644
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,560
I know that you won't forget about me.

645
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,150
But,

646
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,750
why is she here?

647
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,510
I...

648
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,910
Why can't my girlfriend

649
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,700
come with me?

650
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,710
You want that test paper, right?

651
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,350
I can give it to you.

652
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,350
But,

653
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,340
I want to talk to you alone.

654
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,270
Forget it.

655
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,580
I don't want the test paper anymore.

656
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,750
Let's go.

657
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,960
[Little Monkey]

658
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,950
[I'll wait for you in the corridor.]

659
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,270
Is that Chu Li?

660
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,670
She's so clingy?

661
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,630
What do you want to tell me?

662
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,100
Do you still remember

663
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,340
the first time we met each other?

664
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,670
This trainer is too smelly.

665
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,510
Take it.

666
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,110
-Stop throwing it around.
-Muscleman Li is going to cry.

667
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,790
Hurry up and comfort her.

668
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,470
I'll tell the teacher if you continue!

669
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,470
You are the one who took her trainer.

670
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,750
Are you that free?

671
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,510
Why are bullying her?

672
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,110
What has it got to do with you?

673
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,470
I think he's Zhou Chuan from year three.

674
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,390
I have to go to class.

675
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,120
I'll let you off the hook today.

676
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,070
The show is over.

677
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,230
Don't mind them.

678
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,790
Just be yourself.

679
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,220
Back then,

680
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,510
you were like a ray of sunshine.

681
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,510
You brightened up

682
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,470

[Zhou Chuan, Song Xi]

684
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,030
From that moment onwards,

685
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,150
I can't help

686
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,630
but to pay all of my attention to you.

687
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,340
I want to know everything about you.

688
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,870
All the best.

689
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,750
You want me to show you

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,630
-the ending just because of a meal?
-Xue Mei, he's here.

691
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,300
Are you serious?

692
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,940
I couldn't sleep last night.

693
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,230
I want to know what happened to
the male lead.

694
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,550
I haven't even written the ending yet.

695
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,950
How would I know?

696
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,710
Excuse me.

697
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,790
You can go in first.

698
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,070
What is it?

699
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,910
Thank you for your help last time.

700
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,670
No need to thank me.

701
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,390
I don't like sweet things.

702
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,950
I'm sorry.

703
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,150
But I can eat one.

704
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,510
Thank you.

705
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,790
You've never accepted anything
from other girls.

706
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,429
But you ate the candy I gave you.

707
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,270
From that moment onwards,

708
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,750
I know that

709
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,860
I'm different to you.

710
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,699
But back then,
I was not good enough for you.

711
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,750
I couldn't openly stay by your side.

712
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,110
So, I could only protect you in secret.

713
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,790
This essay is not that good.

714
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,909
I can write it too.

715
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:43,790
That's right.

716
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,350
I think the teacher must be blind.

717
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,670
Why did he put this instead of my essay?

718
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,830
That's right.

719
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,540
How about...

720
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,870
Stop!

721
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,949
What are you doing?

722
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,790
Do not touch Zhou Chuan's test paper.

723
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,510
She's so scary. What's wrong with her?

724
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,830
Let's go. She's so scary.

725
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,070
Is there something wrong with her?

726
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,130
She must be insane.

727
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,510
I don't care if you believe it or not.

728
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,510
But back then,

729
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,390
I had never thought about hurting you.

730
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,220
But why

731
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,710
are you treating me like other men?

732
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,310
All of us have average score.

733
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,390
Same goes to you, right?

734
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,990
We didn't get into any key school.

735
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,270
But what shocks me the most is

736
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,390
that Muscleman from

737
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,870
year two.

738
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,990
She's so meaty and yet

739
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,630
she came here to find you

740
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,390
and give you candies.

741
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,710
Are fatties nowadays so courageous?

742
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,950
Don't they look at themselves?

743
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,230
Does she think she is good enough for you?

744
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,150
Am I right, Zhou Chuan?

745
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,230
Is that so?

746
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,230
Are you saying that

747
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,310
I should stay away from her?

748
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,990
Yes. You are our school's prince charming.

749
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,590
Don't be with her.

750
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,790
You'll degrade yourself.

751
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,310
That's right.

752
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,590
From that moment onwards, I know that

753
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,950
you care about looks too.

754
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,230
You care about whether or not I'm pretty

755
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,270
and whether or not I'll embarrass you.

756
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,790
But it's okay.

757
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,230
I know that as long as I become pretty,

758
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,030
you'll accept me.

759
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,810
And others will not laugh at you anymore.

760

Since you've become Song Xi,

00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,030
stop living in Li Xue Mei's past.

764
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,230
But you are in my past.

765
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,270
Where's the test paper?

766
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,590
Test paper?

767
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,940
I'll give you the test paper.

768
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,070

What are you doing?

771
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,910
I should not be in your past.

773
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,990
How did it go?

774
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,190
How dare you reject me!

775
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,270
Are you okay?

776
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,140
I'm fine.

777
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,510
I became like this today because of you.

778
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,830
Now, you are telling me
to forget about my past.

779
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,030
How can you do that to me?

780
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,740
What do you want?

781
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,350
I...

782
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,150
I just want to be with you.

783
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,750
Why are you looking at me like this?

784
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,660
You weren't like this in the past.

785
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,070
In high school,

786
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,990
you fetched my shoe for me.

787
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,510
And you ate the candy I gave you.

788
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,950
Look at yourself now.

789
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,710
Do you think you can

790
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,710
do whatever you want

791
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,110
just because you think
you are perfect now?

792
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,990
How are you different from

793
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,190
those people who bullied you back then?

794
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,710
I despise those people who bullied you.

795
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,430
And similarly, I despise
who you've become today.

796
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,180
Why don't you explain it to her just now?

797
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,810
I'll only explain if I care about her.

798
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,030
I don't care about her.

799
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,690
Why should I explain it to her?

800
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,310
Moreover,

801
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,830
if I explain it to her,

802
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,510
it'll look like an excuse.

803
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,800
It'll be pointless.

804
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,670
At first, I thought that after
the hero saves the girl,

805
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,830
it'll be the start of
a beautiful love story.

806
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,630
Song Xi was holding the script
of a female lead.

807
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,350
Don't you know who's
the female lead in my life?

808
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,110
I know.

809
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,750
That's why I pity her.

810
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,470
Her obsession has already
become an illness.

811
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,590
Her self-esteem is too low.

812
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,230
Even if she's a shining actress now,

813
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,760
she's still living in the shadow
of Li Xue Mei.

814
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,590
If I had known it would be like this,

815
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,870
I should've ignored her back then.

816
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,790
You won't do that.

817
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,430
Because you are kind.

818
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,510

819
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,340
Unfortunately, we didn't manage to
get back the test paper.

Jiang Yu Cheng gave me

822
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,180
to the authorities.

823
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,470
I've asked them to issue me
a more detailed text identification.

Although we managed to

835
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,150
make them stay,

836
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,630

838
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,310
some reservations.

839
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,590

their confidence in us,

the editorial department

841
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,980

in this ghostwriting incident.

844
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,510
I second that.

there are things that we can do

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,830
