You should be the one feeling nervous.

157
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,630
If this book failed to sell,

310
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,750

What is the subscription quantity?

432

The total is 45,200 copies.

433
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,080
For the final conservative estimate,
hitting 200 thousand isn't a problem.

434

It's only been the first day.

435
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,350

437

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,950
we can achieve a solid
six digit sales volume.

448

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,550
that will get the readers

559
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,750
excited about going to the site?

560
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,860
I did some research.

561
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,500
Some wanted autographs, manuscripts

562
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,830
and also extra volumes.

563
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,870
Chu Li.

564
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,510
Come take a look.

565
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,510
What do you think
about this publicity banner?

566
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,120
[An oriental fantasy masterpiece
from best selling author Zhou Chuan]

567
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,220
[Book of Luo He God]

568
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,790
It's good.

569
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,750
Good.

570
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,950
Hello?

571
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,630
Chief Editor Yu.

572
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,790
It's me, Zhou Chuan.

573
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,820
Hi, Mr Zhou Chuan.

574
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,670
Can I help you?

575
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,230
I just want to know.

576
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,910
I've been trying to call my editor

577
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,870
about the online pre-sales of my book

578
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,350
but I didn't get any response.

579
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,230
Is she alive?

580
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,110
Mr Zhou Chuan,
your managing editor

581
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,310
is still alive.

582
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,230
[Online pre-sales is going well.
Please don't worry.]

583
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,990
[Chu Li]

584
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,750
[must have been exhausted.]

585
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,820
I'll remind her

586
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,880
to check her phone.

587
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,580
I'm glad the online pre-sales
is going well.

588
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,190
All good now. Bye.

589
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,110
Chu Li.

590
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,710
Chief Editor.
Do you need anything?

591
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,790
You must be tired.

592
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,180
The online pre-sales is going well.

593
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,230
You've worked hard.

594
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,490
Thanks, Chief Editor.

595
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,630
You and Ah Xiang can go home now.

596
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,830
Take a good rest.

597
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,670
Oh, right.
You'd better check your phone.

598
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,820
[The subway is closed.]

599
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:11,520
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour]

600
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,150
[Mr Zhou Chuan is hungry.]

601
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,950
[You probably need
to take a cab home tonight.]

602
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,110
[An additional fee is incurred
if you take a cab at this hour.]

603
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,150
[You're still in the office?]

604
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,150
[Are you still working
on the online pre-sales?]

605
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,790
[Your risk of sudden death is increasing.]

606
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,110
[You have a nice bed at home]

607
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,310
[but you rather sleep in the office?]

608
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,770
[Are you out of your mind?]

609
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,310
Miss.

610
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,390
Do you go to gym?

611
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,830
Miss, I can give you a discount.

612
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,030
You don't look fat

613
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,190
but you can still strengthen your body.

614
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,230
Our trainers are all award winners.

615
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:29,830
No, thanks.

616
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,230
Our equipment are very good.

617
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,950
No, thanks.

618
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,390
Look at our facilities.

619
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:33,820
Look.

620
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,790
Stop pulling me.

621
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,580
Your fee is equivalent to
my monthly meal expenses.

622
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,710
Let me go.

623
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,310
I'm sorry.

624
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,630
Why are you so rude?

625
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,390
Just tell me if you're not interested.

626
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,620
Why did you push me?

627
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,950
You used violence on me.

628
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,610
You have to compensate me.

629
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,590
Compensate?

630
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,830
These papers

631
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,870
probably cost 20 yuan.

632
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,030
Do you want me to print a few hundred more
to build you a shelter?

633
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,060
These are colour prints.

634
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,470
It costs me one and a half
for one piece of paper.

635
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,150
So many pieces here.

636
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,550
You have to pay me 300 yuan.

637
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,510
If not, I'll call the cops.

638
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,790
300 yuan?

639
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,590
Call the cops then.

640
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,850
I can sue you for extortion or something.

641
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,550
You...

642
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,310
Don't run.

643
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,310
You can't go if you don't pay.

644
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,260
Stop pulling me.

645
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,460
Compensate me first.

646
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,870
What's going on?

647
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,950
Get up.

648
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,230
I'm scared

649
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,070
just because you have company.

650
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,670
You still have to compensate me.

651
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,530
Compensate...

652
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,350
He hit him.

653
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,150
He hit him.

654
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,830
Don't act on impulse in future.

655
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,350
Although the other party started it,

656
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,790
using violence in public

657
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,470
is still wrong.

658
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,940
We got it.

659
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,590
Thank you, Mr Policeman.

660
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,220
Get on.

661
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,910
I'll carry you on my back.

662
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,270
What?

663
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,230
Did you hurt your head too?

664
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,590
I said I'll carry you on my back.

665
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,120
Did I not make myself clear?

666
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,950
But...

667
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,950
What is it now?

668
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,990
Can you hurry up?

669
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,270
Don't let me squat here
in front of the police station.

670
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,590
About that...

671
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,949
The online pre-sales is almost ready.

672
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:17,750
We are just waiting for web support now.

673
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,750
The circulation department
is working on it already.

674
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,139
For the exclusive giveaways,

675
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,030
what do you think we should give?

676
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,150
Autograph?

677
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,830
Autograph might not be that attractive.

678
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,830
Not attractive?

679
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,150
How about lucky draw for forwarded post?

680
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,949
This is very important.

681
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,420
Do you have any private item?

682
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,830
Private item?

683
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,469
My editor's head.

684
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,710
Oh, right. Mr Zhou Chuan.

685
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,150
Why were you on the street today?

686
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,230
You weren't even walking the dog.

687
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,750
I was on my way

688
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,210
to the convenience store.

689
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,590
Nothing odd about that.

690
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,110
Why don't we take a cab...

691
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,590
[Chu Li, don't forget our appointment]

692
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:54,520
[Flying Elephant]

00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,120
[with the printing house
tomorrow evening.]

694
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,770
[Flying Elephant]

695
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,430
[I won't go the office tomorrow morning.]

696
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,030
[Mr Zhou Chuan wants to
have a meeting with me]

697
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,630
[about the exclusive giveaways.]

698
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,650
[Chu Li]

699
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,150
Get up.

700
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,030
Disinfect your wound before you sleep.

701
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,090
You'll get an infection if you don't.

702
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,660
If you don't get up now,

703
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,670
I'll pull out your pants.

704
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,230
Don't think that you can get away

705
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,550
with your good looks and writing skills.

706
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,670
I'll call the cops

707
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,310
if you do something to me when I'm asleep.

708
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,790
I just want you to get up

709
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,670
and take off your pants.

710
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,270
What?

711
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,630
You have to disinfect that knee.

712
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,100
You have been out all day.

713
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,430
Are you going to fall asleep
with all that?

714
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,060
Alright, I got it.

715
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,590
I can't take off my pants with you here.

716
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,030
Go downstairs now.

717
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,030
I'll take them off once you're gone.

718
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,390
You can't fool me with that.

719
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,470
It's a trick to get me out

720
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,550
so that you can continue sleeping,
isn't it?

721
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,390
No, no.

722
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,390
You go out first. I'll take them off.

723
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,350
Alright?

724
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,040
I'll come up to check in a while.

725
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,070
You sound like

726
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,150
a teacher

727
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,180
checking on a student's homework.

728
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,470
Go now.

729
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,550
Hello?

730
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,630
Buddy.

731
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,070
What got into you?

732
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,430
I'm not used to this.

733
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,430
What's the matter?

734
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,230
I think I'm undergoing puberty.

735
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,550
What happened?

736
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,910
I suddenly realize
the deep physical meaning

737
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,230
in gender distinction of mankind.

738
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,510
Man

739
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,870
and woman.

740
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,790
I don't understand.

741
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,630
It's tiring to explain to you.

742
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,070
Go downstairs to apply medicine

743
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,670
and come back up to bed.

744
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,070
You can sleep in tomorrow.

745
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,190
I've applied leave for you.

746
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,650
Just go to the printing house
in the evening.

747
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,470
Why are you fixing my schedule?

748
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,460
Flying Elephant texted you.

749
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,310
You looked at my phone?

750
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,630
The message popped up
according to your setting.

751
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,150
I can't unseen it.

752
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,710
Since I've seen it,

753
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,310
I decided to apply leave for you.

754
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,440
What's the problem?

755
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,700
This did sound like me.

756
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,750
I guessed it right.

757
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,510
You

758
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,660
always talk behind my back
with your colleagues.

759
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,270
"Mr Zhou Chuan is running late again."

760
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,670
"Who does he think he is?"

761
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,330
"The centre of the universe?"

762
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,350
You added that last one.

763
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,750
Your leg.

764
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,030
Stop jumping.

765
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,350
The stairs will collapse.

766
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,150
Don't you know you are heavy?

767
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,670
I must thank you for your trouble

768
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,030
to carry me home then.

769
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,470
I'm glad you know.

770
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,510
Get on.

771
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,120
Since I've started a good deed,
let me carry you down.

772
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,990
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

773
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,670
Go slow.

774
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,270
You pulled an all nighter

775
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,800
just for that 350 thousand.

776
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,390
If you don't hit that target,

777
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,780
you have to carry me
around the neighbourhood.

778
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,750
I don't want to.

779
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,830
Be gentle.

780
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,150
Are you making some embroidery?

781
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,270
At this rate,

782
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,670
it will take you forever.

783
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,230
Let me do it.

784
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,670
You know how to treat wounds?

785
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,350
I attended first aid training.

786
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,830
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

787
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,590
You really don't want to slit the wound

788
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,990
to check for residues?

789
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,030
What if the wound heals

790
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,760
with the residue still inside?

791
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,830
Let me do it myself.

792
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,910
Eight Treasure Congee?

793
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,670
Why is it so salty?

794
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,950
Mr Zhou Chuan.

795
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,790
I'm really sorry

796
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,950
I got up late this morning

797
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,510
and did not make you breakfast.

798
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,180
Oh, right.

799
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,670
Give me the phone number
of this take-out restaurant.

800
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,990
I want to file a complaint.

801
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,700
Food has dignity too.

802
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,110
This Eight Treasure Congee
is supposed to be sweet.

803
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,910
This is salty and inedible.

804
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,070
I made this.

805
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,950
You made this?

806
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,830
Actually, it won't be salty

807
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,630
after adding hot water.

808
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,370
Then you should have more.

809
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,950
Eight Treasure Congee can boost your qi
and nourish your blood.

810
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,150
It's perfect for hard workers like you.

811
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,070
You made this congee just for me?

812
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,750
Yes.

813
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,990
I'm afraid if you work yourself to death,

814
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,520
no one can help me
hit the 350 thousand target.

815
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,550
I knew it.

816
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,470
Hello? Chief Editor Yu.

817
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,380
Really?

818
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,790
I'll tell him now.

819
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,870
Good news.

820
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,870
Pre-sales of your book starts next week.

821
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,300
I'll hashtag you
on all official platforms.

822
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,350
You must forward them out.

823
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,910
The more the better.

824
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,030
I'll have to pass this congee.

825
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,090
I need to go to the printing house now.

826
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,670
It's really too salty.

827
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,430
I've booked a cab for you.

828
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,290
I'll pay for it.

829
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,630
Goodbye.
