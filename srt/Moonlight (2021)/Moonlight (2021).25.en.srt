[Episode 25]

4
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,390
I know you're single, but you can't
just act like this.

5
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,830
You're having sinister thoughts

6
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,710
when you see a happy couple like us.

7
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,910
But, your relationship with her is

8
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,470
practically the same as you being single.

9
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,270
Get out.

10
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,789
I've been waiting for you to say that
for a long time.

11
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,229
Let me call Gu Bai Zhi then.

12
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,110
Why are you calling her?

13
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,510
I'm curious about how you two

14
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,950
maintained your relationship
when you're a person like this.

15
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,270
There are three solutions to this.

16
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,300
They're suitable for
all kinds of situations.

17
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,430
Heat up the pan and put your steak in.

18
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,190
First,

19
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,270
you need to cook for her personally.

20
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,430
Because when both of you
are busy with work,

21
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,390
you two won't have opportunities
to eat with each other.

22
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,150
Time will always separate you two.

23
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,950
At this time,

24
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,350
someone needs to stand out

25
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,590
and break the balance.

26
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,460
The meal you prepared for her
will be your opportunity.

27
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,870
You're really lucky.

28
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,150
You have steaks for dinner these few days.

29
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,390
Next,

30
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,510
the way you speak is very important.

31
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,590
But,

32
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,030
flattery doesn't work.

33
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,430
You should ask her directly

34
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,670
and see what you can help her with.

35
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,829
Let her know that

36
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,390
you're there for her

37
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,910
no matter how tired she is.

38
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,900
I know you're worried about Suo Heng.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,590
I know you have no time for me lately.

40
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,710
But, don't worry.

41
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,510
I will take care of myself.

42
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,750
You can tell me everything.

43
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,870
Not only am I your boyfriend, Zhou Chuan,

44
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,190
I'm your best friend, Mr Fox, as well.

45
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,230
Get her a present.

46
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,110
All girls like it when
boys give them presents.

47
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,750
Don't think that buying her accessories
is old-fashioned.

48
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,750
No matter how different she is,

49
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,740
girls will always be girls.

50
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,230
Why hasn't she returned yet?

51
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,670
Why have you only returned by now?

52
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,900
I was too busy.

53
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,150
Have you eaten?

54
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,910
No. I was waiting for you.

55
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,910
I told you that...

56
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,270
I've eaten already.

57
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,940
I need to work overtime later.

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,710
You need to work overtime
even though you're back?

59
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,990
Since when does Yuan Yue Publishing House

60
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,510
know how to extort their employees?

61
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,750
It's not that.

62
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,710
I'm going to the
printing factory tomorrow.

63
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,950
I have to prepare
all of the materials by tonight.

64
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,470
You...

65
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,340
I've prepared dinner.

66
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,950
Let's eat.

67
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,620
I thought you ate already?

68
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,630
Can you still finish the dinner I've made?

69
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,750
I feel hungry suddenly.

70
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,270
It's cold.

71
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,060
Let me heat it up for you.

72
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,710
Men who cook are the coolest.

73
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,350
But of course.

74
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,990
By the way, I've prepared a movie as well.

75
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,510
We can watch it later.

76
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,590
If you don't feel like watching the movie,

77
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,110
we can play some games.

78
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,110
We'll do whatever you want to do.

79
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,590
By the way...

with Suo Heng's front cover.]

83
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,230
Were you caught in the traffic
when you took the bus?

84
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,310
Do you need me to send you to work?

85
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,790
I'll send you there and
pick you up as well.

86
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,860
Not only will you be able to

87
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,030
save money,

88
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,910
you'll be able to rest on my car
on your way there.

89
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,270
What do you think?

90
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,030
Enjoy it while it's hot.

92
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,260
I know you've been busy lately.

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,510
What I want to say is...

94
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,630
Mister,

95
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,750
I had my fill already.

96
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,710
Thank you for your dinner.

97
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,510
Although tonight was very romantic,

98
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,270
I still have work that I need to finish.

99
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,710
I'm not done with
Suo Heng's front cover yet.

100
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,750
I'll leave now.

101
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,310
Delicious!

102
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,830
So delicious!

103

It's so delicious!

106
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,830
I'm going to take a walk with my dog.
Do you want to join me?

107
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,190
No thanks.

108
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,670
You had a large piece of steak.

109
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,310
Don't you want some desserts later?

110
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,950
No thanks.

111
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,070
It hurts! I think I have a bone fracture!

112

jot everything down clearly.

A concubine who has been
banished to the Cold Palace.

If I must say,

182
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,550

these few days.

She didn't catch what
you were trying to do at all.

184
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,270
You should stop imagining things.

185
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,790
You don't understand at all.

186
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,460
A relationship is doomed to fail

187
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,550
once someone neglects the other party
due to their work.

188
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,230
You should know that the best.

189
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,630
Didn't you and Gu Bai Zhi break up

190
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,310
because of the same reason?

191
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,350
Can you just focus on your own problem?

192
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,990
Don't try to drag me into this.

193
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,390
I know what kind of problem
I'm facing right now.

194
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,790
I shouldn't have asked for your opinion
in the first place.

195
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,750
If your solutions did work,

196
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,660
you would've been married with
Gu Bai Zhi long ago.

197
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,510
I shouldn't have asked for your opinion
in the first place.

198
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,870
In the end,
I still need to depend on myself.

199
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,190
Chu Li,

200
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,870
you're acting like

201
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,900
a capable editor now.

202
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,270
Many readers are
curious about you, you know?

203
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,740
I would rather become an editor
who's invisible.

204
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,710
Editors work behind the scenes.

205
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,550
It's great as long as we can help
the writers to publish their books.

206
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,710
There's no need for people
to know of our existence.

207
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,750
It's fine when there's no trouble,

208
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,030
but I'll be reprimanded
if I'm in trouble because of it.

209
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,750
What's wrong?

210
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,550
Your phone was ringing non-stop just now.

211
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,310
Is there anything wrong?

212
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,110
It's Mr Zhou Chuan.

213
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,900
I don't know what's wrong with him lately.

214
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,830
He has been forwarding

215
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,540
some weird articles to me lately.

216
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,070
What articles?

217
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,390
Can I have a look?

218
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,590
I want to read the things

219
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,790
my idol reads usually.

220
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,700
Come.

221
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,150
Why we go cold on our partners?

222
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,660
Why don't women leave men even after

223
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,310
falling out of the relationship?

224
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,350
Women who truly love you

225
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,870
will fulfil two of
the circumstances below.

226
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,830
What? Do you want to tell me something?

227
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,990
Chu Li,

228
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,910
have you been ignoring
Mr Zhou Chuan lately?

229
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,070
Why do you say so?

230
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,830
All these articles are
so blatantly obvious.

231
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,190
He's seeking for attention.

232
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,670
I don't need to work overtime tonight.

233
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,110
I'll make a feast for you tonight.

234
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,790
[I don't need to work overtime tonight.]

235
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,780
[I'll make a feast for you tonight.]

236
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,350
Listen.

237
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,990
Listen to it.

238
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,950
The candlelit dinner was useless.

239
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,510
Do you see

240
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,910
how good and efficient I am?

241
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,990
Please don't give me

242
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,310
any relationship advice in the future.

243
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,670
You're not good enough.

244
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,110
You should consult me

245
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,070
before you court a girl in the future.

246
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,300
I didn't expect myself to be a genius
at something else

247
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,950
besides writing.

248
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,700
Genius? My foot.

249
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,110
I've checked the advance copy
and the gifts.

250
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,070
They're fine.

251
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,590
But you must remember to key in
the online pre-sale edition

252
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,270
as a different entry from
the normal edition.

253
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,460
You hear me?

254
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,990
[Yes, madam.]

255
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,350
[Coming.]

256
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,950
[Sister Chu Li, I'll hang up now.]

257
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,670
[Don't worry.]

258
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,670
[I'll handle this for you.]

259
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,710
Mr Jiang,

260
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,670
I'm really sorry.

261
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,110
I can't attend your function.

262
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,430
Because I'm not done with

263
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,340
Ms Suo Heng's books yet.

264
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,870
You don't need to apologize to him.

265
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,670
You're my girlfriend.

266
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,630
Why are you trying to join him?

267
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,830
I need to correct something.

268
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,950
I didn't invite your girlfriend.

269
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,900
I invited my editor.

270
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,100
Mr Jiang, how about this?

271
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,390
Let Zhou Chuan join you for the function

272
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,390
since it didn't state that you need
a female partner to enter.

273
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,350
-Are you out of your mind?
-No thanks.

274
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,070
Mr Zhou Chuan, stop pretending.

275
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,950
When Mr Jiang gave me

276
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,310
the signed copy of
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

277
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,820
not only did you take it for yourself,

278
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,950
you didn't even let me

279
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,510
take a look at
the heart sticker on the book.

280
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,830
What's with that?

281
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,830
You're my girlfriend, you know?
Why are you curious about

282
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,350
the heart sticker left by him?

283
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,870
Are you done? Leave when you're done.

284
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,990
I can't stand you anymore.

285
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,900
You're not allowed to let him stay.

286
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,910
-I didn't plan...
-Don't worry.

287
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,710
I don't plan to stay for dinner as well.

288
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,470
Chu Li, see you next time.

289
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,910
See her? You're not allowed to see her!

290
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,180
You're finally skipping work

291
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,750
for me today?

292
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,950
So, do you want me to come home?

293
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,750
Will you believe me if I say no?

294
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,150
No.

295
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,990
Give me your hands.

296
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,349
I've been invisible to you

297
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,230
for the past few days.

298
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,270
Why did you buy a present for me then?

299
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,790
If I don't do anything,

300
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,390
we'll go through a breakup soon.

301
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,780
No way. We're in the middle of
our love bubble.

302
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,350
How are we in a love bubble

303
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,070
when we're barely talking to each other?

304
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,710
You don't let me kiss you at all.

305
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,830
It's not that I'm objecting to that.

306
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,430
It's just that
there isn't any opportunity.

307
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,390
Come on then.

308
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,030
I'm ready.

309
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,300
This is more like it.

310
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,950
Seems like the chapters

311
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,870
I've sent to you weren't in vain.

312
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,950
What? Chapters of your new novel?

313
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,950
I just sent them to your email.

314
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,230
I'm going to take a look at them!

315
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,950
I shouldn't have said that.

316
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,190
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,150
Mr Nian Nian,

318
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,110
I've already started to
inspect your scripts.

319
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,030
By the way,

320
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,030
didn't you say that

321
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,950
my shampoo smelled nice?

322
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,990
I bought extra this time.

323
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,310
I'll send them to you later.

324
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,430
You're welcome.

325
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,790
Alright, see you.

326
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,790
Mr He Ma?

327
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,350
How is it? Have you returned to
the country?

328
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,870
I was planning to prepare
a welcoming dinner for you.

329
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,990
The weekend? I'm fine with that.

330
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,990
By the way,

331
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,190
regarding the writer of Luo Yi Monk,

332
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,470
Mr Yu Bo,

333
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,070
have you contacted him for me?

334
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,150
What?

335
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,350
You want me to bring Chu Li with me?

336
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,750
Mr He Ma,

337
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,910
Chu Li is very famous now.

338
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,580
You may not be able to meet her.

339
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,150
Even I couldn't meet her often.

340
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,910
How about this? I'll contact you
if I'm able to

341
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,830
arrange for an appointment with her.

342
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,550
Okay?

343
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,180
That's all for now.

344
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,550
Alright.

345
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,510
Ms Suo Heng, this is great.

346
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,270
The number of copies for
your first print run are increasing.

347
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,270
Thank you, Chu Li.

348
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,350
It's all thanks to you.

349
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,630
Thank you so much.

350
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,940
Not at all.
You should credit yourself as well.

351
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,190
I didn't expect us

352
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,230
to receive 65,000 orders

353
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,150
from the pre-sale online and
the hard copies.

354
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,420
That means you'll be able to sell
70,000 books for your first print run.

355
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,950
I've contacted the printing factory
for the printing of your books.

356
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,270
Chu Li, it's all thanks to you.

357
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,910
Let me treat you to dinner tonight.

358
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,270
I appreciate your effort.

359
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,780
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

360
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,310
I still need to work overtime

361
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,830
to complete your book.

362
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,350
We can go and celebrate our success

363
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,350
after your book is listed on the market.

364
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,350
We must tell Chief Editor Yu
to join us as well.

365
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,270
You may not know,

366
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,190
but she went to check out the sequence

367
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,510
for your books this morning.

368
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,670
She hasn't even returned yet.

369
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,750
Is that so?

370
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,260
Thank her for me.

371
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,630
You want me to thank her for you?

372
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,780
You should thank her yourself.

373
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,150
I'm sure she'll be delighted.

374
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,550
I'm back.

375
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,030
Overtime shifts again?

376
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,150
Why is the living room always messy?

377
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,100
Can't you guys just clean it up?

378
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,470
Mum!

379
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,870
My baby.

380
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,950
Our house wouldn't be in this mess

381
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,990
if you didn't work overtime every day.

382
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,780
Baby,

383
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,190
after I'm finished with my work,

384
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,030
let's go and celebrate

385
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,300
your birthday in Disneyland,

386
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
okay?

387
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,230
That's great.

388
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,310
Mum, there's one more week
before my birthday.

389
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,230
Can I have the chocolate

390
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,460
Grandma left for me?

391
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,550
Baby, I told you before.

392
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,270
What will happen to you
if you consume too much sweets?

393
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,110
I will have a toothache, and worms
will attack my tooth.

394
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,230
Yes, my baby. You're right.

395
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,510
Just let him have one.

396
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,270
My mother bought it especially
for him, you know?

397
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,310
As adults, we mustn't spoil our children.

398
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,230
Just tell Mum

399
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,230
to stop buying sweet things for him.

400
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,070
My mother was the one who's been
taking care of him lately.

401
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,750
What's wrong with having a few sweets?

402
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,910
Qiu Qiu, let's go.

403
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,550
Let's take a bath.

404
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,630
After that, we'll go to sleep.

405
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,580
[Suo Heng]

406
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,790
[Thank you.]

407
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,710
Congratulations.

408
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,790
Why are you here alone?

409
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,990
Chu Li couldn't come as she has
an emergency to attend to.

410
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,470
Bai Zhi,

411
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,510
this is?

412
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,270
You must be Mr Jiang.

413
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,910
I've heard many things about you.
I'm Luo Wen.

414
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,430
I'm from Xin Dun Books.

415
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,430
Hello, Mr Luo.

416
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,470
People often told me that
Mr Jiang is young and talented.

417
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,830
Your reputation is well-deserved.

418
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,750
Mr Jiang, I'm an avid reader of yours.

419
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,460
I've been reading all of your books.

420
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,900
I hope that

421
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,790
we can work together in the future.

422
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,470
You flatter me.

423
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,550
Where's Yun Fei?

424
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,340
-Yun Fei...
-Yun Fei

425
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,670
is busy for the past few days.

426
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,390
That's why I'm here on his behalf.

427
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,710
I won't interrupt you guys then.

428
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,110
Please accompany Mr Jiang.

429
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,070
No problem.

430
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,500
Next time, you can find me.

431
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,550
What?

432
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,460
You can find me

433
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,910
if you lack a male partner.

434
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,990
Let's have a drink.

435
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,270
Mr Lu,

436
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,710
do you remember me?

437
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,390
I'm Luo Wen from Xin Dun Books.

438
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,230
I do remember you.

439
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:49,990
Please.

440
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,630
Alright.

441
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,580
Mr Lu.

442
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,270
Look at your Mr Luo.

443
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,630
He's following Mr Lu like a puppy.

444
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,270
Flattery doesn't work on

445
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,190
Mr Lu at all.

446
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,510
And I still remember that

447
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,230
last time...

448
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,100
Isn't this Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

449
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,710
We meet again.

450
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,630
Your novel,

451
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,110
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

452
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,270
it sold like hotcakes.

453
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,190
I read the book.

454
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,590
I was so regretful.

455
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,110
How could I part ways with
an impeccable novel

456
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,270
like that?

457
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,620
Is that so?

458
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,350
What do you think about
Li Su's ending then?

459
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,340
Li Su?

460
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,550
He left a deep impression on me.

461
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,150
I think his ending is great.

462
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,060
Since Mr Jiang is one of

463
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,590
the best writers out there.

464
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,580
Li Su doesn't exist in the novel.

465
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,190
Yeah.

466
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,550
I think I'm getting too old.

467
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,830
My memories aren't as good
as they used to be.

468
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,790
Excuse me, but you are?

469
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,110
She's Gu Bai Zhi from Xin Dun Books.

470
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,070
Ms Gu from Xin Dun Books?

471
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,590
It's a pleasure to meet you.

472
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,670
It's an honour to see you here.

473
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,830
This...

474
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,430
This is my name card.

475
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,100
Ms Gu.

476
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,070
Mr Jiang.

477
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,630
So,

478
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,390
I won't interrupt you guys then.

479
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,510
Please continue.

480
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,790
Ms Wen Xiang,

481
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,300
this is my name card.

482
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,030
Let's go.

483
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,990
What are you doing?

484
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,350
I have many ideas that
I want to propose to you.

485
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,590
Hey!

486
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,990
I'm sorry about that.

487
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,310
It's fine.

488
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,070
Ms Gu, I know you didn't do it on purpose.

489
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,590
It's just an accident.

490
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,550
Give me a tissue.

491
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,510
Look at him.

492
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,510
He was enraged,

493
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,830
but he still pretended to smile.

494
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,230
If you work with a person like him,

495
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,020
he might stab you in the back one day.

496
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,430
That Wang Yang

497
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,670
has been trying to ruin your reputation

498
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,100
just because he couldn't publish
your book, The Disappearing Zoo.

499
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,670
I wanted to teach him a lesson long ago.

500
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,670
Why do you guys remember my affairs

501
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,550
more clearly than me?

502
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,870
You guys?

503
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,420
Who else is there? Zhou Chuan?

504
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,790
Yeah.

505
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,630
Back then,

506
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,830
Zhou Chuan and I were nobody.

507
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,710
We couldn't do anything about it.

508
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,100
We could only keep it to ourselves.

509
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,300
Besides,

510
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,990
I was your editor back then.

511
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,510
I've finally avenged myself

512
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,310
today.

513
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,900
I've reached home.

514
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,790
I'll go in now.

515
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:15,720
♫ They say strange things
and keep rapport ♫

516
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,270
♫ Guileless adults are reduced to a joke ♫

517
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,550
Wait.

518
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:30,380
♫ Unceasingly, here to stay ♫

519
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,550
Does it still count?

520
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,750
What do you mean?

521
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:37,550
♫ No dancing on the roof, but rain ♫

522
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,270

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,920
♫ The loneliness has found
a place and moved out ♫

524
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,950
you said we could start again.

525
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,060
Does it still count?

526
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,190
What do you think?

527
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:53,630
♫ Guests sillier than me

What is this?

537
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,750
This is a gift that I was supposed to
give to you three years ago.

538
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,070
You're going to be late for work.

539
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,230
Although I haven't finished it,
Mr Zhou Chuan,

540
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,790
your new novel

541
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,230
might be your new masterpiece.

542
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,790
Every book of mine is a masterpiece.

543
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,510
I'll go up then.

544
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,470
I still need to work overtime tonight.

545
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,470
You don't need to wait for me tonight.

546
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,350
You owe me some kisses.

547
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,350
Chu Li!

548
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,430
This is bad! Something happened to
Suo Heng's books!

549
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,950
I read the online reviews

550
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,350
of Little Deity today.

551
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,270
They said they didn't receive any gifts
from the online pre-sale edition.

552
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,790
Only those who bought the hard copy
received the gifts.

553
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,310
Have you asked the
customer service about this?

554
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,110
I did.

555
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,630
But they said they did everything
according to our preference.

556
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,750
I don't know what's going on either.

557
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,150
I'll go to the printing factory.

558
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,470
You should contact Chief Editor Yu.

559
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,790
Alright, I understand.

560
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,830
I'll be there immediately.

561
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,150
Alright.

562
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,510
Something urgent popped up.

563
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,030
Please send him to the kindergarten today.

564
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,590
I have an important meeting
to attend as well.

565
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,870
I mustn't be late.

566
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,870
I need to rush to the company immediately.

567
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,460
Just send him to
the kindergarten this time, okay?

568
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,310
Yu Yao,

569
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,590
you always give the same excuses.

570
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,230
Qiu Qiu,

571
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,030
pat his back.

572
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,630
Qiu Qiu?

573
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,990
Qiu Qiu.

574
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,670
Qiu Qiu, are you okay?

575
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,630
How do you feel?

576
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,940
Do you feel better?

577
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,670
How many times have I told you this?

578
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,430
You should stop Mum from buying
all those sweets for him.

579
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,390
My mother bought him some sweets
because she cared for him.

580
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,390
How could you blame this on my mother?

581
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,150
I'm not blaming Mum.

582
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,670
It's just that sweets aren't good for him.

583
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,110
Why do you always talk to me

584
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,990
with this kind of attitude?

585
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,270
Qiu Qiu, look at me.

586
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,420
It's fine now.

587
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,870
You can go to the kindergarten, right?

588
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,830
Okay.

589
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,070
Alright.

590
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,430
Send him to the kindergarten then.

591
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,070
Ask the teachers to observe him in school.

592
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,990
I'll leave first.

593
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,630
You're leaving just like that?

594
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,310
Suo Heng's books are in huge trouble.

595
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,710
I have to rush over there immediately.

596
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,710
Qiu Qiu is fine now.

597
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,390
I'm really sorry about this.

598
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,710
Yu Yao,

599
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,500
I tried my best to transfer my job
to this state

600
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,150
so that

601
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,110
our family can live together in peace.

602
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,340
But you?

603
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,190
Which is more important in your heart?

604
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,750
Is Yuan Yue Publishing House

605
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,470
more important than our family?

606
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,270
Qiu Qiu, let's go.

607
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,510
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

608
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,870
Chu Li, what's going on?

609
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,630
Why aren't the buyers of
the online pre-sale edition

610
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,830
receiving their gifts?

611
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,590
[Now, the official website of
Yuan Yue Publishing House]

612
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,580
[is filled with their complaints.]

613
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,580
Chief Editor Yu,

614
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,270
I went to the printing factory just now.

615
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,950
The person in charge,
Xiao Wang, made a blunder.

616
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,270
He mixed up the two orders.

617
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,110
[Chief Editor Yu, I'm sorry.]

618
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,590
Enough. Just return here for now.

619
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,980
Stop wasting your time over there.

620
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,110
We need to resolve this

621
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,470
within one hour.

622
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,990
Alright.

623
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,590
Mr Zhou Chuan?

624
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,630
Why are you here?

625
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,750
Look at you, you look so down.

626
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,260
How could I return home in peace?

627
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,550
I've heard everything from Xiang.

628
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,790
Let's return for now.

629
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,830
Tell the circulation department

630
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,190
to stop distributing the current goods.

631
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,790
After that, you can prepare
for the compensation.

632
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,550
Before this happened, I told Xiang that

633
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,350
the readers mustn't know
the existence of the editors.

634
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,470
Because if something happens to the book,

635
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,990
we'll be reprimanded.

636
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,950
And now, I'm in trouble.

637
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,990
I think I'm a jinx.

638
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,150
Yeah, you're a jinx.

639
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,190
Alright, it's fine now.

640
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,630
I'm here for you.

641
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,830
Mr Zhou Chuan,

642
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,030
this concerns my work.

643
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,550
Please don't interfere.

644
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,950
I'm sure Miao and the rest will...

645
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,510
Their opinion doesn't matter.

646
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,910
It's fine as long as
I can help the readers

647
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,470
get their compensation.

648
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,310
I'll wait for you in the car then.

649
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,590
Chu Li,

650
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,310
what's the current situation
in the printing factory?

651
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,310
The person in charge made a blunder.

652
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,340
He mixed up the orders
for the two editions.

653
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,150
That's the reason behind this incident.

654
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,990
I suggest we print new copies
and send it to the readers

655
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,910
in order to calm them down.

656
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,950
Yi Wen is on a sick leave.

657
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,580
You can report it to us.

658
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,710
According to preliminary statistics,

659
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,659
most of the pre-sale goods have been
sent to the readers.

660
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,510
We've recalled all of the books

661
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,230
that haven't been sent out.

662
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,469
Even so,

663
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,350
there are 8,000 copies

664
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,870
on their way to the readers.

665
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,190
You guys heard that?

666
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,630
Of course you can print another copy,
but who'll fork out the postage?

667
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,949
One copy is around 8 to 10 yuan.

668
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,790
For 8,000 copies, it costs around
60,000 yuan.

669
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,230
Who'll pay for it?

670
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,340
Of course the printing factory
will pay for it.

671
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,909
We've told them time and time again.

672
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,150
We told them the gifts are meant
for the online pre-sale edition.

673
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,429
They were the ones who made the blunder.

674
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,630
Of course they need to
be responsible for it.

675
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,949
This is a breach of contract.

676
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,550
We've been working together with the
printing factory for so many years.

677
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,270
Next,

678
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,190
we need to work together with them
for the photo albums

679
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,469
and coloured comic for Role Playing Game.

680
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,350
If we fall out with them

681
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,870
at this crucial moment,

682
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,429
that means we will have to find

683
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,389
another printing factory which can
match our standards.

684
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,230
If we have to let go of
the projects in our hand

685
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,990
because of this incident,

686
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,710
we will incur a big loss.

687
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,750
Wait.

688
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,230
Why do I think

689
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,190
you're trying to speak up for the
printing factory?

690
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,660
You don't want to compensate them?
What about their feelings?

691
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,390
For this kind of matter,

692
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,060
we need to make it sound less serious.

693
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,070
I think our current readers

694
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,900
aren't that hard to deal with,

695
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,270
am I right?

696
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,470
I think they're

697
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,510
giving us such a huge reaction

698
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,030
because they want us

699
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,830
to give them an explanation.

700
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,030
That means

701
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,750
you want someone to be the scapegoat then?

702
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,990
Who will be the scapegoat?

703
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,950
For this,

704
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,990
I think Chu Li will
need to be the scapegoat.

705
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,870
Managing editor,

706
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,390
as the name implies,
she's the one managing it.

707
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,220
If you visit the printing factory

708
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,310
as frequent as you could,

709
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,590
I'm sure they won't have time

710
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,620
to commit such stupid mistakes.

711
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,460
But Chu Li has been frequenting the
printing factory as often as she could.

712
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,350
She would've stayed there
if she could do so.

713
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,750
Now, all the readers

714
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,670
are scolding Ms Suo Heng
on her Weibo account.

715
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,710
They said that they want to boycott them
because she's a liar.

716
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,270
They said she didn't give them

717
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,510
the free gifts she promised to give.

718
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,070
The person who made the blunder
is hiding behind the scene

719
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,540
while my editor needs to take the blame?

720
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,510
I don't agree with that.

721
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,590
I told you already. Chu Li is
the managing editor for the book.

722
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,350
It's logical for her to
admit her mistakes.

723
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,190
How could you say
I'm making her our scapegoat?

724
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,150
I believe Director Yang

725
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,270
would do the same as well,

726
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,830
am I right, Mr Liang?

727
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,030
Fine.

728
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,630
I'll shoulder the responsibility.

729
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,350
Because I don't want my author
to be disheartened.

730
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,670
I don't want her readers
to be disappointed.

731
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,270
This isn't their fault.

732
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,910
But I hope

733
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,390
the circulation department can
make the order by today.

734
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,950
Chu Li

735
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,670
will be suspended for now.

736
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,510
Suspended?

737
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,550
That punishment is too much.

738
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,180
Do you have a better idea?

739
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,510
I'm the chief editor here.
Did I agree to that?

740
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,310
Did Mr Xia agree to that?

741
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,790
She's lucky that she's just suspended.

742
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,110
Now,

743
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,180
we can't afford to fall out
with the printing factory.

744
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,790
Yuan Yue Publishing House

745
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,750
has to pay for all of our loss.

746
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,070
She's just suspended.

747
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,590
We would sack her
if she was someone else.

748
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,590
If Chu Li was the reason behind our loss,

749
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,390
I will be the first

750
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,070
to kick her out.

751
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,990
The problem is she's not responsible
for this mistake.

752
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,830
Why must she shoulder the blame?

753
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,630
It's an order from Director Yang.

754
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,150
Take a look yourself.

755
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,820
As for the period for her suspension,

756
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,030
we'll talk about it next time.

757
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,790
Are you guys done finding your scapegoat?

758
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,670
Mr Zhou Chuan, why are you here?

759
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,190
Deputy Editor Miao,

760
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,750
what's that under your feet?

761
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,270
There's nothing under my feet.

762
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,070
Oh, I understand now.

763
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,790
It's your repulsive character.

764
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,870
Since she's suspended,

765
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,150
I can take her away then.

766
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:38,890
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

767
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,390
You're not allowed to cry.

768
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,310
You're just suspended!

769
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,270
Let's just treat it as a break then.

770
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,270
The key is I don't know
when my suspension will end.

771
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,700
I think I'm going to be sacked soon.

772
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,150
So what if you're sacked?

773
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,150
It's fine, I can support you.

774
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,300
I don't want you to support me.

775
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,190
I want to do my work.

776
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,750
I just want to be a good editor.

777
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,870
Alright, you can be an editor
all you like.

778
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,980
You're the best editor

779
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,350
in the world.

780
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,350
Why is this happening?

781
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,950
This is so unfair!

782
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,430
I left Yuan Yue Publishing House already.

783
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,830
Why should Yuan Yue Publishing House
cover their own loss?

784
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,550
Is it because they want to
maintain a good relationship

785
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,830
with the printing factory?

786
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,670
It's fine.

787
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,580
Let's think of a solution together.

788
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,870
Stop crying, okay?

789
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,590
Stop crying.

790
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,590
I'll be there after two hours.

791
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,910
Mr Liang.

792
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,790
Are you satisfied with the result?

793
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,710
What do you mean?

794
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,110
You've been here for more than 10 years.

795
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,510
I don't believe that

796
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,020
you're satisfied

797
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,190
for letting Yuan Yue Publishing House
cover for our own loss.

798
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,790
All of us know this deep down.

799
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,830
For this matter,

800
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,550
at most, Chu Li can be blamed
for her negligence.

801
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,670
If she's able to shoulder the blame,

802
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,430
no problem, just let her bear the blame.

803
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,310
The problem is, she may appear
to be responsible for it,

804
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,950
but Yuan Yue Publishing House is the one
who's taking all of the blame.

805
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,270
No matter if it's money
or people's opinions,

806
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,870
in the end, Yuan Yue Publishing House

807
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,140
will be the one at a disadvantage.

808
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,870
Yes.

809
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,710
But the solution was already out.

810
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,710
It's useless for you to say that.

811
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,620
Have you ever thought of

812
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,790
whether Miao

813
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,230
is truly trying to help
Yuan Yue Publishing House?

814
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,350
Or is he just trying to chase Chu Li away?

815
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,710
Are you sure that

816
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,750
you want to help the
current Miao Jian Ping?

817
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,070
Chief Editor Yu.

818
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,310
Suo Heng? Why are you here?

819
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,000
I saw the official website's announcement.

820
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,990
Why was Chu Li
suspended from her position?

821
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,910
You haven't been eating well lately.

822
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,990
You should eat up.

823
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,830
Later, we'll think of a solution together.

824
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,830
I deserved it.

825
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,870
This wouldn't have happened

826
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,070
if I went to the printing factory

827
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,830
instead of calling them.

828
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,470
I've let down Ms Suo Heng.

829
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,070
The printing factory is in the wrong here.

830
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,310
You did nothing wrong.

831
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,270
You're the best editor I've ever seen.

832
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,870
How could you know that

833
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,630
when you've barely even seen any editors?

834
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,950
You didn't speak in that tone

835
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,750
when you first became my editor.

836
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,150
[Chu Li,]

837
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,040
[Flying Elephant]

838
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,140
[Ms Suo Heng posted a post for you.]

839
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,350
[Take a look.]

840
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,310
Finish your meal first.

841
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,710
No, return it to me.

842
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,680
[The author, Suo Heng]

843
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,900
[I have]

844
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,340
[always been a weak person]

845
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,590
[who doesn't know how to
stand up for myself.]

846
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,950
[This is my first time doing this.]

847
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,470
[I feel that I need to speak up for her.]

848
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,750
[My editor, Chu Li,]

849
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,900
[she was the only one who didn't
give up on me]

850
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,830
[when I was in despair.]

851
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,390
[She was the one who rushed to protect me]

852
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,230
[from anything.]

853
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,830
[She's a person who will
sacrifice herself]

854
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,590
[in order to protect the writers.]

855
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,950
[Not only is she my editor,]

856
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,990
[she's an important friend
of mine as well.]

857
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,910
[So,]

858
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,420
[please, everyone, stop attacking her.]

859
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,740
[Because you guys don't know]

860
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,030
[how big of a chivalrous fool she is.]

861
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,670
It's fine.

862
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,670
Everything will be over eventually.
