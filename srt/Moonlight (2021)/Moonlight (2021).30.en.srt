Hello?

5
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,000
Come over and do me a favour.

6
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,910
Go tell the producers

7
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,020
not to do night shoots every day.

8
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,770
Who could put up with that?

9
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,110
Sure.

10
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,110
Was Zhou Chuan looking for me today?

11
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,510
No.

12
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,710
He really keeps his cool.

13
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,310
Give me the phone.

14
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,800
Xi Xi, what are you trying to do?

15
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,350
I'll just give him a like.

25
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,950
Thank you so much for your help.

26
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,710
Can you talk properly?

27
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,350
Take that as an eye exercise.

28
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,030
I'm going to

29
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,990

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,870
What are you reading? You seem so serious.

36
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,430
Nothing.

37
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,070
Let me see.

38
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,550

44

Some of them are
the fans of other authors.

45
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,310
And those passersby who know nothing

46
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,030
and join others in the attack.

47
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,430
The scariest ones
are those literature trolls.

48
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,270
They're trolling it because
it's an oriental fantasy novel.

49
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,800
They think it didn't
deserve to be nominated.

50
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,300
They didn't even read it.
Yet, they deem it unworthy.

51

You must tell Mr Zhou Chuan

54
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,350
not to bother himself with these comments.

55
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,430
He probably hasn't seen them.

56
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,310
For the past few days,

58
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,070
with restoring some letter at his place.

59
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,430
He doesn't like to
use the Internet anyway.

60
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,710
He didn't even know who Song Xi is.

61
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,110
Why

62
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,750
are you comforting me instead?

63
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,470
You're his girlfriend.

64
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,830
Shouldn't it worry you the most?

65
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,590
The master isn't around.

66
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,030
Of course the girlfriend must help him

67
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,750

71

72

76
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,190
But it's okay.

77

You should know that, right?

85
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,790
If you could accept his interview,

86
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,310

92
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,630
I need to go now.

93
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,470
Zhou Chuan's new book is
nominated for Huazhi Award.

94
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,070
And it's a great news
for our publishing house.

95
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,710

everyone in the second section.

96

Zhou Chuan managed to
get nominated for Huazhi Award.

99
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,790
As his editor,

100
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,440
you deserve all the credit.

101
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,070
You've worked here
for less than two years.

102
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,710
And you managed to pull it off.

103
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,270

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,310
Look how considerate Director Yang is.

106
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,390
He's just back from the business trip
and hasn't taken a rest.

107
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,670
Yet, he decided to come and visit you.

108
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,870
Thank you, Director Yang.

109
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,870
Thanks to Mr Xia and Chief Editor Yu's

110

111
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,950
Without them,

112
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,590
I wouldn't have done it.

113
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,380
Look.

114
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,550
She knows how to humble herself.

115
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,870
It's a good thing.

116
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,950
She's full of potential.

117
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,990
Indeed.

118
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,750
Truth be told,

119
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,390
when this young lady first joined us,

120
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,510
she's like a little teddy bear dog.

121
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,590
She complaint about everything.

122
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,670
Many of us weren't used to her behaviour.

123
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,150
But I've never gotten mad at her.

124
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,510
On the contrary,
I think she will go places

125
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,830
with her personality.

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,630
Many years have passed.

127
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,140
At last, there's hope for us

128
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,470
to win the Huazhi Award.

129
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,470
How about this?

130
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,590
When Mr Xia's back from the business trip,

131
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,300
I'll recognise your contribution

132
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,760
by giving you some reward.

133
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,510
What you need to do next

134
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,030
is to keep it up.

135
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,340
Go for it!

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,030

Comrade Liu.

140
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,820
It's my first time here in
the motherland of Xinjiang.

141
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,280
And I've all settled down.

142
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,610
Don't miss me too much.

143
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,350
Since the day I arrived in
Xinjiang with the team,

144
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,880
I've more or less
gotten used to the pace here.

145
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,390
Though this land is not
as rich as Jiangnan,

146
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,200
it's majestic and spectacular

147
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,470
for its vastness and epicness.

148
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,470
That's why I don't find it a hardship.

149
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,600
In fact, I can't wait to boast about it.

150
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,790
28th of October, Sunny.

151
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,670
Shu Mei.

152
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,740
Have you been doing well lately?

153
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,520
You complaint in your letter about
me addressing you too formally.

154
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,340
An engineering student like me,

155
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,840
I shall give you all the romance I have.

156
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,990
Does that sound pleasant or not?

157
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,990
I actually beat my brains out
to come up with it.

158
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,550
These are my heartfelt words.

159
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,080
I hope you could forgive me.

160
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,950
In our lives,

161
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,500
we can't stay with
each other until the end.

162
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,150
In another life,

163
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,220
I hope you could leave first.

164
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,550
I'd stay behind and figure out

165
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,610
what it feels like to lose a loved one.

166
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,230
After all, if I were to
leave you here alone,

167
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,070
you'd definitely shed tears

168
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,110
because you're always sentimental.

169
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,110
And I wouldn't feel relieved
being in the underworld.

170
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,590
By then,

171
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,470
I hope you'd make your way
slow to the netherworld.

172
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,600
Give me one more day,
one more minute, or one more second.

173
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,870
I'd absolutely catch up.

174
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,430
I'd cross
the Bridge of Helplessness with you

175
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,090
while holding your hands.

176
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,750
I'm sure the soup of forgetfulness
would even taste good.

177
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,910
Thanks.

178
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,390
You can keep it.

179
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,020
Ms Liu thinks you're
the owner of this watch.

180
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,460
Just keep it.

181
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,580
I hope you could

182
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,440
take me as the owner of this watch.

183
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,110
I'll have it when that day comes.

184
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,710
Do you think we can see the stars tonight?

185
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,510
It's very unlikely

186
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,830
for us to see the stars in the city

187
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,070
during this season.

188
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,800
We might need to go up the mountain.

189
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,030
Qiu Qiu.

190
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,510
You'll do your homework
after playtime? Got it?

191
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,630
Got it, Mum.

192
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,950
Thank you for your help all this time.

193
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
I'm much better.

194
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,270
Sis Yao Yao.

195
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,590
You don't have to act tough before me.

196
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,430
I know.

197
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,590
This is for you.

198
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,910
What's it?

199
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,950
You've been taking care of me and Qiu Qiu

200
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,340
while writing your book.

201
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,510
I noticed your neck
is always uncomfortable.

202
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,990
It's a gift from a friend.

203
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,350
Your neck will no longer
feel uncomfortable.

204
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,390
Relieve it with this.

205
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,670
It's pretty handy.

206
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,550
Thank you.

207
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,580
How are things going
between you and Li Wei?

208
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,150
I'd like to talk to him again

209
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,590
about the custody.

210
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,630
Though it's a divorce,

211
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,790
I don't want to make things ugly.

212
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,550
This is a club member from
my university's literature club.

213
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,070
He's now running a law firm.

214
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,800
You could contact him anytime.

215
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,110
Hello? Mum.

216
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,020
[Yao Yao.]

217
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,830
[Didn't you check the phone?]

218
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,710
[I learnt from Qiu Qiu's teacher]

219
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,790
[that Li Wei is transferring
Qiu Qiu to a new school.]

220
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,070
Transfer?

221
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,310
[Yeah. Weren't you aware of it?]

222
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,670
Got it, Mum.

223
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,460
I'm hanging up.

224
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,590
I'll call you later.

225
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,590
What's wrong?

226
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,820
Hello? Li Wei.

227
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,510
What are you trying to pull here?

228
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,670
Transfer is a serious matter.

229
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,660
Why did you make the decision

230
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,990
without consulting me?

231
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,230
Sis Yao Yao, the kid is here.

232
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,430
You must give me an explanation.

233
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,230
[There's nothing to explain.]

234
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,150
[Since I'm getting Qiu Qiu's custody,]

235
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,790
[his education is naturally
my responsibility.]

236
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,850
[I've chosen the new kindergarten.]

237
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,110
[When I'm back next week,]

238
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,840
[I'll come and pick Qiu Qiu up.]

239
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,800
There's no way I'm giving you
Qiu Qiu's custody.

240
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,870
[Yu Yao.]

241
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,030
[Do you think you can win?]

242
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,750
[Don't you forget this.]

243
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,870
[You're staying in my house.]

244
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,190
[Do you think the court
will give the custody]

245
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,750
[to a homeless single mum?]

246
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,590
[You want the custody?]

247
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,350
[Dream on!]

248
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:33,960
[Xu Chao]

249
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,440
Is everything alright?

250
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,080
[Xu Chao]

251
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,660
[Who's Zhou Chuan?
Let me look it up on Baidu. He's so young]

252
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,070
[What nonsense is this?]

253
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,420
[What genre is Book of Luo He God?
I've never heard of it.]

254
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,970
[Why isn't Mr He Ma's The Earth nominated?]

255
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,730
[An oriental fantasy book got nominated?
The bar is getting lower indeed.]

256
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,310
Gosh, I'm worn out!

257
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,040
Thank goodness, tomorrow is weekend.

258
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,030
Have some water.

259
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,430
Thanks.

260
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,870
Why do I find you
particularly attentive today?

261
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,070
Let's go meet Song Xi together
tomorrow afternoon.

262
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,710
Meeting Song Xi?

263
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,070
You want to meet her, don't you?

264
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,950
You didn't manage to do so last time.

265
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,510
Sure!

266
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,270
Who is this?

267
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,350
Her name is Chu Li. She's my...

268
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,310
Editor. I'm his editor.

269
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,660
Book of Luo He God is edited by me.

270
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,470
Both of you seem to be very close.

271
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,000
It's alright. We've had
some collaboration after all.

272
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,470
Indeed.

273
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,790
I learnt that Mr Zhou has a girlfriend.

274
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,590
He seems to have one.

275
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,390
My girlfriend and I
know each other very well.

276
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,270
That's right. They're very close.

277
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,910
As if they're one.

278
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,350
Your name is Chu Li, right?

279
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,950
I should be slightly older than you.

280
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,310
Can I call you Xiao Chu?

281
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,390
Sure, Ms Song.

282
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,990
Just call me Xi Xi.

283
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,140
Actually, I really envy you

284
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,590
that you could help Mr Zhou Chuan
with his book publication.

285
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,660
Truthfully,

286
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,110
I've always been his fan.

287
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,790
And I've been waiting for the day

288
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,630
when I could interpret his work.

289
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,310
Are you really his reader?

290
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,510
I've paid attention to Mr Zhou long ago.

291
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,830
It's longer than you think.

292
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,550
Xiao Chu, can I add your WeChat ID?

293
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,790
Mine?

294
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,180
I'll directly contact you

295
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,470
when it comes to work.

296
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,349
Sure.

297
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,150
-Sure.
-Let me scan your QR code.

298
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,710
I've just had a scandal
with Mr Zhou after all.

299
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,510
It's not convenient for me
to meet him often.

300
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,710
Oh, right. Speaking of which,

301
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,470
does your girlfriend

302
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,230
take that scandal to heart?

303
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,070
No. Not at all.

304
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,510
His girlfriend is aware that

305
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,470
it's all the paparazzi's doing.

306
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,390
Great.

307
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,670
But I'd like to apologise

308
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,530
for causing you trouble, Mr Zhou.

309
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,190
Xiao Chu.

310
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,390
Why didn't you admit that
you're my girlfriend?

311
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,310
You even have had fun talking to her.

312
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,630
Who would bring his girlfriend to work?

313
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,270
How unprofessional.

314
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,350
Then why did you add her WeChat ID?

315
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,060
You think I could reject her?

316
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,990
Also, she's quite nice.

317
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,510
What are you laughing about?

318
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,350
I can't let you contact her directly.

319
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,060
Do you want to get close to her?

320
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,150
Why would I do that?

321
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,110
Are you getting jealous?

322
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,390
Why would I get jealous?

323
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,390
You're obviously getting jealous.

324
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,270
Go find out what they're talking about.

325
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,790
Sure.

326
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,030
I'm sure you're getting jealous.

327
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,030
Who's getting jealous?

328
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,430
You are getting jealous.

329
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,390
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

330
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,910
Could you tell us what's
your relationship with Song Xi?

331
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,590
Why did you talk about
the collaboration in the hotel?

332
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,430
Please tell us what's your relationship.

333
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,500
When do you plan to make it public?

334
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,510
Mr Zhou, is it really a collaboration?

335
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,570
-Mr Zhou, please answer us.
-Mr Zhou.

336
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,070
Mr Zhou.

337
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,550
Mr Zhou, please answer us.

338
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,840
You bumped into my girlfriend.

339
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,220
If you ever leak the photos out,

340
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,110
you'll receive a letter from my lawyer.

341
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,150
♫ As if enemies, yet full of chemistry ♫

342
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,910
Let's go.

343
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,100
♫ We could've become sworn brothers ♫

344
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,320
♫ If it weren't for the moonlight ♫

345
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,140
♫ I realized that I was going astray ♫

346
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,620
♫ I've got a million whys ♫

347
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,380
♫ From a genius to a fool ♫

348
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,740
♫ I still have my talents ♫

349
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,620
♫ I fled for a week ♫

350
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,830
Are you hurt?

351
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,220
♫ You don't seem to be surprised ♫

352
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,590
It seems that the collaboration
isn't going to work.

353
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,720
♫ Cause when you hold me in your arms ♫

354
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,690
I'll reject her later.

355
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,750
Why?

356
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,970
♫ I've never felt so right ♫

357
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,990
I won't allow anyone

358
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,650
to take you away from me again.

359
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,000
♫ If this is not love ♫

360
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,070
Where did you pick up
that outdated pickup line?

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,900
♫ What can I tell myself? ♫

362
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,420
I didn't pick it up.

363
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,390
It's really what I wanted to say.

364
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,590
Forget it if you don't like it.

365
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,510
No, I like it.

366
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,030
You acted like

367
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,830
a knight who saves a princess in trouble.

368
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,700
Well...

369
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,390
Your collaboration with Song Xi...

370
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,550
I no longer want to collaborate with her.

371
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,830
I might as well

372
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,790
spend my time on Maurer's script,

373
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,430
right?

374
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,070
Alright.

375
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,460
Whatever you want.

376
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,860
I respect your decision.

377
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,660
Gu Bai Zhi and Jiang Yu Chen are going on

378
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,470
a camping trip in the mountain tomorrow.

379
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,420
Let's join them.

380
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,830
Join them?

381
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,230
You're sure Mr Jiang would want us

382
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,550
to join them and be third wheels?

383
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,190
Doesn't he want to spend time

384
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,390
alone with Director Gu?

385
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,060
Only if she wants to.

386
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,070
We wouldn't be third wheels.

387
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,910
We're definitely the super glue

388
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,950
that binds them together.

389
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,220
[A trip to the mountain
would take him out of himself.]

390
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,550
[so that he wouldn't find out about
those comments online.]

391
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,270
Sure, I haven't had a camping anyway.

392
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,150
Should we head to the supermarket

393
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,910
and buy some stuff for it?

394
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,270
Skewers, tents,

395
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,470
drinks, snacks, and others.

396
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,390
Sure.

397
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,870
We're heading there now.

398
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,470
I was right.

399
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,790
That girl is his girlfriend.

400
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,990
Tell me,

401
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,670
how do you find that girl?

402
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,200
Of course she's not
as pretty as you, Sis Xi Xi.

403
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,310
[Hello, Ms Song.]

404
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:32,400
[Chu Li]

405
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,070
[We've thought it through.]

406
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,630
[For now, Mr Zhou Chuan
doesn't plan to sell the rights.]

407
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,870
[I'm sorry.]

408
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,400
[We look forward to
collaborating with you.]

409
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,430
He rejected me.

410
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,310
Well, it's okay.

411
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,870
I'll buy you a meal tomorrow.

412
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,750
Why are you cleaning that up?

413
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,390
There's no one here to see you sadfishing!

414
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,450
Is there no cleaner?
Ask one to come here and clean it up!

415
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,940
Get me the wine.

416
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,550
I've been waiting for
Zhou Chuan for years.

417
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,040
Who does she think she is
getting involved in our relationship?

418
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,910
Who does she think she is?

419
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,980
[I'm going on a camping trip tomorrow.]

420
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,930
[Chu Li]

421
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,590
[Shall we make it next week?]

422
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,510
Well,

423
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,070
are we going on a camping trip or moving?

424
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,340
It's my first camping trip.

425
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,540
Of course I need to be
fully prepared for it.

426
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,990
Alright, let's go now.

427
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,150
If we don't make it there before noon,

428
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,750
we'll have to climb
the mountain under the sun.

429
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,830
You're right.

430
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,950
To those who are physically weak,

431
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,220
it's a bad idea indeed.

432
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,590
What do you mean?

433
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,470
You want to have a match?

434
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,510
I don't bully the weak.

435
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,390
I guess you're afraid of
taking up the challenge.

436
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,070
Right, Director Gu?

437
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,630
Can you hurry up?

438
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,590
Right away.

439
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,430
Are you up for a wager?

440
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,630
Whoever reaches the mountain top last
will prepare barbecue for tonight.

441
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,390
Sure.

442
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,230
It seems that we'll be
the honour guests today.

443
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,630
No need.

444
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,510
Don't worry.

445
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,310
If you lose,

446
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,070
I'll

447
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,910
do the resting part.

448
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,470
Silly.

449
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,840
Did you hear her? She called you silly.

450
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,720
You'll take the front seat.

451
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,310
You're smart.

452
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,430
I'll let you win the mountain climbing.

453
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,950
I don't need you to do that.

454
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,270
No way, I'll add one more rule.

455
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,190
If you lose it,

456
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,630
you'll climb up to
the mountain and shout that

457
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,290
"Zhou Chuan is the most good-looking
and mature man in the world."

458
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,230
-Sure.
-What?

459
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,950
If you lose it,

460
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,110
you will shout that
"Jiang Yu Chen is your idol".

461
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,190
Bring it on.

462
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,450
Are you going to bicker all along the way?

463
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,390
Let's go!

464
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,980
I can't go any further.

465
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,990
Let's take a break.

466
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,100
Come on.

467
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,810
Take a break. You don't have to follow me.

468
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,750
I'm fine.

469
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,060
It's just a warm up.

470
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,470
Thank you for coming with me.

471
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,680
I'm here to take
starry sky photos for Ms Liu.

472
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,470
Don't worry.

473
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,750
The clouds are thin today.

474
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,230
I'm sure there'll be a starry sky tonight.

475
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,070
You can then take photos

476
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,330
and send them to Ms Liu.

477
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,430
You weren't this tired

478
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,990
from climbing Mount Hua.

479
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,630
Are you doubting my physical strength?

480
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,910
Sir.

481
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,440
I really can't do this anymore.

482
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,320
Why don't you go ahead first?
Let me take a break.

483
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,300
Come.

484
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,680
How can you run carrying
two backpacks on your back?

485
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,390
Why can't I?

486
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,850
Are you looking down on me?

487
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,300
Since you're pretty tired,

488
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,220
shall we

489
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,470
take a break?

490
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,110
Aren't you having a match with Mr Jiang?

491
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,110
Take a break and you'll lose.

492
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,700
Whatever.

493
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,030
There's no way I'm leaving you here alone.

494
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,870
Well...

495
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,940
Why don't you change your handle?

496
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,990
Stop calling yourself Monkey.

497
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,950
Let's name you

498
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,310
Fat Tortoise.

499
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,150
You're recharged. Let's get on with it.

500
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,060
Let's go.

501
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,670
Jiang Yu Chen is my idol.

502
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,710
Have you forgotten?

503
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,630
I reached the camp site
ten seconds before you did.

504
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,490
I've been waiting for your shout.

505
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,390
Mr Zhou, the great writer.

506
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,590
You won't go back on your word, will you?

507
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,230
I did.

508
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,710
I meant a shout within my heart.

509
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,190
I just shouted it in my heart.

510
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,550
I bet you heard it.

511
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,270
You've become not only older,

512
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,310
but also more thick-skinned.

513
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,390
So have you.

514
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,070
Well, how's the script for Maurer

515
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,470
coming along?

516
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,710
At first,

517
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,180
I thought you wouldn't join the trip.

518
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,710
Instead, you'd focus on the writing.

519
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,270
Down the mountain, there are
many haters who are jealous of me.

520
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,110
The mountain is
a place of leisure and joy.

521
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,390
What's wrong?

522
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,430
Every morning I open up Weibo,

523
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,160
I receive loads of
private messages from haters.

524
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,060
Pay them no mind.

525
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,070
These comments are unfounded after all.

526
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,310
They'll stop eventually.

527
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,270
I don't take them seriously.

528
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,100
I'm afraid Chu Li would find out about it.

529
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,470
If she did, she'd get furious.

530
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,350
That's why I took her here for leisure.

531
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,510
So that she could stay away from all this.

532
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,270
She seems very happy.

533
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,200
She probably hasn't found out, no?

534
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,790
Do you need my help tonight?

535
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,470
What help?

536
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,200
Don't you mess things up again.

537
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,550
Mess up what?

538
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,790
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

539
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,700
It's ready for grilling, isn't it?

540
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,150
Yeah, it's ready.

541
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,590
Great! I'll go get the meat.

542
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,630
Meat?

543
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,910
Where's the meat?

544
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,340
Meat?

545
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,150
I asked you

546
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,390
to get it from the fridge, didn't I?

547
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,350
I only got us the greens. I...

548
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,230
You... What do we do without the meat?

549
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,510
Jiang Yu Chen.

550
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,710
Don't look at me.

551
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,830
I did as you said

552
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,150
and got us the drinks.

553
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,810
-Director Gu.
-I was in charged of the wines.

554
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,790
Zhou Chuan. You...

555
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,940
Well,

556
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,690
isn't there a lake?

557
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,030
You're young.

558
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,690
But you forget things easily.

559
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,790
Cut it out.

560
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,350
The loser will keep vigil over
the camp site tonight.

561
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,470
Deal.

562
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,120
What are you looking at?

563
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,220
I'm using a Kufashi fishing rod.

564
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,130
Amateurs would be
too ashamed to lay hands on it.

565
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,940
You're so vain.

566
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,030
With bad driving skills,

567
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,290
you wouldn't put
a Bugatti into good use.

568
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,270
It's my choice.

569
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,270
Look.

570
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,150
Do they look like
a kindergarten class monitor

571
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,810
who is out here fishing
with his little brother?

572
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,250
Who's the class monitor here?

573
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,110
It's definitely Mr Jiang.

574
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,220
He seems more professional.

575
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,300
Whether he's professional or not,

576
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,870
we'll find out soon.

577
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,850
Get over here, Big Goose.

578
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,070
I've had eight mosquito bumps.

579
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,590
Why haven't you caught a single fish?

580
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,630
Is your Kufashi fishing rod working?

581
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,270
The fishes will have their meal soon.

582
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,110
I understand if Zhou Chuan can't do it.

583
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,710
Jiang Yu Cheng,
why haven't you caught any?

584
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,870
What do you mean by that?

585
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,630
You don't respect me.

586
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,430
Discipline her.

587
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,590
There's no fish in this lake.

588
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,870
Mr Jiang made this grilled fish.
But is it edible?

589
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,390
It's delicious.

590
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,510
You all have had a long day.

591
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,990
Here, have some juice tea.

592
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,110
Thanks.

593
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,630
Thanks.

594
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,670
I'll help myself.

595
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,270
Well,

596
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,510
that mister was truly a haggler.

597
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,230
One hundred yuan per fish.

598
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,490
Wasn't it outrageous?

599
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,030
Blame it on our uselessness.

600
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,260
You're to blame.

601
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,910
If you hadn't forgotten

602
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,830
the meat,

603
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,990
we wouldn't have to
waste our money on these.

604
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,390
My wallet has paid the price,

605
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,670
hasn't it?

606
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,700
Is it ready?

607
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,190
It should be so in a bit.

608
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,750
Meanwhile, why don't we

609
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,870
play a game?

610
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,710
Sure! What game are we playing?

611
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,350
The King.

612
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,070
Sure.

613
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,230
I like The King the most.

614
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,110
I'll go first.

615
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,949
I'm the king!

616
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:43,190
The two of hearts will carries
the three of hearts while doing squats.

617
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,699
Carry him like a princess.

618
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,909
Who has the two of hearts?

619
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,500
I got the three of hearts.

620
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,830
Then who got the two of hearts?

621
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,110
Me. What's the problem?

622
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,790
Let's do it.

623
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,180
Let me carry you like a princess.

624
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,910
Like a princess.

625
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,350
It's K again. I'm the king again.

626
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,630
This game really favours me!

627
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:25,750
The two of hearts will kiss
the cheek of three of hearts.

628
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,750
And

629
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,030
drink cross-cupped

630
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,430
tea juice.

631
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,890
I have the three of hearts.

632
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,630
Who got the two of hearts?

633
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,390
Not me.

634
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,950
Director Gu.

635
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,620
The fish is getting burnt.

636
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,420
Director Gu.

637
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,510
Are you a sore loser?

638
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,430
Director Gu.

639
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,990
You need to obey the game rules.

640
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,540
Forget it. I'll skip this round.

641
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,110
Let's play another game.

642
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,150
I'm up for Truth or Dare.

643
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,550
Who's there?

644
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,150
It's me.

645
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,790
Why are you here?

646
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,350
You came here alone
to retrieve the wicker basket.

647
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,710
I felt worried.

648
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,240
What's unsafe about it?
It's just a few steps away from the site.

649
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,550
Don't be afraid.

650
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,190
Don't you find it too mean?

651
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,110
What if it's really given her a scare?

652
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,190
Don't worry.

653
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,270
Jiang Yu Chen won't let
anything happen to her.

654
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,830
We should leave now.

655
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,360
They can't know about this.

656
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,990
What's wrong?

657
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,510
My ankle is wet.

658
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,030
This is such a beautiful place.

659
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,060
I feel like staying here forever.

660
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,670
And fish every day?

661
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,670
No.

662
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,550
I'm saying a life here

663
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,820
is a worry-free one.

664
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,950
Are you

665
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,990
full of worries?

666
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,390
Not at all. That's just a thought.

667
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,350
Did you read

668
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,210
the comments about Huazhi Award?

669
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,310
How did you know?

670
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,510
Wait.

671
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,830
Why does the air smell like salty fish?

672
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,380
My sock!

673
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,510
Careful.

674
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,590
You shouldn't have talked to me.

675
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,670
You're supposed to
keep an eye on the fire.

676
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,790
I...

677
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,390
I didn't know this sock could

678
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,150
cook and burn on its own.

679
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,830
It seems that the sound is gone.

680
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,660
Thank you.

681
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,630
It's nothing.

682
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,470
I'm talking about

683
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,310
what you've done for Ms Liu lately.

684
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,470
I remember we made a promise.

685
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,890
That we don't say thank you to each other.

686
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,080
Isn't this Zhou Chuan's phone?

687
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,220
Why is it here?

688
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,710
I told you so! There's no wolf here!

689
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,350
Well, I knew nothing about it.

690
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,230
Why don't you burn a hole on your sock?

691
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,830
Let's wear couple socks.

692
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,870
You wish.

693
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,910
Why didn't you tell me about

694
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,590
the incident of Huazhi Award?

695
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,990
Listen.

696
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,870
Those netizens

697
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,590
joined the attack

698
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,630
because they didn't read your book.

699
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,110
I don't want you to concern about it.

700
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,590
But I'm still very worried about you.

701
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,630
What's there to worry about?

702
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,270
These comments can't hurt me at all.

703
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,190
Moreover, I have you.

704
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,650
Aren't you going to ask me why?

705
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,030
Why?

706
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,270
Because you have a thick tortoise shell.

707
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,070
You can protect me from all this.

708
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,070
What tortoise shell?
You're not good with words.

709
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,900
Zhou Chuan!

710
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,910
Why did you shout at me?

711
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,590
You're the only one here.

712
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,950
Why is my phone with you? Thanks.

713
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,950
Why are you thanking me?

714
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,230
I found it on my way back.

715
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,790
-Why did you scare her?
-I...

716
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,060
I have nothing to do with it.

717
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,430
I tried to stop him.

718
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,190
Well, who taught you

719
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,340
how to betray others?

720
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,180
Who did I do that for?

721
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,430
Think about it.

722
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,710
You almost got me into trouble.

723
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,790
She thinks I'm part of your plan.

724
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,190
What are you whispering about?

725
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,650
Trying to figure out
a way to clear your name?

726
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,150
He said he's wrong.

727
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,670
I...

728
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,710
Hello?

729
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,830
Okay, got it.

730
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,830
Where are you going? Who was that?

731
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,390
Hospital.

732
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,060
They said Ms Liu

733
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,380
is not going to make it.
