00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I heard a song about a bride

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
when I was young.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A little butterfly

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
flies over the Guanyin Bridge

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and turns back again.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The fairy walks into the sea of no hope.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you that running bride?

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Lady Jiang.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Lady Jiang.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why is there so much blood

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
on the back of my head?

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A'Mo.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A'Mo.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When will there be a beach?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There has always been a beach in your yard.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Every year, the world is blooming.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,040
Then the fairy

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
is so beautiful

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that you are so obsessed with killing enemies.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You are not good at anything.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Even your own home

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
is not a good place to be.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
why did you pay attention tonight?

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I...

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Silly.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because there is another person in the family.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What do you mean?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
By the way, General,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
how do we deal with that woman?

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Deal with?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You taught me

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that a traitor

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
should not be soft-hearted.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You want to use the knife to stab the pearl.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why don't we...

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have taught you

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to control the knife in your hand.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You should make a clear decision.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Shen Que.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are awake.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
took care of me all night.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No. I just came.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I...

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I just came.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I...

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I just came.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I...

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I just came.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Then we should

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
settle our score.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Where should we settle?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
From the moment I killed you.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I stabbed you.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Should I be bloodthirsty?

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I just want an answer.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Did you really want me to die?

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The rebels were in chaos

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and the capital was in danger.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Your brother was caught by the rebels.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Que Que.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Where is Que Que?

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Watch out!

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Run!

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mom!

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Zhao Shou!

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Shen Que!

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Xiaosong!

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let her go!

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let her go!

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let her go!

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Little lady.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is this your little lover?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Do you want your little lover to be killed

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and we can live happily together?

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Or do you want her to see us

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
live happily together

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and send you to die together?

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you touch her,

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll kill you!

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You are quite tough.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Live on.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Live on.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What did you say?

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't hear you.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I said,

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
what kind of prince is he?

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He is just a slave.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I have admired heroes since I was a child.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I hope you can let me live.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you don't believe me,

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
how about

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I kill him myself

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and surrender to you?

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Great!

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll help you.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Come on.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Give him a knife.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Xiaosong.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why?

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Nothing is more important

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
than me living.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When I woke up,

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I was in my adoptive father's camp.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I ask you,

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
did you really want me to die?

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What else?

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The rebels wanted to kill me.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I must die.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But if you do it,

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and avoid the poison,

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I may be alive, right?

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You think too much.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I just want to live on my own.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
When I was a slave,

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I had nothing to pity.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But when you said

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you found me,

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I admit

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
your skill of hiding people

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
has improved.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can always find you.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You took me back to the mortal world.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
After many years,

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I was full of hatred.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I walked like a corpse

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
until last night.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I saw a lot of flowers.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was shocked.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I came back to the mortal world.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I found you.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
At that moment, I asked myself,

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
why I can't believe the person

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
who took me back to the mortal world

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
once again?

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Tell me the answer.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mrs. Jiang,

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
your mother is here to see you home.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let me ask you.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How did you become like this?

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are so arrogant.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You don't even return home to kill people.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What else do you dare not do?

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Where is my good daughter?

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Isn't your good daughter

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
in your home?

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You blame me for keeping her?

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If I hadn't been so grudging,

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
how would the Jiang family have turned over?

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Seeing that the Yao clan was hit by the sword,

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you want to marry into the Prime Minister's Mansion.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But you ruined everything.

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You ruined everything.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You still come to stop me.

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mrs. Jiang, please be careful.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mrs. Jiang,

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
how can you hit your wife?

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you know how badly she was hurt?

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Forget it.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Forget it.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't control you.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The wedding will be held in five days.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You don't have to show up.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You want her to marry for me?

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You are now in the south,

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
not clear, not clear.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And you abandoned the Jiang family.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This marriage

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
has nothing to do with you.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You are just a daydream.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The one who marries Cui Youan in five days

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
can only be me.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The one who has the third uncle and sixth uncle is me.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why should I let others take it?

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The more he wants,

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the more I won't give it to him.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I must marry Cui Youan.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I must.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where is the grandson?

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Can you tell me now?

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No need.

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Cui Youan.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This lady,

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
my bride is not you.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Father,

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
even if I can't find the grandson,

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't want to sacrifice anyone

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to make my marriage a success.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Cui Youan,

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I won't marry.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I will tell you the whereabouts of the grandson now.

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Just take it as my wedding gift for you.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have thought it through.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The sweet and sour melon is not sweet.

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
As long as you are happy,

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I will be content.

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Cui Youan,

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I will tell you the whereabouts of the grandson now.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I will tell you the whereabouts of the grandson now.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I will tell you the whereabouts of the grandson now.

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I will tell you the whereabouts of the grandson now.

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I will tell you the whereabouts of the grandson now.

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
After the grandson left the folk world,

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
he changed his name to Zhao Si.

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He opened a bakery here.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Manager Zhao,

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
a guest is here.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Manager Zhao.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Manager Zhao.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Manager Zhao,

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
a guest is here.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Manager Zhao.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Master,

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll go and have a look.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No one is here.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The things are emptied.

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Cui Youan,

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you have to believe me.

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I saw him selling pancakes here two days ago.

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I didn't lie to you.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Believe me.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I really didn't lie to you.

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The young master of the Prime Minister's Mansion is here.

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll see who dares to do it.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Be careful.

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Manager Zhao.

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Manager Zhao.

238
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Cui Youan,

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
believe me.

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I really didn't lie to you.

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't say it.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll take you to see the doctor.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Believe me.

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I believe you.

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I believe you.

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Cui Youan,

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I want to tell you a secret.

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Listen to me.

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't fall asleep.

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I fell in love with you

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the first time I saw you.

253
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I really like you so much.

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Can you try to like me?

255
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Try to like me,

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
okay?

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't worry, Cui.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The sword is not a key.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Old Jun,

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think he's just playing.

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He doesn't know where the bastard is.

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why don't you peel his skin

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and throw it out to feed the dog?

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Master,

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I took someone to find out.

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What Jiang Jiaojiao said is true.

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But it seems that someone

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
took the royal grandson away two days ago.

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I almost blamed him.

270
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Actually,

271
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I just want to say

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that Master married Jiang Song for the sake of the trust.

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But he's after all scheming against you.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And Jiang Jiaojiao risked her life to save you.

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Master, why

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
don't you pity the people around you?

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Cui.

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Actually,

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I just want to say

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
that Cui last time

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
a mid apprentices of Zhu manor

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
said he had for one month

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,400
the Toy & Post service

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He's her ex-husband.

285
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hardly not for the past nine to fifteen years,

286
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
my wife ...

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Last their lives,

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,700
when Yueoldsiyuan

289
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Why did he move away?

290
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
No.

291
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,300
It says

292
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,500
Cui You An is the grandson

293
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,100
he found the day after.

294
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,700
It's not the time yet.

295
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,500
Why did he move away?

296
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,500
Is Jiang Song not dead?

297
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,500
He's got butterfly effect on the plot.

298
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,300
Now I don't know where he is.

299
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,100
How can I tell you?

300
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Let's bet.

301
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,100
When I bring Cui You An into the bakery,

302
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
you can do it.

303
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,900
How can we cooperate with your trick?

304
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,300
You attack him, I'll block his way.

305
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
But pay attention, be gentle.

306
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,900
Don't be so rude.

307
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Don't worry.

308
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
I've killed the pig.

309
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,700
I've got the soul.

310
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,900
Time to work.

311
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,100
You'd better try.

312
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
As expected.

313
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,100
This is what the hero in the novel is like.

314
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,100
Idiot.

315
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,300
I said I'd use the knife, but it's cut.

316
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,100
It hurts.

317
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Don't be afraid.

318
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,900
It's me.

319
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
Why are you here?

320
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
My wedding is in a few days.

321
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
I'll go home and get married.

322
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
It's not necessarily your wedding.

323
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,100
You must think

324
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,900
your trick

325
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,300
is not good enough.

326
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
You're right.

327
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,700
I'm not a good person.

328
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,300
Your trick

329
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
can touch Cui You An.

330
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,700
What trick?

331
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
I'm really worried about Cui You An's injury.

332
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,700
You pretend to know where his grandson is.

333
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,100
You buy a gang of traitors to play with you.

334
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,100
It's not a trick.

335
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
What is it?

336
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,500
How do you know?

337
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
You don't know?

338
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
I arranged the archery.

339
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,500
You want to kill me again?

340
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Of course.

341
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
You forgot?

342
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
You can't kill me.

343
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Yes.

344
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,100
I can't kill you personally.

345
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,700
But can I use someone else's hand?

346
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,700
I want to try.

347
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,500
It seems to be possible.

348
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,900
But it's a pity.

349
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
By the way,

350
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,300
do you know why

351
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,900
the grandson moved out of the sudden?

352
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
It's you.

353
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
I know it.

354
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
I've understood.

355
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,300
If we don't do something,

356
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,500
my grandson will kill me.

357
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Give it to me.

358
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,500
Aren't youuki's father?

359
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Jiao Yang brings you up.

360
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
She thinks something is wrong with her.

361
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,580
Prime Minister will know I'm here at any time.

362
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,060
Yes.

363
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,260
A lady will tell you where the Prime Minister's mansion is.

364
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,140
Think about it.

365
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,700
Except for the Third Prince,

366
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,940
only you can be the Crown Prince.

367
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,020
They won't let you off.

368
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,420
So you've been

369
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
fighting with me with this book.

370
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,460
The future?

371
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,300
Since you've read it,

372
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,380
you should know

373
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,300
it's all about me.

374
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,700
It has nothing to do with you.

375
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,460
It's useless even if you take it away.

376
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,780
Take it away?

377
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,260
Why do you think of me so much?

378
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,700
Jiaojiao,

379
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,940
I've told you

380
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,580
my life

381
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,020
has never had a higher rank.

382
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,260
Only this

383
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,740
can be relied on.

384
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,500
