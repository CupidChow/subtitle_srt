1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is he back?

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're his nanny.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He'll be back.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't be afraid, nanny.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He knows you're a servant.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He loves the fish soup I make the most.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Remember it after I die.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Nanny.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nanny.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Father.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you sad?

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
since I was a kid,

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
nanny took care of me.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If he died,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I should have cried.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But I didn't cry.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They said I was a cold-blooded monster.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is that true, father?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Only incompetent people have a lot of feelings.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just a servant.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Just find a replacement.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't think about useless things.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I understand, father.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I didn't expect a powerful person

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
who can control everything

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
would be so fragile.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Channiang.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Channiang.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Right.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's his nanny.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The heroine felt her childhood wound.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She didn't see her last face.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What made her so sad?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What made her die?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't remember.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I created your pain.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who are you?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I...

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm Jiang Jiaojiao.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Who are you?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I...

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I...

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She looks so poor.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't care if Jiang Song is telling the truth.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm the heroine.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can attack her.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm Jiang Song.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mr. Sui.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I thought you left.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm back.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Aren't you mad at me?

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You just don't know how to love someone.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're not wrong.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let me warm you up.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll teach you how to love someone.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Young Mistress.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Young Mistress, you must be hungry.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Eat something.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll take care of the husband.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Try it.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Does it suit your taste?

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Not bad.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But it's not as good as yours.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I made it?

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You mentioned that

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
your fish cake is like the one of Mrs. Chan.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Cui Youan

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
transferred her feelings to Jiang Song, right?

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If I can make this fish cake,

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
will she treat me differently?

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll try it.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sir.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can this pill

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
help me get over my illness?

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is the elixir given by God Bi.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It can cure all illnesses.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then,

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the prediction you made...

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is also God Bi's.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It won't be wrong.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Your Majesty.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
General Shen wants to see you.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Shen Quan.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Back then, Yao Xiaozhi told the late crown prince

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,580
to raise three thousand Night

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The real man predicted

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that the Cloud Courier would be re-released

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
in the capital.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If it falls into the hands of the rebels,

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
there will be endless trouble.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Where is the woman?

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But the real man predicted that

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
in two days,

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the woman will be in prison.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then I'll start from the woman

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
who broke the rules these two days

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and find out the Cloud Courier.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
General Shen.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let the Cloud Courier

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
disappear with the woman.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The Cloud Courier

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The criminals of today's meal

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
are all here.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Of course,

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
there will be more criminals in prison tomorrow.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Eunuch Duanming.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Can you give me some more time?

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I must find out which woman it is.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's better to kill three thousand people

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
than to let one go.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Your adoptive father has always been like this.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How can the general be soft-hearted?

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If the woman doesn't die for a day,

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the emperor will be in trouble.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But most of these women

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
didn't commit any crimes of evil.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
General, do you have

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
a few more ghosts under your knife?

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Are you afraid of having more of these?

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fish cake. Fish cake.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Fresh fish cake.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Fish cake.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you want fish cake?

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Big meat.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Try it.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Newly made big meat.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What does the food taste like?

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ginger.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why are you back?

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I went to the city gate

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and found that I couldn't escape at all.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You know why, right?

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I know.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why?

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can tell you,

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but you have to do me a favor first.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Teach me how to make lotus fish cake.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I heard that what you made

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
is very similar to Cui Youan's.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I learned this fish cake.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Maybe Cui Youan will transfer

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
his feelings to me.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You hope so, too, right?

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Fish cake.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's time to tell me.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have to wait for Cui Youan to taste it

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and tell you if it tastes good.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I knew you would cheat.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I haven't taught you a step.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You...

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll give you all the secret recipe

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
when you tell me.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I have to wait for me to come back.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
By the way,

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you borrowed my money

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
when you just came to this world.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Two times the return.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You are stealing.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Actually,

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I do owe you an apology.

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll take the money

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
as compensation for you.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You are a good girl.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't turn around.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Cui Youan is behind you.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Jiang Song.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Wait for me over there.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll block her.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
My husband.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why are you here?

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I know you will go to Tianqing Temple

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
every month.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So I'm waiting for you here.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Zhijiu said

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you love lotus fish cake most.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I made some.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Cui Youan said

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the lotus fish cake I made

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is like your old friend's cooking.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So I made some.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How did you learn it?

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I tried it on the top.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've learned it for a long time.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Maybe it's not good enough.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm too stupid.

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Does it hurt?

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You don't have to learn it anymore.

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The world is gone.

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you still like it?

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you still like it?

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Will you like me?

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What should I do

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to make you like me?

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Tell me.

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can learn everything.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
As long as you're obedient,

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you'll always be the young mistress of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can't stand you.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to have a little more.

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I want to have a little more.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want to have a little more.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't grab it.

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I want to have a little more.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you, sister.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Here you are.

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,960
You want to know the truth of this world?

222
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
Of course.

223
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay, I'll tell you.

224
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
Why?

225
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Madam Cui, it was she who stole your wallet, right?

226
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Yes.

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,000
The wallet is on her.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
The seal of the Prime Minister's Manor is also inside.

229
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Why?

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
It's the Prime Minister's Manor's property.

231
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,800
There are evidence and evidence.

232
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
What else do you have to say?

233
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
I didn't want to do this.

234
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
But you can't escape from this city.

235
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Then you can only disappear.

236
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,200
This way, Cui You'an can see me.

237
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Why can't I escape from this city?

238
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,200
What is it outside the city?

239
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Even if you burn my books, you can't beat me.

240
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
You can't beat me.

241
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm not afraid of you.

242
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
You can't beat me.

243
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Because...

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Go.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Tell me why.

246
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Let go of me.

247
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Tell me why.

248
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Tell me why.

249
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,800
Jiang Jiang Jiang.

250
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Because I'm the author of this novel.

251
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,200
The plot is in my mind.

252
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
After the third prince ascended the throne, he was in a coma.

253
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
But he was pushed to the throne by Anbei.

254
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,400
And I will become the empress.

255
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,600
The drunk women of these two days are all here.

256
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
It's a great honor to see you, General Shen.

257
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,800
How could it be Lady Jiang?

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,600
What? You know this woman?

259
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,400
If you want to protect her, I can report to His Majesty.

260
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
No need.

261
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,600
I don't know her.

262
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
Really?

263
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,000
If so, I'll deal with her.

264
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
She looks like a guest.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,600
She's never served anyone before.

266
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,800
What a pity.

267
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,400
Eunuch.

268
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
What?

270
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
A drunk woman?

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I can't touch her?

272
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,600
Or do you mean

273
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,200
I don't deserve to touch a woman?

274
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,400
What are you doing? Let me go.

275
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Let go.

276
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Let me go.

277
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,800
Let go.

278
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Let go.

279
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
General, she's trying to kill you.

280
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Let me go.

281
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Let go.

282
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Let go.

283
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
General Shen.

284
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,800
If you want to protect her, you're against His Majesty.

285
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,000
Have you thought it through?

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
You misunderstood.

287
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,400
But this woman is my type.

288
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,600
I wonder if you can love her.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,600
You want to taste her?

290
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,800
Yes.

291
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,000
You're a man of high blood. I can't love you.

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,400
Guards, arrange for the General.

293
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,400
What's going on?

295
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
The battle is over.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,400
Jiang Song won't show up.

297
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
He and I have a lifetime.

298
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
We can take our time.

299
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,200
How did he learn?

300
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,200
My Lady!

301
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,240
late

302
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,840
placed

303
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,860
She just wanted to tell you

304
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,320
that her husband and son

305
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,440
were as well

306
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,900
as me

307
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,940
Okay

308
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,780
then

309
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,400
that means

310
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,360
you make an alliance with Zhengyang

311
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,280
to kill your family

312
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,520
YouNian

313
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,740
Your brother will move out

314
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Maybe you can have me in your heart.

315
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,740
Godfather,

316
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,340
why did it become a good thing to interrogate that dead man?

317
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,540
What do you know?

318
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,340
Shen Que is not a middle-aged man.

319
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,540
His Majesty wanted her to catch the criminal,

320
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,940
so he wanted to test her loyalty.

321
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,540
When he got the girl,

322
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,140
I just took a handful of her.

323
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,540
From now on,

324
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,740
he must give me three times more.

325
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,540
You're still a godfather.

326
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
Didn't you say you were leaving?

327
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,340
Why are you back?

328
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,740
I found that I can't leave.

329
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,740
Why?

330
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,540
I don't know.

331
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I don't know either.

332
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
So I came back

333
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
to find someone to answer.

334
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,940
So you got yourself here?

335
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,140
Forget it.

336
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
It has nothing to do with me.

337
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,340
Do you know what crime

338
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,540
those girls committed?

339
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,740
For the sake of the Tiger's Tally,

340
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,940
it's okay to kill innocent people?

341
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,340
Why?

342
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,340
You're not that kind of person.

343
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,540
What kind of person do you think I am?

344
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,940
The knife in my hand

345
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,740
cut off countless heads,

346
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,540
so I got it today.

347
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,340
I'm not like some young man who raised his father and respected Chu You.

348
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,740
He cares about morality,

349
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,140
etiquette and manners.

350
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,540
Why?

351
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,940
Are you disappointed

352
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,340
to see my real face?

353
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,940
For the Tiger's Tally,

354
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
I don't care about those lives.

355
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Including you,

356
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
it's not an exception.

357
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,140
But aren't you saving me now?

358
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
You're thinking too much.

359
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,140
What are you doing?

360
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,540
Are you serious?

361
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,140
What else?

362
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,140
