00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Harder, Madam!

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Harder!

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Harder!

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The son of the Holy Heir is breathing!

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Come out!

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Come out!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Come out!

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go!

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll go and thank your mother-in-law first!

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Father, Mother, he...

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sister!

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sister!

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When everyone was happy for the new birth,

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the dead body of my father, Guo Lingling,

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
was left alone.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It seemed that he was born

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:52,020
to be a

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
child.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He was blessed by his sister.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think he was born to be a child.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mother, do you agree?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Run!

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What a lucky man!

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I want to go out!

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Stop!

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let me out!

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Go back with me!

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mother, I don't want to be like the traitors of the Zhao State.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Go back with me!

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't want to!

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Jiaojiao,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
this is the life of a woman.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The traitors of the Zhao State are like this.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The same is true for mother.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You...

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You will be like this too.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Do you hear me?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go!

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't believe what mother said.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I must escape.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So you can even give up your life?

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I might have left with you five years ago.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But now,

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to find myself.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've been looking for you all these years.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
At first, I wanted to take revenge on you.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But then I panicked.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was afraid.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I was afraid that I would never find you again.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But now I've found you.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I didn't expect that

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you wouldn't wait for me anymore.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm afraid that

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
you won't be able to find me again.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm afraid that

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you won't be able to find me again.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Where are you going?

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When the butterflies were singing the same song,

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
a bride escaped from the city.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Someone said that she became an immortal.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Someone said that she became a ghost.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I want to see the answer myself.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What about after she escaped from the city?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What about after she escaped from the city?

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you sure about the future?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Of course.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
As long as I can control my life,

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sure.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is my daydream.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can only believe that

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
there is no limit to freedom outside the city.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't have any hope.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Shen Que,

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm different from you.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I've been chasing the moon all my life.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's just a momentary view of your blade.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's just a momentary view of your blade.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're in the north and south,

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you've seen the long river and the lonely smoke of the desert.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But my moon

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is always framed in the small

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
four-way heaven.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Men prefer to study

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and retreat from the battlefield.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But I don't want to be a man.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Because women

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
should have their own way.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But I don't want to be a man.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There is a way for women.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
People have sealed our way.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll go and try again.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What a pity.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You caught me.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I seem to be

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
always a little unlucky.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Jiang Song,

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you go.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The road ahead is slow.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Since you decide to go alone,

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I won't see you off.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This time, it won't be a little worse.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go catch your moon.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll go.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll go.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Actually, I never thought about

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
whether I wanted to find you

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
or give myself an answer.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're right.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I should have it in the future.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why should I be obsessed with you?

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
People will change.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But the trial five years ago

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
didn't want me to force you.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll go.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Take care.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Take care.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Take care.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Master, over there.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Master, it's the blessing of the prison.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where is he?

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Where is he?

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The river is in a mess.

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm afraid he's going to the lower part of the river to catch the body.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You mean

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
he's dead?

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Master, spare my life.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You want to die?

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not that easy.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There's a letter in the wedding dress.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Cui Youan's relatives.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I was raped.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was kidnapped and married.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you know

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
where you're smarter than them?

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're more hypocritical.

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You threw away

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
a letter to a higher-ups.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I should have saved you.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm honored to be chosen by you.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Even if you're a traitor

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and a traitor

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you can't win

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
in this world.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're powerless in this world.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll die today

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and be reborn today.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you read this letter

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you'll win the hunting.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're not the one who controls me.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm the one who controls you.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Cui Youan

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you lost.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
For the sake of the family

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you even gave up your life.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Did I lose?

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What a joke.

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What a joke.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Don't worry. We'll do our best.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Forget it.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I messed up.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's just a corpse.

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What's going on?

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why is the bride waiting?

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The groom is just a nobody.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How can he leave?

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah. The guests are all gone.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's been a long time.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's embarrassing.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's embarrassing.

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No. I won't make a mistake.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Now Jiang Song is dead.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm married.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Although the process is a bit rough

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it's the same as the story.

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Cui Youan will fall in love with me.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We'll be happy.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Her direction won't change.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm so happy.

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Take the bride away and rest.

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm back.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Zhe Xiang, the bride is here.

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Look. My husband is back.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's continue.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
First bow to the heaven and earth.

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Second bow to the parents.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Bow to each other.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Bow to each other.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Madam Jiang.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're here to marry me.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What's going on?

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Take her away.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Your Highness.

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Your Highness.

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What's going on?

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The wedding day is like this.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Your Highness.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're a loser.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're a loser.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
A loser.

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ridiculous.

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
A loser.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
A small river.

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
A small butterfly.

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Flies over the Guanyin River.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
In the distance.

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's so beautiful.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But A'Liang.

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm different from you.

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I will escape.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Go.

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
A'Di.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is that you?

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll take you with me.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll take you with me.

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Escape from this old man.

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Get out.

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What's this?

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
A'Di.

230
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
A'Di.

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A'Di.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What's this?

233
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
A'Di.

234
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
A'Di.
