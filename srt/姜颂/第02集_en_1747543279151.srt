00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Lady Jiang.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're not thinking straight.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The God of Deity won't stand by your side.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Lord Cui.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Lady Jiang.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why are you here?

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm here to offer incense.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Lord Cui.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have something to tell you.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lady Jiang, please.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They all say

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I used your heart to make my dream come true.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They say I'm a lowly woman

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and have a high-spirited heart.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They're talking nonsense.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They're talking nonsense.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everyone comes and goes alone.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The so-called top-class family looks glorious.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But it's normal to be defeated.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If I didn't take advantage of the family affairs,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
what kind of man am I?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I made a mistake.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You really don't mind?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What mistake did you make?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your uncle was more reluctant to marry you than you were.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He had no choice but to marry you.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They were the ones who made the mistake.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You have too many difficulties in this world.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Buddha said,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm the most ordinary woman.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm willing to do everything to help you.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please forgive me.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Everyone is suffering.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why do you have to forgive me?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because you've hurt everyone.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Buddha is above.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If your heart wants to succeed,

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you can't forget it.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Of course.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll send you back.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not yours.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can't get it no matter how hard you want to.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I've never seen a woman like you.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A woman who is like a woman.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She's beautiful and elegant.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She's fearless.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She doesn't need to be afraid.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In your life,

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
are you living a free life?

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's great.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I've never left this city.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's hard to live here like a human being.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't blame the bad environment.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sometimes,

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you have to think about yourself.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Are you kind enough?

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you always help others?

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because I'm not kind enough to be bullied.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Interesting.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to see

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
how you can use kindness to change others.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm scared to death.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This subordinate is too cruel.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Kindness reminds you

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that this is not a game.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you lose,

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you will die.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If he does this to the consort,

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
he will harm more people.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm scared.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm scared.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm scared of more people.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Sister, eat.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's wrong?

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Nothing.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Ji Yuan Lang,

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
you dare not pay

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
my gambling debt?

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're not a man.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm a man.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You dare not pay?

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When my sister enters the house,

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll give you money.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Come on.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How much gambling can the house

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
let this poor uncle?

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Listen.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've calculated.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Your sister and my son are in love.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let her marry my son.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Gambling debt is very effective.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Otherwise,

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
everyone will know

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
your ugly things.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Your son?

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Isn't your son already...

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
dead?

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What are you thinking about, brother?

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Nothing.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's been acting impolitely and boldly these days.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's not like my sister.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why don't you hand him over?

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sister,

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I saw a game outside.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you want to go and have a look?

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Of course.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm so bored.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Go.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If I go out of this door,

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll be tied to a wedding.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
My dear brother.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You...

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What do you mean you?

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Call me sister.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Sister.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sister, you have to save me.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Sister, open the door.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sister, do you know?

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That woman seems to be good at gambling.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She's probably a witch.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And she said

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
she wanted Li Yuanyuan to kill me.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have to save me.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Get out.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not a witch.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm a man.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm a man.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm a man.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Wait.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She took the money in your money house

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to please the people of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You don't care about that?

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Where is she?

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What a beautiful bride.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who are you?

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Bridegroom.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Li Yuanyuan.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Tell the witch to sell me out.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Women should have a family

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to decide their marriage.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Your brother has agreed.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm a man.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm not a wound.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You sold a lot of money.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're contented, right?

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're really like a woman.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What a pity for my son.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Madam, we're both women.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let me go, okay?

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Shut up.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What are you?

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's your bad luck to serve my son.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Madam, the time has come.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let me go.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go back, go back.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hurry.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Amazing.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,120
It seems you really

164
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
have bought money.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Please let my brother go.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So he can earn more.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He threw away a sacrifice.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're such a liar.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You took a prick for the wedding.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Go back to find our bridegroom.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay,

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
call me.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Go.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Come inside.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Wait.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This room this big

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
is what you deserve.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't blame me.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Bow to each other.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Jiu Jiu.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's wrong, my lady?

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Go prepare the carriage. I'm going out.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's late at night.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Go.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you laughing at?

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
On my wedding day,

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
shouldn't I laugh?

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I should call you two eunuchs and aunts.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's good that you've thought it through.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a blessing to be able to become a family with you two.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Enough.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Continue.

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't waste time.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Enter the bridal chamber.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let go.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll do it myself.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll do it myself.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Master,

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Shen Quezi came to the capital to get the wedding dress.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
His name is the enemy of the border.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He's actually a spy.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The Third Prince and the Prime Minister are very worried.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's a wedding.

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You don't have to mind it.

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Master.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Cui Youan.

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're awake.

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're awake.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're awake.

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're awake.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You're awake.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Cui Youan.

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How dare you!

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Cui Youan.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're so anxious.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Go away.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
My wife is not very obedient.

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Shut up.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You know the rules.

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She's a girl.

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can't coax me.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Life is short.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Why don't you do something interesting?

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're drunk.

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Cui Youan.

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're so pretty.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're like the moon in the sky.

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But you're pretty.

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But you're a little cold.

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Please be careful.

233
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Cui Youan.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to tell you a secret.

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What?

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is my first kiss.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Shi Jiao.

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Take her back.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I...

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Go.

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I won't go back.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Cui Youan.

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let me go.

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let me go.

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Cui Youan.

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Where are we?

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm in a hurry to see your dead husband.

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're in the north street.

250
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Sangqiao.

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Get out of the way.

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Who dares to stop our Li Yuan's family's wedding?

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you a soldier?

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I want to ask for help.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The situation is good.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Who would care about a woman at this time?

257
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Of course I don't care.

258
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But...

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
North street.

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Purple stone.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Soldier.

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Right now.

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Guards.

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's time to go.

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Tang Tianyi's son.

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Li Tiandan's son.

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The world is in danger if we kill him.

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You want to die?

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What kind of magic is that?

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You want to kill us?

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Shut up.

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Father, mother.

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't you miss your son?

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll send you to see him now.

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The king's son is dead.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We must find him.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Open the door and let him shut up.

278
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hurry up.

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hurry up.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Come on.

281
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you want to die,

282
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
die together.

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Don't think about living.

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Shut up, you bitch.

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Guards.

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Rebellion.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Rebellion.

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You read it correctly.

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes.

290
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's your crime?

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
According to the law of our country,

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
those who rebel

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
will be beheaded.

294
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You're not afraid of death?

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I am.

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But I'm more afraid of my enemy.

297
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
General.

298
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This woman is crazy.

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She has nothing to do with me.

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm willing to be the judge.

301
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm willing to prove my innocence.

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Li Wu Zheng.

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You don't remember me?

304
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've been looking for you for many years.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The night of the letter box three years ago,

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I found you.

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You were running away,

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and someone was sneaking into our rear.

309
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The guard at the gate of the imperial gate was killed.

310
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You...

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You've got the wrong person.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I remember the face of the enemy

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
after many years.

314
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Kill him.

315
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Master.

316
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Master.

317
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Master.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Shen Juan.

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Master.

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Your eyes

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
look like an old friend of mine.

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
General Wang.

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
For the sake of you,

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and the old stone,

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll let the woman live.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You want to live?

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes. I want to live.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
For living,

329
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
can you sacrifice everything?

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Why?

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Nothing is more important than me living.

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
looks like her.

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
My life

336
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
is in your mind.

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Please show me your face.

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you don't go,

339
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
the old friend you look like

340
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
will have a grudge against me.

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Master.

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Mr. Cui.

343
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I didn't see him.

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
General Shen.

345
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,440
Just kidding.

346
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,080
Sorry.

347
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,280
You just returned to the capital.

348
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,560
You know it.

349
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,760
Please be careful.

350
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,280
Yes.

351
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm a man of my word.

352
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,320
I have no roots.

353
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,280
You are the most important person in the world.

354
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,240
Thank you for your consideration.

355
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,360
Unduechuckling

356
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,680
leave now.

357
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,160
I'm fine.

358
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,440
It's not my blood.

359
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,720
I'll give you a ride home.

360
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,920
Okay.

361
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,320
The truth ANYONE,

362
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,520
and anyone ever cares about,

363
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,680
be sure to find it yourself!

364
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,040
Childe Cui didn't stay

365
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,060
with the last General.

366
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,800
Have you ever heard

367
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,840
Cui You'ai!

368
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,040
Shi Jiu, let me go!

369
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,400
Why don't you go back?

370
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,160
Cui You'ai,

371
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,920
I just kissed you.

372
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,000
Why are you hiding?

373
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
I was careless.

374
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,040
What?

375
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,560
I was the one who took the initiative.

376
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,640
What's wrong?

377
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,680
You...

378
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,680
It's the first time

379
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,440
I've seen you angry.

380
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm not.

381
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
I met him at Guan Yin Bridge.

382
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
I found him drunk.

383
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,360
So I ordered Shi Jiu to send him back.

384
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,400
So you're câmera

385
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:41,880
treatment.

386
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,000
