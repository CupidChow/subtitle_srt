00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Run.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Why are you running, Jiang Liangzi?

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I...

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's okay.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Just go back with me.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She's going with me.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're looking for death?

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of death.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let go.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let go.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let go.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let go.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I...

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry, Jiang Liangzi.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Mr. Cui.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to talk to you first.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You have to be careful.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's dangerous.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Did you see a bird called a devil?

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I fed the devil,

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and ate the yellow croaker.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
When I was a child,

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
my father told me about a devil.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He could eat fish every day,

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
I was the devil.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
I know your pain.

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,160
I won't let your mother and brother

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
bully you again.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,880
No.

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,240
You don't understand.

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
I am a devil,

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,040
but I don't suffer for it.

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,520
If I let her go,

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
she can go to heaven and earth.

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
The devil is right.

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,320
Why should she be pitiful?

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,960
You read the holy books.

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Tell me.

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,840
It's the fish that the fish took.

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,200
The fish that the fish took.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
The fish that the fish took.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
The fish that the fish took.

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,720
The fish that the fish took.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,000
The fish that the fish took.

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Of course it's the devil.

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,720
If so,

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,160
I finally got the rope

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,280
and found the fish.

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,640
Why did you

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
bring me into the cage?

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm different from them.

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
I will protect you.

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,680
Your protection

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
is the most terrible rope.

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm afraid you misunderstood.

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
We are here alone.

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,560
Why don't you be honest?

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,800
What do you mean?

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,320
I didn't

65
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,800
give the medicine to Mr. Cui.

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
The medicine is

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
your hand.

68
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
But he is innocent.

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
He shouldn't be punished.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
You found it?

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,280
You are very interesting

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
as a toy.

73
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
But you are too smart.

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,280
You found it long ago.

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Why did you say so?

76
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
I didn't remember it very well at first.

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
I thought I was really scared.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,080
Until later,

79
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,520
my memory was not clear enough.

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
I was afraid that

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
I would be too scared.

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,800
I was afraid that

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I would be too scared.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I was afraid that

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I would be too scared.

86
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I was afraid that

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I would be too scared.

88
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I was afraid that

89
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I would be too scared.

90
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,760
Then my memory became clearer.

91
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,800
But you are very scheming.

92
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,480
You are very powerful.

93
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,720
I can only pretend not to remember.

94
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,120
I was with you

95
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
and tried to escape.

96
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,800
Escape?

97
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,520
Escape to Shen Que?

98
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm afraid he has already

99
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
hated you.

100
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,680
He thought you betrayed him

101
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
to betray me.

102
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
You failed to help your fiance

103
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
to get rid of me.

104
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Are you disappointed?

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
You did it.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
I wanted to beat him and Zhao Chengze

107
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
into a fight.

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
But I underestimated him.

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
But I advise you

110
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
to stop thinking about him.

111
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
It has nothing to do with him.

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
I have reminded you four times.

113
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Buddha is above.

114
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
You can't forget him.

115
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Before the wedding,

116
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,280
I asked you to make another choice.

117
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,080
Why are you so stubborn?

118
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,480
I'm the only one who can stop this game.

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
What right do you have?

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
What right do you have?

121
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
But why did you choose me?

122
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
You really don't remember.

123
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,600
My lady, it's so cold.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Yes, let's go home.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Help me.

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,000
My lady, he...

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
He seems to be badly injured.

128
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Did you find him?

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
No.

130
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Help me to distract them.

131
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
This is yours.

132
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Let's go around.

133
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Go.

134
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
My lady, help me.

135
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,800
It's okay if you are a little cat and dog.

136
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Can you help anyone who is unknown?

137
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Be careful of fire.

138
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Go.

139
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
Little cat and dog.

140
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
Do you know who I am?

141
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I bought a lot of you.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
I don't know who you are.

143
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't want to know who you are.

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't think your life is worth more than mine.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
My life is priceless.

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,800
My lady, that gold medicine is not cheap.

147
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
So you marry me

148
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
to take revenge on me.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Take revenge on me?

150
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
You look down on yourself.

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm just a obedient pet.

152
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
Let's see how much you will sell yourself.

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
You surprised me.

154
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Even the position of the prime minister and the young lady can't buy you.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,200
I can give you whatever you want.

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Are you not satisfied with the end of the medicine group?

157
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
You are the one in the medicine group.

158
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Mr. Xue.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Who allowed you to touch him?

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
I didn't.

161
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
Let me go, okay?

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,200
This money can sell yourself.

163
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
No.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No.

165
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Mr. Xue.

166
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Mr. Xue.

167
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
The arrangement of the bride

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
is the last resort of the prime minister.

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
You know the temper of the prime minister.

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
If you keep doing this,

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm afraid...

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,200
Okay.

173
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
It's almost time.

174
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You can go back to your mansion.

175
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
The prime minister is waiting.

176
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Look, I won.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why are you laughing?

178
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes, you won.

179
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
Fortunately, you came.

180
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

181
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
I didn't want to see you.

182
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

183
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Thank you.

185
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
Thank me?

186
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,800
I took everything from you.

187
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,600
Thank me?

188
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Really?

189
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Jiaojiao.

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
Did you really take it?

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What do you mean?

192
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Have you ever thought about

193
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,800
your brother is a widow and your mother is a partial person?

194
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,800
The unmarried man is a man with a thin skin.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,400
Why should I steal from you?

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
I just want you to think

197
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
they deserve to be robbed.

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,400
Jiang's family is my first cage.

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Cui Youan is the second.

200
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,000
You don't know how many times I prayed

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
for someone to replace me.

202
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,600
So when you appeared from the fire,

203
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
I didn't feel scared, but...

204
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
I was so excited.

205
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,400
Then I prayed for you to disappear

206
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,200
and I got a high price.

207
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I got the money.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That means you won't disappear.

209
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
And I

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
won't marry Cui Youan.

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
What do you mean by that?

212
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
You are clearly

213
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,000
the first one in my life to get a high price.

214
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
You didn't let me down.

215
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,600
You gave a speech at the banquet.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
When the Empress invited you,

217
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,000
and now the Prime Minister chose you,

218
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
then Cui Youan

219
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
can't help but choose you.

220
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,800
That's impossible.

221
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm not going to marry Cui Youan.

222
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm not going to marry Cui Youan.

223
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
That's impossible.

224
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,400
Cui Youan is kind and upright.

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
But you said she was a beast.

226
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
You are jealous of me.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You lied.

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
You are jealous of me.

229
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Princess, you...

230
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Father values her so much.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
She can change her face in one night.

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I want to see

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
if she really has a supernatural power.

234
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
It seems that unless I die,

235
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
she won't let me go.

236
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
What are you doing?

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Now I only have one last way to go.

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Jiaojiao,

239
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,200
let me help you again.

240
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,400
After today,

241
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
you are me.

242
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Thank you,

243
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,200
for becoming me.

244
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Jiao Song!

245
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Jiao Jiao!

246
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Jiao Jiao!

247
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Jiao Song!

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Jiao Jiao!

249
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Jiao Song!

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Go down and find her.

251
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Yes.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,800
Master,

253
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
do we need to go to the cliff

254
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
to find the lady?

255
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Master.

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Will she be alive

257
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
if we fall down?

258
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm afraid so.

259
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,000
She is in danger.

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
What are you looking for?

261
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,000
Master.

262
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Wu Jun.

263
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
You come?

264
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Jiao Song!

265
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Jiao Song!

266
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Jiao Song!

267
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,440
Archimedes bloom and wither

268
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,540
In the dark, I always try to find you

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,800
Courtesy of bird and butterfly

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,240
You are free, excavator

271
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,240
and Torrentic Head light in thenego.

272
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,260
My notice is to say

273
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,880
that all traitors

274
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,880
can be saved.

275
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,040
No.

276
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,300
Due to late phone calls

277
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,680
with other passers-by,

278
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,060
I plan to give Sa Moci

279
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,060
I'll take Madam Jiang back to prepare the wedding.

280
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,060
I only got one steamed bun today.

281
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,860
I'm so hungry. I ate half of it.

282
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm sorry, Mother.

283
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Why are you crying?

284
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,860
Please spare my life, Sir!

285
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,860
I didn't mean to offend you.

286
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,860
I didn't mean to offend you.

287
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,860
Tell me, why are you crying?

288
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
My mother is dead.

289
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,460
I can't see her again.

290
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,860
So what if she's dead?

291
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,860
Tell me!

292
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,860
She's dead. I can't see her smile at me.

293
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,860
Madam Jiang.

294
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Mr. Cui.

295
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,860
I can't see her again.

296
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,860
I can't see her smile at me.

297
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,860
I can't see her smile at me.

298
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,860
I can't see her smile at me.

299
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,860
I can't hear her call my name.

300
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,860
I can't hear her call my name.

301
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Mr. Cui.

302
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Mr. Cui.

303
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Madam.

304
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,860
I can't see her again.

305
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,860
I can't hear her call my name.

306
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,860
Who can understand my heart?

307
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,860
In every scenery,

308
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,860
there is her name.

309
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Waiting for my love to rain.

310
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
Xiaosong!

311
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
Xiaosong!

312
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,860
Xiaosong!

313
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
Xiaosong!

314
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
Xiaosong!

315
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Xiaosong!

316
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Xiaosong!

317
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Xiaosong!

318
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,860
Xiaosong!

319
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
What the hell?

320
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
I'm here, I've found you.

321
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,860
I'm here, I've found you.

322
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Xiaosong!

323
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,860
I need a hug.

324
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Xiaosong!

325
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Xiaosong!

326
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,780
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
I thought you were going to marry Cui You'an.

328
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,060
I was so angry.

329
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,140
Come home with me, okay?

330
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,020
I don't have a home anymore.

331
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,660
If you want to...

332
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,580
I don't want to.

333
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,300
What about me?

334
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,660
Your future is limitless.

335
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,860
Why are you so obsessed with me?

336
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,380
Jiao Cong.

337
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
I won't turn back.

338
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,540
I won't stop.

339
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,060
You don't know how long I've been waiting.

340
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,860
I'm not afraid of you.

341
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,860
My escape

342
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,860
started long, long ago.

343
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,140
Can't you See
