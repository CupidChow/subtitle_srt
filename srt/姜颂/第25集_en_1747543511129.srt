1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Doctor Li, how is General?

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll give General a few shots first.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Look at my skills.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I really forgot to bring it.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please go to the clinic and get me the needle.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
As a doctor who saves people, how can you kill people?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I killed the person I should kill.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How dare you be so impudent!

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Zhang Chao, do you still remember?

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When someone in the village of Tuolin

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
was hiding the scouts of the Lake,

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you actually killed the whole village.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The whole village was in shock.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My daughter is among them.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And her eight-year-old son.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And so many innocent people.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you remember what happened?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I killed so many people.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't care about them.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Good and evil are always rewarded.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Even if I can't take the responsibility today,

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
your body won't last for a few days.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
At least you'll die before me.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Shen Quan, kill him.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Do it.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Father, he's a doctor.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why don't you charge into the army?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you also think I should die?

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I gave my life to him.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Not only your life.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If it weren't for me,

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
would you have the achievement today?

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now this person wants to kill me.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What should you do?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Kill me.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Zhang Chao, you can't die.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't die.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you're not out of the tribe,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
our tribe will be in danger.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Zhang Chao, will never be put in this mess.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,760
Your Majesty!

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,280
Your Majesty!

48
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,120
Wan'an.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,000
Let him go.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,960
Father.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
How is the Prime Minister?

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,240
His Majesty ordered him to be sent to the mansion

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,400
under the order of Xiuyang

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,560
and sent people to keep an eye on him.

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm in the capital.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
Li Dacheng is training in the Eastern Camp.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
They won't be able to get away with it.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,920
If we don't have any time,

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,840
we must find the commandant of the Clouds as soon as possible

60
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
and make them a punishment.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,960
Tomorrow is the Spring Festival.

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,920
Keep an eye on them.

63
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,240
Yes.

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,440
Father.

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,000
After the Spring Festival,

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,440
I want to get married.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,480
I'm afraid that I'll be a burden to you.

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,440
Since you've made up your mind,

69
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,840
I have nothing to hide.

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,800
In fact, he was the one who asked me to save you.

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,480
What?

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,520
He stabbed you with a knife

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
and my reinforcements

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,720
ran away from those rebels.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,280
He ran with you and my team

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
all day and night

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,760
asking me to save you.

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,960
He also said that you know some martial arts

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,000
and knelt down to beg me to keep you.

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,720
He said that you can't

81
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,800
and asked me not to mention him in front of you.

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Why are you here?

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
What's wrong?

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,840
Nothing.

85
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,200
I just want to see you.

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,080
I won't let you go again in the future.

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,040
Don't think about the future.

88
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,320
It's good to have now.

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,800
Tomorrow is the Spring Festival.

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,680
I hope nothing will happen.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Stay at home these days.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
Miao Hua will take care of you.

93
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,320
I'll feel more at ease.

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,160
But I'm still a little worried.

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,720
Don't worry.

96
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,400
They haven't found the Clouds of Courage yet.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,640
They can't touch the Night Star Pavilion.

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,640
I can hold on.

99
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,880
What's wrong?

100
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,280
I'm afraid that I'll be a burden to you.

101
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,160
What's wrong?

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,240
Nothing.

103
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
With him by my side,

104
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,520
it's like you're by my side.

105
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,640
Let's go.

106
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,800
Shen Que.

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,360
I'll wait for you.

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,120
Wait for me.

109
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,760
Wait for me.

110
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
They've been playing chess these days.

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,320
It seems nothing is wrong.

112
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
No one is coming in or out.

113
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,320
They didn't say anything.

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,160
No.

115
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
It's not æ.

116
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,400
What's that smell?

117
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
The smell seems to be around.

118
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,280
It's a odor.

119
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,240
What is this?

120
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
General.

121
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,200
Yuan Hua.

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,640
What happened outside?

123
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,880
I don't know where many people came from.

124
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
They are going to the palace to kill.

125
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Is Ye Xing Ke?

126
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,720
General.

127
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,440
The general said to protect you.

128
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I'll go and have a look.

129
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,080
Ah.

130
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,520
Yuan Hua.

131
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
We've finally got to the end of the story.

132
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,960
Jiang Jiao Jiao.

133
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm not Jiang Jiao Jiao.

134
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,840
You are soon.

135
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,080
You don't even know the seven-seven.

136
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,320
Ye Xing Ke is divided into two.

137
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Half of them follow the order of Yun Yong.

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,040
The other half follow the order of Feng Qi.

139
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,880
Right.

140
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,400
The order of Feng Qi

141
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,720
is in the hands of the prime minister.

142
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,120
You mean

143
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
only half of the Ye Xing Ke

144
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,640
is in the mess now?

145
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Yes.

146
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
When we find Yun Yong,

147
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,840
Cui You An will be safe.

148
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
It's up to you.

149
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
What does it have to do with me?

150
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
Jiang Song can't find Yun Yong.

151
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
But Jiang Jiao Jiao knows where he is.

152
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,360
Don't you remember anything?

153
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,800
What!

154
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,920
I don't remember

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,560
anything at all.

156
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
Can't you remember anything?

157
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,680
In fact, you know me.

158
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,520
How could I possibly know you?

159
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,080
You've known me for a long time.

160
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I was born into this life.

161
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I'm leaving.

162
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,480
A little butterfly

163
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,480
flew over the Guanyin Bridge.

164
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,600
Are you running for the bride?

165
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
After I escaped from the city,

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
I still had nowhere to go.

167
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
God Bi saved me.

168
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
I had a new life

169
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
with this mask on.

170
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
You once killed yourself

171
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
to exchange for a dog's life.

172
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,480
No wonder you insisted on me being a Jiang Jiaojiao.

173
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Isn't it good to be a Jiang Jiaojiao?

174
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Look.

175
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
So many people died.

176
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
A city was destroyed.

177
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
A dynasty was destroyed.

178
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Just to fight for you.

179
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Just to break through your love story.

180
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
So many people died

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
because of me?

182
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
No.

183
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
This is not real.

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
This is a nightmare.

185
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
No.

186
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
This is a nightmare.

187
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Look.

188
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
This is the world of the heroine.

189
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
No killing,

190
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
pain,

191
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
ugly.

192
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Only flowers.

193
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
The man who loves you

194
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
is covering for you.

195
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
He is protecting you.

196
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
You just have to be a Jiang Jiaojiao.

197
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,160
You have a choice to be oppressed by the cruel truth.

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,600
You have to choose not to learn

199
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
something hidden from this flower beggar.

200
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,400
The guest who sets off 먹을

201
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,920
has not just the truth,

202
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
but there is pleased between us.

203
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,040
And the person who leaves his lovely home

204
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
and goes that way

205
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,040
can once again become a cool and precious more to you.

206
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,560
I spend the rest of them

207
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Why can't you live with yourself?

208
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Jiang Song.

209
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,520
Jiang Jiaojiao.

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Very well.

211
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,720
You are Jiang Jiaojiao.

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Think about where the Yunyong Order is.

213
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I will be there.

214
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

215
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
I will take care of my grandson.

216
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Cheng Ze, you were born in the royal family.

217
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,080
I hope you can live a safe life in the future.

218
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,080
You can't let anyone else take the throne.

219
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Maybe when the Yun Kai Wu San is over,

220
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
he can help you.

221
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
I remember it now.

222
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Where?

223
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
The Yunyong Order

224
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
is on the throne of Zhao Cheng Ze.

225
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
So fast.

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,080
The sun, the clouds and the clouds are all empty.

227
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Losing you is a lot of work.

228
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
No matter how busy I am, I have no worries.

229
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:58,080
I can't live up to my love.
