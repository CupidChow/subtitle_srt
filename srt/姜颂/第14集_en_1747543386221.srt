1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,220
Sorry!

2
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,240
Fine

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,320
That's the relation of bed and earth

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,600
Now we can go home to improve

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
General Shen

6
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,000
Go back with me

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,020
For rewards

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let us out.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Help.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Zeng Su.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let us out.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Zeng Su.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let us out.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where are we going?

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let us out.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
General Shen said that we were just pretending to be dead.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We lied to the old eunuch.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He took us away safely.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But why are we here?

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You believe Shen Que's words.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He is just playing with us.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I believe Shen Que.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He will definitely come to save us.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's find a way to get away from him.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What should we do now?

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's go together.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Go.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Be careful.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Go.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Protect the eunuch.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
General Shen, help me.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Go.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
General, let's go.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I can't catch it.

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Zeng Su.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
General Shen.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hurry up.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Save them first.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Go.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Go.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Go.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Go.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Go.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Go.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Go.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Go.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Go.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Go.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Go.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Go.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Go.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Go.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Be careful.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Go, go.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,860
Wait,

70
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,280
wait!

71
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,320
Flourish that lighter now.

72
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,520
Let's go.

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,520
Run!

74
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,400
Shen Que!

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,480
Zi Yuwen,

76
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,840
don't come over.

77
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Don't come over!

78
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,240
Jiansuo!

79
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Shen Que won't let you die.

80
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Come back with me.

81
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
I don't want to.

82
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,880
Fine.

83
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,960
Then all of them

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,440
will die.

85
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,920
General Chen, be careful!

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,520
Be careful!

87
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,040
Be careful!

88
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,240
Why

89
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,240
don't you let me go?

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,240
Because you're mine.

91
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,440
Do you love me?

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,960
No.

93
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,680
You're just a

94
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
heartless monster.

95
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,720
Enough!

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,120
It doesn't matter.

97
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,600
Do you know what love is?

98
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,440
The living can die.

99
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,520
The dead can live.

100
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
The hot can endure.

101
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,360
The hot can die.

102
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,720
Do you understand?

103
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,760
Why do I need to know

104
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
that kind of cowardly love?

105
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Shen Que loves you,

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,680
but he will die for you.

107
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,320
Zi Yu!

108
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Come back with me.

109
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,680
I'll let them go.

110
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm not yours.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm my own.

112
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,760
Power,

113
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
wealth,

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,160
power.

115
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,200
I have nothing

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,440
that can control Jiansuo.

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,560
Including you.

118
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
I'm not afraid of danger.

119
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
If you come any closer,

120
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,840
I'll jump off.

121
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,120
Don't play tricks on me.

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,800
I won't fall for it.

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,760
So,

124
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
this is him.

125
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,840
Jiang Song.

126
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,280
Jiang Song.

127
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,640
Are you okay?

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,760
I'm fine.

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
I'll kill him.

130
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
I'll kill him.

131
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,480
It's okay.

132
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,960
It's okay.

133
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I'll kill him.

134
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,800
No.

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,160
No.

136
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,240
No.

137
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,400
Jiang Song.

138
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,920
I'm here.

139
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,560
Shen Jun.

140
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm here.

141
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,680
Shen Jun.

142
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,920
Is everything over?

143
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
Everything is over.

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,560
I didn't protect you.

146
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,480
Don't say that.

147
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,360
You saved all of us.

148
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,760
You did a good job.

149
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Shen Jun.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,440
You didn't kill the innocent.

151
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,600
You didn't disappoint me.

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,200
Thank you.

153
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
I didn't kill the innocent.

155
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,040
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,200
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,120
If I'm not as good as you think,

159
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,560
how is she?

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,960
Her eyes were blurred at first.

161
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,280
But after she died,

162
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
her body became weak and toxic.

163
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,440
If it can't be cured,

164
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,200
she will die forever.

165
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,440
You saved her, right?

166
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,320
Amo.

167
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,640
You like her so much.

168
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,040
Don't you want her to be happy?

169
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,320
What about her?

170
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,680
Will she be happy?

171
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Will she be happy?

172
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,080
You...

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Stop it.

174
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,440
I thought...

175
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
I finally had someone to love.

176
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,720
I finally got cursed.

177
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,720
I finally got to be seen.

178
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,480
But...

179
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,120
I was ignored again.

180
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,160
I was bullied.

181
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,320
I was abandoned.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,760
Go away.

183
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,560
You can just go spend your days.

184
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
I won'tuesto with you.

185
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
Let's go.

186
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,640
Jiang Jiaojiao, you're awake.

187
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,000
You're going to save me?

188
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
I told you before you're the leading woman.

189
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,960
Of course, you can't die.

190
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,280
What else do you want?

191
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
is a more noble status.

192
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,680
I want

193
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,320
the life of Cui Youan.

194
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,680
He is the leading man.

195
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
No one can kill him.

196
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,200
Unless

197
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,760
he is willing to die.

198
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,640
I thought he could save me.

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
I didn't expect

200
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,360
he would kill me.

201
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,280
You didn't die.

202
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,400
Yes.

203
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,600
I shouldn't have died.

204
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,840
The antidote.

205
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
The antidote is here.

206
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,680
He wants to take it away.

207
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I don't want to die.

208
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,560
I don't want to die.

209
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
I don't want to die.

210
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
I don't want to die.

211
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
I don't want to die.

212
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
I don't want to die.

213
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,680
What's your condition?

214
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,200
You can't take back

215
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,760
all the love you have.

216
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,960
What's the point of doing this?

217
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,040
I want to see what Jiang Song said.

218
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,400
That great love.

219
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,240
If you're afraid,

220
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,720
you can turn around.

221
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,040
As for the antidote.

222
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,360
Okay.

223
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,080
You may have the antidote.

224
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,400
This treasure

225
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
was really some treat.

226
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,680
Miss Jiang,

227
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
you're awake.

228
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,400
Miao Hua, where's Shen Que?

229
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,360
He...

230
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,160
Don't tell him I went to get the antidote.

231
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,640
He went to catch the thief.

232
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,920
Miao Hua, tell me the truth.

233
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
Where did he go?

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,720
I...

235
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,840
Tell me.

236
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,520
The general went to get the antidote for you.

237
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,400
Mu!

238
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
Miss Jiang,

239
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,480
you're awake.

240
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
You're awake.

241
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,120
I...

242
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,680
I...

243
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,480
I...

244
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,040
I...

245
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,800
I...

246
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,400
I...

247
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,240
I...

248
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,920
I...

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,840
Miss Jiang,

250
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,320
can you stay for the general?

251
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,000
He's been alone

252
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,160
for years.

253
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,840
Shen Que,

254
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,960
even if you're destined to get the antidote,

255
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,360
he'll still leave.

256
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,640
Why bother?

257
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,920
Antidote?

258
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Fine.

259
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,800
I'll pay you back.

260
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,040
It sold out.

261
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,920
100 Vladimir's coronationィ

262
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,040
is a folly.

263
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,120
An island that you left behind

264
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,800
It's crying and touching

265
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,040
A fish swim in water

266
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
What a beautiful blue sea

267
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,880
This is ourselves

268
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,560
Staring at the battle

269
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,400
Colliding with the waves

270
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,400
Tied for lawful reasons

271
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,200
Travelling on the sea
