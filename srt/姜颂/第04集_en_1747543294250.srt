Episode 16

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let go!

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Mother!

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Mother!

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Come back!

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let go!

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You want to run away?

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I won't let you run away!

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Run!

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Go!

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let go of her!

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let go of her!

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're a bad girl!

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're a bad girl!

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let go of her!

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Get out of my way!

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You bitch!

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're a bitch!

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're a bitch!

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mother!

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wake up!

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't sleep!

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll take you to the doctor.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't sleep!

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't sleep!

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's go!

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No need.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm too tired.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've been

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
sold too many times

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to be a daughter.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Xiaoqi,

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I...

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I...

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I finally

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
can be myself this time.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My name is

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Father.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A little butterfly

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
flies over

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the Guanyin Bridge

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and returns

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to the garden.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Father,

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
wake up.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Father.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Father.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Wake up.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wake up.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Isn't she the crazy girl?

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
She's finally dead.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Please wake up, Father.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want her to be buried.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What a joke!

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A nameless bitch

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
can't even enter the ancestral hall.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She's buried?

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
She's a poor girl.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
She's been thrown into the abandoned funeral home.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Take her away!

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Please wake up, Father.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please wake up, Father.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No! No!

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Father!

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Please, Father!

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please!

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Get out of the way!

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you don't let go,

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll cut off your hands!

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
General Shen.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
General Shen.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You guys

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
don't report the crime.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Instead, you're here to be punished.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
General, you're wronged.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
According to the law of the dark fire,

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the bodies of the nameless people

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
are to be thrown into the abandoned funeral home.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This woman

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
is only to be buried.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
She's disrespectful to the law.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I beg you to show mercy.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll allow you to bury the victim.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why should I show mercy?

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You've been pursuing your brother for years.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You killed Li Wu Zhang.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You must be a man of revenge.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If...

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If...

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can avenge you?

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Shut up.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What revenge?

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You said last time

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that I'm like an old friend of yours.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If I can help you find her,

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
will you allow me to bury her?

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Will you?

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Sure.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Shen Jun.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Long time no see.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She killed my brother.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She's not my daughter.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
My brother is a good boy.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She's not my brother.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Mother.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You...

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're guessing

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
whether I'm a human or a ghost?

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You brought me into this world.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But I don't like it.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Before I leave,

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to see you.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Good boy.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't scare me.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Are you repenting

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
or

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
copying the king?

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why are you doing this to me?

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't you remember?

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You killed a demon.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's completely dead.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I almost died because of him.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You asked me to tolerate him.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was forced to marry by the Jiang family.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You asked me to accept my fate.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When the other Jiang family appeared,

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
you left him

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
because you have two daughters.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can help the Jiang family

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
to earn twice the capital.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Mother.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you really not recognize

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
who your daughter is?

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You've been pretending to see her.

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you really think

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't see through it?

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You've suffered a lot.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But if it weren't for you,

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
would I have suffered

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
so much in the Jiang family?

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Luckily, there's a demon

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
who made me live a happy life.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He could have been a fool.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,040
He could have destroyed the

149
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
You ruined it all.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is it my fault

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to be your daughter?

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not your fault.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But you're my daughter.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm in pain here.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You have to be with me.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The fate of a demon girl

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
is destined to be the same.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
One day,

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
you will become me.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You will understand me.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You're wrong.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I won't continue your secret.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You will rot in the

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Jiang family's cage.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But, mother,

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
look.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm a human,

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
not a demon.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm different from you.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I will escape.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Li.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't think about it.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't go.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can't go anywhere.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm still here.

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why should you go?

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're the beast

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that fell on me.

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You want to cut off our blood.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But it's not easy.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Our blood

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
has been cut off by you.

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Please.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Please don't go.

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Poor mother.

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mother, please.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Mother.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I once imagined

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
using my death

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to make you regret.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I know it's not worth it.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But life is the most precious thing

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I have.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But it won't happen again.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because I know

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you won't regret it.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Are you crazy?

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You...

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
How could this happen?

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How could this happen?

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can't kill me.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't live even if you kill me.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you crazy?

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
My face.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You said

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the most beautiful porcelain

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
is not worth it

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
even if it has a crack.

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're crippled.

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're worthless.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you crazy?

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What's the good for you?

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Your face is ruined.

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Jiaojiao.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We're different.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm a human.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm a beast.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm a human.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Not a porcelain.

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't need to be perfect.

222
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why are you so hurt

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
when you came back?

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Are you a human?

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't mind.

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're really hurt.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I want to get you out of the mouth.

228
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Is that all?

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
My name is Jiaojiao.

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No one to be born as a human.

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to be a real human.

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I wish you all the best.

233
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Jiaojiao,

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
thank you.

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,160
Retreat

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,800
I want to say.

237
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,000
Princess.

238
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
It's 자 embark kannst du.

239
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,520
Why did you see

240
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,180
Jiang Hua,

241
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,300
capable and kindhearted?

242
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,080
If you're going to grow up,

243
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,280
I know you went to a different place.

244
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,440
I'm here because

245
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,540
I really want to see Деду.

246
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,240
I really have to see him.

247
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,380
It is him!

248
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,140
This guy

249
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,640
wants to be dead,

250
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,280
but he doesn't know how to hide beatings.

251
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
I don't care about you.

252
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,480
Find another one.

253
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,880
My father is dead.

254
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
My uncle sold me to Zhuang Yan as a slave.

255
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I don't want to be a slave.

256
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,320
He doesn't care about you.

257
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,840
You lose.

258
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,880
Yes.

259
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,640
Zhuang Yan made a bet with me.

260
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,320
He said I could go home if I won.

261
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,440
I'm not betting on your life.

262
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm not treating you as a dog.

263
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,880
I bet on my life.

264
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,160
Please.

265
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,400
Please help me.

266
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,080
I can't live if you die.

267
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
But look.

268
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,160
The weather is good today.

269
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,360
Let's not die.

270
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,240
Let's live together.

271
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,240
Okay?

272
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,600
Two.

273
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,200
One.

274
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,280
Time's up.

275
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,400
You lose.

276
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,040
Zhuang Yan, break the bet.

277
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
Please help me.

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
Help me.

279
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,080
Please help me.

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,320
Help me.

281
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,240
Just die.

282
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,640
It's okay.

283
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,000
Help me.

284
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,080
Make it up to them.

285
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,880
One.

286
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,640
You!

287
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,080
What the heck?

288
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,920
the dreams and questions are lost.

289
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,720
Theeme preschool is over,

290
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,800
may the Dayton e cannons run wild.

291
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,560

00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,100
Fatty,

295
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,060
I'll beat this!

Li, Li, please forgive me.

301
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,160
Please let me go, ask for mercy.

302
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,760
What's going on?

303
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,740
Heart!

304
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,180
General, it fell!

305
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,500
It will climb up on its own.

306
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
There's no reaction.

307
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,320
I don't like this Battle Corridor moist.

308
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,060
We can use it to shieldan ourselves

309
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,120
and my master this time since it's pretty painful.

310
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,800
You're dead?

311
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,420
If you didn't die, then you may climb up.

312
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,260
I'm tired.

313
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,860
How about you bury me

314
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,440
right here?

315
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,380
I'll be in love with you for the rest of my life.
