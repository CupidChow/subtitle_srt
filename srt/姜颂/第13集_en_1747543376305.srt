00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,600
General, bad news.

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
The scout is here to report that

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Cui You An is having another wedding.

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
It's... it's with Lady Jiang.

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Could it be that Lady Jiang

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
really wants to marry into the Prime Minister's Manor?

10
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Why are you doing this to me?

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Let go of me!

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Master said

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
that this is a play for Jiang Song.

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
It's a live show.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
If you can't stand it,

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
leave the white cloth.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I'll let go. You pretend to be dead.

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Shi Jiu!

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
It hurts, Shi Jiu!

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Without my wisdom,

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
it's not important.

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
It hurts, Shi Jiu!

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
It hurts!

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
As long as you beg me,

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
you can take revenge.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
How do you feel?

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Not bad.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
But not enough to take revenge.

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I want to kill her myself.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Okay.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Jiang Song, I beg you.

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Don't kill me.

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I'll do it myself.

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Okay.

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Jiang Song.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I beg you, don't kill me.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
No.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
No.

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Jiang Song, I beg you, don't kill me.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Jiang Song, I beg you.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Let me go. Don't kill me.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
No.

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
No.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
No.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Jiang Song.

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
You want to die?

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Let her go.

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Cry.

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Hate me.

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Who said I was your creator?

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Why are you laughing?

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
My creator.

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
You must have a way to take me out of the city.

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Right?

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I made you so miserable.

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
You don't cry or make trouble.

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
How can I find a way to take you out of the city?

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Tears are useless to hurt yourself.

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Hatred is blind to the mind.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
No eternal enemy.

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Only companions of the heavenly and earthly power.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
You and I are half of the world.

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Don't compete with each other.

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Why don't we make a deal

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
before we die?

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You have nothing.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
What can you bring me?

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Have you ever thought

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
you don't need Cui Youan's armory

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
but your own weapons?

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I only need Cui Youan.

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
He has everything.

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
But that's his.

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You can only get it

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
if he gives it to you.

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Why don't you try

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
to take it all in your own hands?

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Enough.

79
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Don't try to fool me.

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
You just want to trick me

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
and replace me.

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
The role of the character in the story is selected.

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Will you make an effort

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
to change the ending and become the main character?

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Where did you get the confidence

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
that the story you designed

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
will be better than my own life?

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
You...

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
You are so arrogant.

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
You can't win me over.

91
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
You can't learn

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
how to deal with people

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
without falling down.

94
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Put down your sword

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
and come here.

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Isn't it good for you

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
to take revenge on me?

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I can't even

99
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
take the love

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
that you gave me

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
to be your pet.

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I won't take it from you.

103
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I don't need your reward.

104
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
He is afraid of your power.

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
He is a fool.

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
But using this power

107
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
is the most hateful thing.

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
What did you say?

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Zhuxu.

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Dad.

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Get up.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I'll take you away.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Are you okay?

114
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
That way.

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
You...

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Jiang Qixiao.

117
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Are you still not awake?

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
No.

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
He didn't really want to kill me.

120
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Otherwise, he wouldn't let Shijiu tell me

121
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
that it was just a joke.

122
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
You ask me what I can give you.

123
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
The first one

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
is to give you only one.

125
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Can you take it from me?

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm just giving you

127
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
a way out of the prison.

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
The way is right in front of you.

129
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
You go or not go.

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
You think

131
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
it's not a prison

132
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
when you run away?

133
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Let me tell you

134
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
what is the prison of a beautiful woman.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
It's the appearance.

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I'm not guilty.

137
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm not guilty either.

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I'm not guilty.

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
A ugly guy,

140
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
a fox,

141
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
they're all in our class.

142
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
What a coincidence.

143
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Xue Miaoli

144
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
is ordinary and guilty.

145
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Not ordinary and guilty.

146
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
What's wrong with my bedroom security?

147
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm your guardian.

148
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
You're a big girl.

149
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I have to care about you.

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
You're not obedient when you're a big girl.

151
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
You have your own opinion, right?

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Look at what you drew.

153
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Age,

154
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
age,

155
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
age,

156
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
age,

157
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
and age.

158
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
You said I was biased.

159
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Just an egg.

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
How old are you?

161
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
What's wrong with you?

162
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
What did you learn in school?

163
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
The more you learn, the more ignorant you are.

164
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Our prison

165
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
is a pair of eyes that judge us.

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
We seem to have a lot of choices.

167
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
In fact,

168
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
we have no choice at all.

169
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Then don't wait for others to make a choice

170
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
and walk out of a way by yourself.

171
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm not afraid.

172
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
How to go?

173
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Just trust me.

174
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Shen Que will come to save us.

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Little Nine.

176
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Little Nine.

177
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Little Nine.

178
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Little Nine.

179
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
It hurts.

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Little Nine.

181
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm in his hands.

182
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Run!

183
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Little Nine.

184
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Since you are not good,

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
I can only send you to the netherworld.

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
It's a pity that

187
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I haven't played enough.

188
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Be careful.

189
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Jiang Song.

190
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Shen Jun.

191
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Jiang Song.

195
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Shen Jun.

196
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Are you okay?

197
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Jiang Song.

198
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Jiang Song.

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Master.

200
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Mr. Cui.

201
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Wait.

202
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
She is the criminal who escaped from prison.

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
She will be punished tomorrow.

204
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
General Shen and I

205
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
are under the supervision of the police.

206
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Eunuch De.

207
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
My son.

208
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Premier.

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I understand.

210
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
The criminal escaped from prison.

211
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Mr. Cui saw her being pitiful and kind.

212
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
He didn't expect

213
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
she was a criminal.

214
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Yes.

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Thank you, General Shen.

216
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Mr. Cui.

217
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Miss Jiang.

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I didn't see you at home today.

219
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I didn't expect to meet you here.

220
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
What's the matter?

221
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
A few days ago,

222
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I was in the netherworld.

223
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I saw you.

224
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I saw you.

225
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I saw you.

226
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I saw you.

227
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I saw you.

228
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I saw you.

229
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I saw you.

230
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
I saw you.

231
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I saw you.

232
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I saw you.

233
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I saw you.

234
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I saw you.

235
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
I saw you.

236
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I saw you.

237
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm sorry for the trouble at the restaurant a few days ago.

238
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I can't remember it clearly.

239
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
But I must have been confused.

240
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I came to the Prime Minister's Mansion yesterday to propose a marriage proposal.

241
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm really ashamed.

242
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Isn't this what you want?

243
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I mean,

244
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
this marriage can help you get rid of your troubles.

245
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Isn't it?

246
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Yes.

247
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
But I'm so sorry for you.

248
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,600
It's not a big deal for me to marry a married woman.

249
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Are you in a bad mood today?

250
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Maybe it's the reason for the good reputation.

251
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Yes.

252
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
The world is full of good reputation.

253
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
People on the road want to break off their marriage.

254
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Each lamp is a letter to the people who have passed away.

255
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
We're lighting the lanterns for my father.

256
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Do you want to light the lanterns too?

257
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
So you won't have to worry about your own death.

258
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
No need.

259
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I'll leave you alone.

260
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Mrs. Jiang.

261
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
If a close person has passed away,

262
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
but she doesn't feel sad,

263
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
do you think this kind of person is heartless?

264
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Not really.

265
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Oh?

266
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
People's sorrow

267
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
may be as short as a storm

268
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
or as long as a storm.

269
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
But there's another kind of person

270
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
who is ignorant and unrivaled,

271
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
but at some point breaks out of the earth.

272
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
This is what makes her so amazing.

273
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
She's been growing up in the dark.

274
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Is this kind of person worth being understood?

275
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
It's worth asking yourself.

276
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Thank you.

277
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
This is the lotus soup fish cake I made.

278
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
If you don't mind,

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
please try it.

280
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Goodbye.

281
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Mrs. Jiang, you're also here to light the lanterns?

282
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Yes.

283
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
This smell.

284
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Those who don't light the lanterns are like a single light.

285
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
There are thousands of lanterns.

286
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Those who are bright are bright.

287
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Those who are bright are bright.

288
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
You're as bright as a grass,

289
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
but you're not as beautiful as a Bodhisattva.

290
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Why can't I do it?

291
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Why?

292
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
General Shen,

293
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I know that you're forced to

294
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
do this for the Cui family

295
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
because you're the daughter of the Cui family.

296
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm helpless.

297
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I won't be able to win.

298
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Thank you for your understanding.

299
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
In the official field,

300
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
there's me and you.

301
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I just hope that you can take care of me in the future.

302
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Eunuch De Ming,

303
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm sorry.

304
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Eunuch De Ming, it's time.

305
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Wake up.

306
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I was provoked by a man.

307
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
But my family didn't help me.

308
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm innocent.

309
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I was a widow for 15 years.

310
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
The county committee said that they would give me a piece of the needle and a needle.

311
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
I made him change it to food.

312
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
He blamed me for being disrespectful.

313
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Am I guilty?

314
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I'm innocent.

315
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I'm innocent.

316
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm innocent.

317
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
I'm innocent.

318
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
I'm innocent.

319
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
I'm innocent.

320
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I killed my man.

321
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
He hit me.

322
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
I beat him.

323
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm guilty.

324
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
But I don't admit it.

325
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I dressed up as a man to attend the imperial examination.

326
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I was exposed.

327
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I died of laughter.

328
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
It's not a pity.

329
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm innocent.

330
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I'm innocent.

331
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm innocent.

332
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I'm innocent.

333
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
I'm innocent.

334
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm innocent.

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm innocent.

336
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm innocent.

337
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I'm innocent.

338
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I'm innocent.

339
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm innocent.

340
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I'm innocent.

341
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm innocent.

342
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm innocent.

343
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm innocent.

344
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm innocent.

345
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I'm innocent.

346
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm innocent.

347
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I'm innocent.

348
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm innocent.

349
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I'm innocent.

350
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm innocent.

351
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm innocent.

352
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
They didn't catch up at the last minute.

353
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
fatuous

354
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
My god.

355
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Thank you.

356
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,280
seedlings now.

357
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,560
Court Lady department,

358
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,560
after the malt capability of Ninth Lord

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,480
ended,

360
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
you can come back and repeat my request.

361
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,040
Leave all of her

362
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,960
to me.

363
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,000
A'Mo.

364
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,280
Wait.

365
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,640
As a beloved servant,

366
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,640
I'd better let them

367
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,000
settle.

368
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's okay.
