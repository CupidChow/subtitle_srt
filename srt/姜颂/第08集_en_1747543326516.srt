00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At the small road in the city,

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
there is a small grass house

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
at the gate.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I have told my grandson

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that you will protect him.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Jiaojiao said that

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
you can enter the house

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
when General Shen comes.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who is it?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am Shen Que.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Do you eat lychee?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then do you eat coriander?

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Eat.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Come in.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So that old man

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is really looking for me?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, no.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Third Uncle will kill me.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He is looking at my shop

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and wants to make it a hundred-year-old shop.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hundred-year-old shop?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If I remember correctly,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you are just 18 years old this year.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So what?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The coriander lychee pancakes I invented

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
will definitely spread.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You won't stop eating, will you?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You just said

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
you eat coriander and lychee.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Someone is here.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's Jiaojiao.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Only she knows about this.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be careful.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A'Mo, escort His Highness away first.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Your Highness.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you choose me,

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we will meet at the bend tomorrow at the right time.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will wait for you until the next day.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you don't come,

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I won't eat a single bite.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Have you decided

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
where to go?

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Who sent you here?

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Speak.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Shen Que, you will die today.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are fooled.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you mean?

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Look at him.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm fooled.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Who did I fool?

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Didn't you guess?

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Who sent you to find Royal Descendant?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I will tell you the whereabouts of Royal Descendant.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Is it Lady Jiang?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Only she knows about this.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Impossible.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Cloud River

65
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,000
You can get attractive

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
whenever,

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and all days of yesterday will end like yesterday.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In the next life,

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
let's just be hang spending our lives.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't ever look back,

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and don't ever meet again.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Mr. Jiang

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,440
You come back

74
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:23,080
to see her

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,560
My Lady

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,200
I won't be late.

77
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,160
My wife said

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,080
that one's love is like the sun, moon and stars.

79
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,560
It's unreachable.

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
But I think

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,840
the stars are currently

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,440
in the illusion of rain.

83
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
When the stars fall into the dust,

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
I'd like to be in soap operas.

85
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Young Master Cui,

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,560
I thought I told you to go back first.

87
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,160
I want to stay here for a while longer.

88
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Shen Que.

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,120
What happened?

90
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,920
You failed to help your fiance to kill me.

91
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,360
Are you disappointed?

92
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,760
What are you talking about?

93
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,200
It turns out that what you said yesterday

94
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,360
was true.

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,640
What happened?

96
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,600
Why are you acting so strange?

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,680
Your cube-shaped indulgence

98
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,460
is way better than

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,400
doing whatever you want

100
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,400
without any cooking skills.

101
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm not...

102
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,880
But I will not allow yourselves folder.

103
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,720
You can't get rid of me.

104
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,160
I want to let you be in a trance

105
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,680
day and night,

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,840
and die forever without ending your life.

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,520
If you can't marry Cui You An,

108
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
I'll be with you

109
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,480
for life and death.

110
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:38,340
The

111
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,580
Miss, this is empty age

112
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,460

Sian

116
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
It's my fault.

117
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,620
She started to talk nonsense again.

118
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,020
In the beginning of the novel,

119
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,660
Cui You'an

120
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,100
hates Jiang Song.

121
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,860
Why would she...

122
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,700
Is it because of Hu Rong?

123
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,100
Hu Rong?

124
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,500
Cui...

125
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,260
What are you doing?

126
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,540
Who are you?

127
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,260
Where are you taking me?

128
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,140
Aunt Jin,

129
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,500
get prepared...

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,220
for the Elemental Cultivation Ceremony.

131
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,740
Congratulations, Madam Jiang,

132
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,260
on taking all patronage.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,580
I thank Cui You'an.

134
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,780
Thank you, Nanny Jin.

135
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,780
Please have this bowl of tea.

136
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,220
It's a bitter and bitter tea.

137
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,540
After you enter the Prime Minister's mansion,

138
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,580
you must observe the tea and salt.

139
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,740
Keep your mouth shut.

Wait.

Lastly, I want to tell you

152
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,020
You get dressed first.

153
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,020
You do as their said,

154
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,620
Eunuch성 Ji,

155
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,860
who were you?

156
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,040
How did you wear the dress

157
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,320
that looks like me

158
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,900
on top of my wedding collar?

159
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Thanks to you,

160
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,480
I end up with a more beautiful face.

161
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,320
Unfortunately,

162
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,580
it's clearly much like yours.

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,420
is similar to you.

164
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,300
Jiang Jiaojiao?

165
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,100
Jiang Song.

166
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,580
Who can be the happy girl of the Prime Minister's Mansion?

167
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,980
It's the Prime Minister who decides.

168
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,420
Prime Minister?

169
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,940
What does it mean?

170
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,980
Jiang Jiaojiao.

171
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,180
Zhao Chengze has been brought back to the palace

172
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,980
by Shen Que.

173
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,980
I was framed.

174
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,220
Besides,

175
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,660
even if the Imperial Grandson returns to the palace,

176
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,700
the one who takes the throne

177
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,060
will be destined to be the Third Prince.

178
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,060
Trust me.

179
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,300
I can predict the future and predict the past.

180
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,900
Do you think I will trust you?

181
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,060
You and His Majesty

182
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
made a promise to the Emperor of the Great Mountain

183
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,620
to serve the Emperor of the Great Zongwei Palace

184
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,860
as the Prime Minister's son-in-law thirty years ago.

185
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,180
Don't you remember?

186
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,940
No wonder he wants to protect you.

187
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,100
Who?

188
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,180
Jiang Jiaojiao.

189
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,180
You will be the one

190
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,980
who will be the happy girl tomorrow.

191
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,260
Really?

192
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,420
But why me?

193
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,380
You met the Noble Lady.

194
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,380
Noble Lady?

195
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,580
Thank you, Prime Minister Cui.

196
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,660
Who are you?

197
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,580
What a mess!

198
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,060
The leading actress of this world

199
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,660
is already here.

200
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
How do you know?

201
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,460
Who are you?

202
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
It doesn't matter.

203
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,860
What matters is

204
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,100
what you want.

205
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,300
I can help you.

206
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,460
You can help me?

207
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,620
Yes.

208
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,340
What do you want?

209
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,620
I want...

210
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,460
I want to be more beautiful.

211
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,780
I will say

212
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,980
it's all because of this scar.

213
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,700
It's all because I'm not beautiful enough.

214
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,020
Every time I look in the mirror,

215
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,500
I seem to be looking at her.

216
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,260
I hate this face.

217
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
I want to be more beautiful.

218
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,540
I want to be more beautiful than her.

219
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,660
Can you help me?

220
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,380
Of course.

221
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,780
I can even

222
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,460
change your birthmark.

223
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,620
Have you made up your mind?

224
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,740
The leading actress

225
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,860
must be the most beautiful.

226
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,540
Right?

227
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,500
What a lunatic!

228
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,260
It's all because of you.

229
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,020
If you had listened to me

230
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,100
and followed Zhang San,

231
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,180
you wouldn't have died here.

232
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,620
Died?

233
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,620
How did this happen?

234
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,980
How朋友

235
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,940
It's you.

236
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,420
Mom.

237
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,580
Mom.

238
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,980
you can't do anything without His Majesty at your side.

239
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,580
Try it.

240
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,700
Cao LuOn,

241
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:08,100
I look so

242
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,020
What did she do?

243
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,020
You're talking like I'm a victim.

244
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,740
I didn't hurt her.

245
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,340
She's the bad guy, okay?

246
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,820
Where is she?

247
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,740
Granny Jin said she'd handle it.

248
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,660
I don't know.

249
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,540
There seems to be a movement in the box over there.

250
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,260
That night must have been a moving action.

251
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,540
Would you tell me?

252
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,060
I'm afraid,

253
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,180
Jin Cheng!

254
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,820
So gentle.

255
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,100
Why won't you fall ill?

256
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,500
Good.
