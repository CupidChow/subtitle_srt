1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let me see.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's Shen Jun, Zhang Chao's adopted son.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Not long ago,

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
they only painted a city.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Be quiet.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't be serious.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here they are.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's go.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Jiang Song.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Shen Jun.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're here.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ruan Mian Hua is looking after you.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Where is he?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Where did you go?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I went to catch the thief.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Didn't he tell you?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He told me.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Were you waiting for me here?

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You care about me so much.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you want to wait,

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
don't wait outside.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's cold outside.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I told you.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't wait for you.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You didn't wait for me.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's good that you're back.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I found the antidote.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Take it.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Where did you get it?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A doctor gave it to me.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A doctor?

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's wrong with you?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Shen Jun.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you know that

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
after I take the antidote,

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll go to a place

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
very far away

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and a place without you?

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Even so,

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
do you still want me

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
to take the antidote?

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why?

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Because

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want you

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to go to the place you want to go.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want you to live for yourself.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You saved me back then

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
not because

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm a different person.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But you're good in your own way.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Although it's hard for me to walk all the way,

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have more choices than you.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now you've found your own way.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't trap you anymore.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Jiang Song.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't be afraid of anyone.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Even I can't.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not as good as you said.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm selfish.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Most of the time,

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I only care about myself.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Fish eat bugs.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
When they grow up,

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
trees need to be watered and raised.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But no one says

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
trees and fish are selfish.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They just follow the instinct of the forest.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're the same.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Jiang Song.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You actually said

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm a fish and I'm a tree.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Because you're also a tree.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Because you're also one of the spirits in the world.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've seen many fish and many trees.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But I only met one Jiang Song.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My eyes don't seem to hurt anymore.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Can't you see?

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You liar.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Shen Jun.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Does it hurt?

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I... I fell.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I often fall.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't cry.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What is this?

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Jiang Song.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You'll catch your moon.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll go.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're back.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I didn't expect we all survived.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thanks to General Shen.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I used to think General Shen was a bad guy.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I didn't expect you to take us in.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It doesn't matter.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My mother took my brother back to the countryside.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This house is empty.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
My lady.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why don't you just live with General Shen?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's so messy here.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's no reason to disturb others.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
My lady.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Look.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I found your wallet.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What's wrong?

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Listen.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What's that sound?

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's no sound.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Listen.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now there are so many people in the house.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a big problem to fill the stomach.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Left, right, up, down.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The fortune is rolling.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Good, my lady.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You just want to make the money.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Then the money won't come out empty.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's more important to fill the stomach.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right?

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's go.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Who is it?

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Three and a half jin of cucumber and cabbage.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The sesame opens the door.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Xiao Xi Xi.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're back.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're back.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm back.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm back.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're back.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm back.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm back.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm back.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm back.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm back.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm back.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm back.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm back.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm back.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Qian Qian.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Your family has been asking you to study.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They must love you very much.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why don't you go home?

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have been determined since I was a child.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I want to be like a man and support the country.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I want to wait until the day when women can also be an official in the court.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But now I can't get my family involved.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Will there be such a day?

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I will work hard for it.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The third prince Zhao Yong is the most likely to become the new emperor.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If I see him, I will tell him my feelings.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No matter what the result is,

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I will try my best.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm back.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We made ten money today.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So much?

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's great.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm so tired.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
My wife.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I heard a strange thing on the way today.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What is it?

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The real man asked the emperor to give a new princess.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Princess Changning?

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The princess in the game said that

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
she could protect the emperor's body and health.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Goddess, soldiers, fire god soldiers, one fire lotus.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Nezha?

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
My wife, you have an idea.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Embroidery and paintings are really worth it.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But it's not enough for us to spend money.

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My wife.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why do you avoid him every time General Shen comes?

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
My wife.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can you stay for the general?

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He has been so lonely these years.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You don't go to say hello again?

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why do you avoid me?

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Did I do something wrong?

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sorry, brother.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sorry, brother.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I just had a bad memory these days.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I made you hungry.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
My wife.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The money really appeared in vain.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The magic happened.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm so stupid.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Stupid?

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Where did the magic come from?

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I had a dream.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I dreamed of an 18-year-old night.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's go.

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Sir, your wine.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Please.

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
My uncle forced me to marry again.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't want to marry.

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But my mother said I was too selfish and too willful.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Is it really my fault?

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I just want to marry the man I like.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It would be great if someone could take me away.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I...

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What?

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have nothing.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You have nothing.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The man I want

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
is the great general of Wei Fang and Lingling.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He is a great hero

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to be worthy of me.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This is the moment

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that I regretted for many years.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If I had called him out

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and told him

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that it's okay even if I have nothing,

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
if I didn't be so willful

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and let go of my childish pride,

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
if I said that,

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
would everything be different?

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Shen Jun.

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This time,

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
in my dream,

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I finally said that.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm willing to go with you.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I dreamed that we watched the sunrise together.

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Counted 100,000 stars.

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Raised two children.

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
One like you,

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
one like me.

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
One like me.

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Like any couple,

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
life is bitter and sweet.

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
As time goes by,

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
we grow old.

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Shen Jun,

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I dreamed that

246
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
we lived a long life.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Shen Jun.

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I miss you so much.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm still lost in the secret and the heartache that's been left behind.

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The clouds and the sun are all in the sky.

251
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Where are you going?

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm going to see Shen Jun.

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Now?

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, now.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The next life will be a long journey.

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Shen Jun,

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
when I woke up,

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
my first thought was

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that we were lucky

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
that we were still alive.

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This time,

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
it's my turn to see you.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll go.

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Shen Jun.

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Xiaosu.

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Mrs. Jiang,

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
calm down.

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Shen Jun.

269
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Shen Jun, I'm willing to.

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Shen Jun, I came to tell you

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that I'm willing to stay for you.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Mrs. Jiang,

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
calm down.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Shen Jun.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Shen Jun.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Calm down.

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let go.

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Calm down.

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Shen Jun.

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What happened?

281
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Amu.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Amu.

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
amu

284
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,100
town

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Where's Amu?

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Go on.

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Your Highness.

288
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Lord Chen.

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There's no one inside.

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Shen Jun must have hidden them.

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
Brother,

292
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,640
Mother told me

293
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,520
the guilty must die.

294
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,840
The real one, Yu Yan,

295
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,560
has a daughter who will bring back the Yunyong Order.

296
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,200
That girl can help the late crown prince to turn the case.

297
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
If that's true,

298
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
the crown prince and the party will support Zhao Chengze.

299
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,000
The crown prince was convicted

300
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
because of me and Mother.

301
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
General told me

302
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,240
if he's in trouble,

303
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,400
he'll take you away from Jiang's.

304
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,920
Be careful.

305
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,280
Go back to Jiang's after the storm.

306
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
It's the safest way to go.

307
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Okay.

308
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
Jiang Jiaojiao.

309
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,360
No.

310
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm a storyteller.

311
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,720
How come you...

312
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,560
Don't you want to hear the story first?

313
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,280
What story?

314
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,040
I saved

315
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,960
the story of five fish.

316
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,120
Don't wait any longer.

317
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,480
Cui You'an will be here soon.

318
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,600
Come with me.

319
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,520
You believe Shen Que so much?

320
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,080
If he tells you where you are...

321
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,840
He won't.

322
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,960
He won't?

323
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
It's just love.

324
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,360
You're also in trouble for me.

325
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,920
How about

326
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,560
making a bet?

327
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,600
Will Shen Que

328
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,480
betray you?
