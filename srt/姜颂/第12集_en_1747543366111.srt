The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What are you doing?

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you serious?

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are you serious?

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What else?

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll send you off first.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't believe it.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Get off.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't...

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Unless you tell me the truth.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me go.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I won't.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sister Jiang.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you for the fish cake.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's delicious.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What fish cake?

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I mistook you for someone else.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Wait.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Who gave you the fish cake?

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a sister who looks like Madam.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Where is she?

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm late.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She is my wife.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm taking her home.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When did she become your wife?

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Shen Que.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can't protect her.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let go.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Shen Que.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Shen Que.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shen Que.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,920
It is important that she is alive

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,360
and that we can talk little to later

39
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,440
Alright

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,640
I won't do to you any harm

41
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,480
Just nutmeg that old eunuch

42
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,780
Can we do that?

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,760
Or what

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,140
I will be honest

45
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,760
I am not

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,420
Because whenever she doesn't like me,

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,920
she would yell at me that I'm useless.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,560
Are you sure

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
to send some woman to death?

50
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,360
I want to get the skincare talisman.

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,820
But you wouldn't wants to be innocent.

52
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,660
You trust me just like this.

53
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,320
Yes.

54
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,400
Too many Stupid Eagles

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,840
You were once a young man

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
under my care.

57
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,040
If you were to be the one,

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,640
what else could I trust?

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,640
Fine.

60
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,040
I won't let you be disloyal.

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,200
I want the Tiger Tally.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,080
I'll protect their lives.

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,920
Shen Que.

64
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm going to the Prime Minister's Mansion.

65
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,840
Didn't you finally get away from Cui You An?

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,000
Didn't you ask me

67
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,160
why I couldn't leave?

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,600
I also want to know.

69
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,680
So I'm going to the Prime Minister's Mansion

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,640
to find someone to answer.

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,440
I can do it for you.

72
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,920
You have your responsibilities.

73
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,120
There are millions of people who need you.

74
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,560
Moreover,

75
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,120
people

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
can only rely on themselves.

77
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,000
But you went to the Prime Minister's Mansion

78
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
just to get into the Tiger Tally.

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,960
Do you believe me?

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,640
Fine.

81
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
When you find the answer

82
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
or need help,

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,240
press here.

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,080
Did he hurt you again?

85
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,360
Stop pretending.

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,720
You must be hungry.

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,600
I asked someone to prepare it.

88
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Try it.

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,480
Cui You An.

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,880
Let's make a deal.

91
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,160
I can be good to you.

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,560
But you

93
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,960
must give Jiang Jiao Jiao to me.

94
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,400
Why do you want her?

95
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,480
I hate her.

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I want to take revenge on her.

97
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,960
I've killed her.

98
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,360
No.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Jiang Jiao Jiao won't die easily.

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,200
That's good.

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,200
It saves us a lot of trouble.

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Add more.

103
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,420
Hen is evil

104
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,320
brother of Yuan Sh men.

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
He once coveted mother's blood.

106
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,680
But this time,

107
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,400
heã€œ

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,360
Get out

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Rest well

110
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,760
We can decide what to do next

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,620
Lord

112
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,360
Are you fine?

113
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Sir, are you all right?

114
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,220
Inform him that

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,780
I'll allow Madam Jiang to marry the rightful wife in the future.

116
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,100
Sir, you can't.

117
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,660
You just allowed Madam Jiang a few days ago.

118
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,180
How can you get another rightful wife?

119
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,900
Without this rule,

120
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,820
I'll break it.

121
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,600
The previous Virgo

122
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,820
Qingwen.

123
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,140
I cooked this for you.

124
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,940
Well.

125
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,780
You think I'm on trees

126
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,900
cause you've learnt to cook this.

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,540
No.

128
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,220
You've been living in misery.

129
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,380
I meant your benefits.

130
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,980
Do you think I'm your type?

131
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
I don't know.

132
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,620
But I'm nice to you

133
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,580
because you're a good person.

134
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,780
Because you're worth it.

135
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,060
I'm a good person?

136
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,580
Yes, you are.

137
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,180
I've figured it out.

138
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,660
You've broken into many pieces

139
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,660
after Chen Niang left.

140
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,780
I want to put you together piece by piece

141
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,860
and put you together again

142
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,700
as the best Cui You An in the world.

143
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,860
What can you do for me?

144
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,980
Anything.

145
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,460
As long as I can make up for it,

146
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,180
I'll wait and see.

147
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,180
It's just a plot

148
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,780
to chase after the funeral.

149
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,180
The more I put in,

150
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,780
the more he'll regret it.

151
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Jiang Jiao Jiao,

152
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,980
how can I see you?

153
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,980
What are you doing?

154
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,180
What are you doing?

155
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,980
Let me go.

156
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,980
Let me go.

157
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,180
Let me go.

158
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,980
Don't move.

159
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,380
A girl who can't get on the stage

160
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,780
wants to enter the Prime Minister's mansion.

161
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
She needs to learn the rules first.

162
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,180
Go.

163
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
Take off her clothes.

164
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,580
Go.

165
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,380
Let me go.

166
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,180
Let me go.

167
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,580
Don't come over.

168
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,980
I'll kill whoever comes over.

169
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,980
You're pretending to be a gentleman.

170
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
I'll kill you, you bitch.

171
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,380
It hurts.

172
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,780
How dare you look at me?

173
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,580
I...

174
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,180
Stop.

175
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,180
Stop.

176
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,380
Sir.

177
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,580
Let go.

178
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
Don't touch me.

179
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
Disgusting.

180
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,980
Sir.

181
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,980
I want her to learn the rules

182
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
and serve you.

183
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,180
Sir.

184
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
Sir.

185
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,780
Hands.

186
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,780
You and her

187
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,580
will die together.

188
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Don't be afraid.

189
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,380
Bastard.

190
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,580
Let's go.

191
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Let's go.

192
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,380
Let's go.

193
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,180
You'll meet someone.

194
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
Congratulations! You finally found me

195
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
I just want one answer

196
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
Why can't I leave the city?

197
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
If you want to know, ask me

198
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,380
You forgot to hurt me, right?

199
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
What?

200
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,380
I didn't expect you to bear it

201
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
Say it

202
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
You insisted

203
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
Jiang Song

204
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,380
Everyone in this world

205
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
has all kinds of ending in the future

206
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Except you

207
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Why?

208
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Because you shouldn't have a future

209
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
What do you mean?

210
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,380
Your eyes, nose, and mouth

211
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
are all my ending

212
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,380
It's all my masterpiece

213
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
I created you

214
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
You were born in a snowy day

215
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Your father died in a foreign country when you were 13

216
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Shen Que met you in the dark at 18

217
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,380
Every moment of your life

218
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
is just a few lines in my novel

219
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,380
And you are just an ancient woman who has never lived

220
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,380
You mean

221
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,380
this world

222
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380
is just a novel you wrote?

223
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,380
I died in an accident

224
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
and then spring came to my novel

225
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
You died?

226
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Yes, an accident

227
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
I've already reminded you

228
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,380
that you should have died in the fire

229
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
I was the one who survived for you

230
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,380
and changed your life

231
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
So you died in your world

232
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
to steal my life?

233
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,380
How can you say that?

234
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,380
Without me, how can you live?

235
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,380
You couldn't escape

236
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,380
because I had never written your story outside the city

237
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,380
And you

238
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,380
The world outside has never existed

239
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,380
You mean

240
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
my past is fake

241
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,380
and the future I want

242
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
doesn't exist at all

243
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,380
Yes

244
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,380
You are a person who has no past, present and future

245
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,380
But I

246
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
I almost succeeded

247
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
Just a little bit

248
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
You lied to me

249
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,380
I didn't lie to you

250
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Anyone can escape from the city

251
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
Only you can't

252
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,380
Because

253
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,380
I had already written your story

254
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,380
before you were born

255
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
That's good

256
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,380
Even if you kill me

257
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
you can't escape

258
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,380
But I'm a living person

259
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,380
The blood and tears I've shed

260
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
How can they be fake?

261
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
There must be a way

262
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,380
There must be a way

263
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,380
There must be a way, right?

264
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
No matter how much I have to pay

265
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
I'm willing to do it

266
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
Even if there's only a little hope

267
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
There's no hope, Jiang Su

268
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
There won't be

269
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
I don't believe it

270
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
I don't believe it

271
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,380
Poison me

272
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
You can admit your fate, Jiang Su

273
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
I poisoned him as you told me

274
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,380
As long as you like

275
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,380
I can help you keep him

276
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Well done

277
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,380
You're so good

278
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,380
You've been like this for hours

279
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,380
You didn't even blink

280
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
You didn't even eat

281
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,380
Forget it, let's go

282
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,380
Every moment of your life

283
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
is a moment of change

284
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
It's just a few lines in my novel

285
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,380
You're a person who didn't have the past

286
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,380
but now and the future

287
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
My wife is now the young madam of the Prime Minister's Mansion

288
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
According to the rules

289
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,380
she should give you a wedding dress

290
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,380
Look how beautiful this wedding dress is

291
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
I forgot

292
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
You're going blind

293
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
My wife, come on

294
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
Let me go

295
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
Let me show you

296
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Let me go

297
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
All this is just a game for me

298
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,380
I want to take back what I gave you little by little

299
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,380
This is the fun of this game

300
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,380
Master, Jiang Su is outside the door

301
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
He said he wanted to ask for your help

302
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,380
He's finally here

303
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,380
Then I'll let him in now

304
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
No hurry

305
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,380
Let him wait

306
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
Master, Jiang Su is here

307
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,380
He's waiting for you

308
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
Come on, let's go

309
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Mr. Cui

310
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Do you still keep your words?

311
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
As long as I beg you

312
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
you'll agree to anything

313
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Then it depends on whether you're really obedient

314
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
I only ask for one thing

315
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
Say it

316
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
Kill Jiang Jiaojiao

317
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
Very good

318
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
This is the look of a person who hates

319
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
and hates the world

320
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
I'm not afraid of you

321
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,380
I'm not afraid of you

322
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,380
I'm not afraid of you

323
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
I'm not afraid of you

324
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
I'm not afraid of you

325
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
I'm not afraid of you

326
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm not afraid of you

327
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
I'm not afraid of you

328
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
I'm not afraid of you

329
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
I'm not afraid of you

330
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
I'm not afraid of you

331
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,380
I'm not afraid of you

332
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
I'm not afraid of you

333
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
I'm not afraid of you

334
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
I'm not afraid of you

335
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
I'm not afraid of you

336
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,380
I'm not afraid of you

337
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
I'm not afraid of you

338
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
I'm not afraid of you

339
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,380
I'm not afraid of you

340
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,380
I'm not afraid of you

341
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
I'm not afraid of you

342
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
I'm not afraid of you

343
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
I'm not afraid of you

344
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,380
I'm not afraid of you

345
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
I'm not afraid of you

346
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,380
I'm not afraid of you

347
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
I'm not afraid of you

348
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,380
I'm not afraid of you

349
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm not afraid of you

350
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,380
I'm not afraid of you

351
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,380
I'm not afraid of you

352
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
I'm not afraid of you

353
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
I'm not afraid of you

354
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,380
I'm not afraid of you

355
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
I'm not afraid of you

356
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,380
I'm not afraid of you

357
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
I'm not afraid of you

358
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
I'm not afraid of you

359
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm not afraid of you

360
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
I'm not afraid of you

361
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
I'm not afraid of you

362
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm not afraid of you

363
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
I'm not afraid of you

364
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
