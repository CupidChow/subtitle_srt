00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Twenty pairs of clothes?

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why are you standing here?

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that you're not here to give my wife a wedding gift.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Your wife's wedding gift?

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You've stolen too many things.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Have you forgotten who is the most shameless?

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You...

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
May I ask who is Madam Jiang?

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Secretary Xue.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Secretary Xue.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You must be here to find my wife.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
May I ask Madam Jiang to come down?

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I...

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Madam Jiang.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This ointment is very good for the IQ.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You should try it.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Mr. Cui said that

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the lotus soup fish cake I made was very similar to your old craft.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So I made some.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You don't like it?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I like it very much.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Did you get your hands dirty?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
By the way,

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I bought a hairpin on the way here.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It suits you very well.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How about you put it on for me?

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Thank you.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Thank you.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I once asked you in the temple.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want to ask you again.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Marry me.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Aren't you concerned?

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,600
I'll just take a walk.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,320
But the gentleman's will should not be used.

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,440
Don't you mind our beginning?

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,440
My lady.

60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,920
Young Master.

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,280
Young Master, can you

62
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,400
let me hide for a while?

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,160
Zhang San, Zhang San.

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
The medicine hasn't come up yet.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
What's the hurry?

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Why don't you let it run away?

67
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,360
I'm just afraid that it won't.

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,320
Hurry up.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,160
Hurry up and chase it.

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,960
My lady.

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,560
Are you okay?

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,360
My lady.

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,920
Are you okay?

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,440
I'm fine.

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Thank you, Young Master.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,040
Who is the one who chased my lady?

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,000
It's...

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,480
It's my uncle.

79
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
He gave me the medicine

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
and forced me

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,240
to sell it to someone else.

82
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
How dare he?

83
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,720
The emperor is so powerful that he's forcing the people to marry him.

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
Do they not respect the law?

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,240
Young Master, you must be from a noble family.

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,760
No wonder you don't know

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
the so-called law

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
is to protect the people

89
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,440
and the power.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Are you not feeling well?

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
I'll get you some handkerchief.

92
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Thank you.

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,120
I will never give up.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,400
This person must have a bad background.

95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,280
I dare not offend him.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,680
I'd rather not lose

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
than be beaten by him.

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,080
Isn't Rong Jinxiu

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,200
the emissary of the 에!

100
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,360
Is he being fulfilled

101
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,240
Hotpot.

102
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,760
The two of you don't have clear hands.

103
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,520
The Shouldn't Have pretended So High.

104
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,480
Indeed, the should have done so.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm the one who's to blame.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You don't need to be sorry.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Master.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Get out.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Even if you don't care about the starting point,

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
am I the one you want to reach the end?

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I...

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I...

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I...

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I...

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I...

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I...

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't like Jiang Jiaojiao.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But hatred is hatred.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Gratitude is gratitude.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I hope you can find the one you love.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you like her?

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm ashamed to say this.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've been a slow-witted girl since I was young.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know how it feels to like someone.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Liking someone is like her once taking care of you.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In the future, the stars are her.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The moon is her.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The sun is also her.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But the sun, the moon, and the stars are all unreachable.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So they should be high in the sky.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why can't I trust the person who dragged me back to the immortal world again?

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Tell me the answer.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not the one who is tied to the mud.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mr. Cui,

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
there are two days left.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I hope you can think about who you want to spend the rest of your life with.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay?

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Mrs. Jiang.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you choose me,

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
see you tomorrow at the sunset.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Cui Youan.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Cui Youan.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You've come to my house.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why didn't you come to see me?

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why didn't you take care of your wound?

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You care about me, right?

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I...

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Cui Youan, look at me.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Look at me.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Cui Youan.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Cui Youan.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Look at me.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Mrs. Jiang.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Although you are a man of your word,

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you will tolerate me if I make trouble.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You will worry about me if I get hurt.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will make you confused.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You like me.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So you don't like him, right?

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Will an unloved marriage be happy?

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I have something important to do.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll see you another day.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can't go.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Love is free.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Marriage is free.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Can you be bolder

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and be braver?

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What's wrong with you?

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm waiting for you until the sunset tomorrow.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If you don't come,

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I won't eat anything.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My lady.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
My lady, why are you bleeding?

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My lady, why are you bleeding?

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My lady.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
My lady.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
My lady.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If there was no such thing as the capital,

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
maybe you would marry General Shen.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't have to be like this.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Qiqi.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There are thousands of choices in life.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But you will find that

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
there is only one way to go.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So don't look back.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Shen Que and I

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
have already taken the wrong path.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There are two ways.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why can't you look back

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
if you took the wrong path?

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Who allowed you to come in?

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Get out.

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is my room.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm getting married.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You broke in.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You still have the face to refuse?

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Qiqi.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Help me drive her away.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Me?

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you don't go, I will.

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let go.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let go, Shen Que.

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What do you want?

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why must you marry her?

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you still want to ask?

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
To be beautiful and rich.

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You are not like this.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You won't betray yourself.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
General Shen.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What kind of person am I?

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you know how much I can sell?

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Let me tell you.

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Go west to Cai's City.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Go.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are a rich man.

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Your brother is a rich man.

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I am your uncle.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Who can say no to you if I sell you?

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A woman can only sell five or six taels of silver.

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
A woman can only sell five or six taels of silver.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Madam.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You are with Zhang San.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can earn a hundred taels of silver.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
As long as the price is appropriate.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What can't I sell?

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
A woman's marriage has its own master.

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's up to you.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You sold a lot of silver.

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You are contented, right?

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do you know as a woman,

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it's already a great fortune to choose to be sold to someone?

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have been scolded too many times in my life.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Being a mother,

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
a concubine,

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
a mother.

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I can finally be myself.

245
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
In theory,

246
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you also sell your father's life for your father-in-law.

247
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You can make a living.

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You can earn some fame and fortune.

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I sell my life for the peace of the world.

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
For the stability of the world.

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No matter where you are,

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you don't have to worry about it.

253
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Whether you believe it or not,

254
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
these years,

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I have been climbing mountains and rivers.

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I have been living in the world.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have been living in the world.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
These years,

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have been climbing mountains and rivers.

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Not for the sake of the emperor.

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But for the sake of the world.

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I want to hear you say it.

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I want to hear you say it.

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
General Shen.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You look down on me.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You look down on yourself.

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because of you, I...

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It was because I was too stupid.

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I couldn't even take care of myself.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I even went to care about others.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
General Shen.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You go to the high places.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You are in the sun and the moon.

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You are admired by the world.

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And tomorrow,

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you will be born in the mud.

277
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I...

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yesterday is like yesterday.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
In this life,

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
we are the same.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't look back.

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't meet.

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't get your Qingyun Road dirty.

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And please,

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
don't come to disturb my wealth.

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If you insist on marrying him,

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
fine.

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
When I find my grandson

289
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and get the tiger talisman,

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I will return to the border.

291
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The border.

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Nine lives.

293
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
At least,

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
he can accompany you forever.

295
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Jiang Song.

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Happy wedding.

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
These years,

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I have been saving it.

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I was thinking...

300
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Forget it.

301
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It doesn't matter.

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I hope you can protect yourself

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and the people you care about

304
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
in the future.

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If I don't die,

306
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will come to see you again.

307
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The End

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Shen Que.

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't tell me about the funeral.

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Live on.

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I know you want military power,

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to protect the mountain and to stabilize the peace.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If I can help you,

314
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I will tell you where my grandson is.

315
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
How do you know?

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You don't need to care about it.

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I just hope

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the tragic events in the capital city

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
will not happen again.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I believe you can do it.

321
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't let go of the momentary tenderness

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and the pain in my heart.

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm searching for the secret

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and the heartache that can't be stopped.

325
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The eyes and the dreams

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
are all empty.

327
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The dog

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
stole a coin from him.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He's doing all these for this dog.

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just a coin.

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's so noisy.

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's so miserable.

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He's in trouble.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's go.

335
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's a little hot.

336
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Why don't you go home and wait?

337
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You go to the cold place to rest.

338
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll keep an eye on him.

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Look at me.

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What's wrong?

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So happy.

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Of course.

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
With money,

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I won't suffer from hunger

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and I can be bullied.

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Money can protect me

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and...

348
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the person I care about.

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,640
The tenderness of the heart turns into the pain in the heart

350
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,840
I look for the secret and rush to the heart that can't be caught

351
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Hugging and hugging are empty

352
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Losing you is useless even if I try to look for you again

353
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,240
It turns out that life is not as deep as love

354
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,440
Where's my hairpin?

355
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,120
So ugly

356
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,640
Losing you is useless even if I try to look for you again

357
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,640
It turns out that life is not as deep as love
