LEVEL 4

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,100
Honey,

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,660
clothes can't make a man and woman fit.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,440
It's wrong.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,160
It really is.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,240
You proposed to me earlier on the premises.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,720
Have you no taste at all?

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,000
Enough of the immunology.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,080
Don't you have a plan for us too?

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,960
She has goneวย

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,720
over to Zhang San who got married.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,440
She went startups to make perhaps Shan Auswiswine.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,080
Her family have fallen headlong,

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
but she can't equip Heron Island

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,520
and take advantage to make Itsu by her own.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,760
You're lucky to have a wife.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,800
Thank you.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,040
I've been unole from hall with one thousand schoolls.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,360
Welcome.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,360
Lady, may I know your name?

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,120
My husband is identified with beautiful beauty.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm sure he's kind to you.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,760
Any day you need to propose to me.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,280
My name is Jiang Song.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
is like a cloud in the sky.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,240
Look at this cloud.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,280
This line

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,880
is specially explained by Cui Xue.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,960
The bride must be the best.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,400
Is it the most expensive one?

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,840
Of course.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,800
That's enough.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,360
Don't be angry if you want to go.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,600
Zhang San is so fond of her.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,920
But she took Cui Xue's photo.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,920
Does she deserve it?

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,920
You men can choose between three or four.

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,600
Why can't I choose a good husband

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,240
and a good family?

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm sorry, father.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,080
My family will be ruined after my father's death.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
If I didn't take care of the family,

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,600
would you concentrate on studying?

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,200
I don't dare to be humble and climb up.

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,040
Am I wrong?

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,880
It's my responsibility to be the only one.

48
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
I will be upright.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
Not like you.

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,720
If I can get into the market,

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,520
why should I use my body to climb the high door?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,480
Don't you men rely on others to climb up?

53
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,560
It depends on the father and the woman.

54
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,480
Don't blame me.

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,960
Mind your own business.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,480
You...

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,440
Yao Zu.

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Where are you going?

59
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,000
Madam.

60
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,600
Yao Zu.

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,560
My lady.

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't listen to Lang.

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,880
You still have a long life ahead of you.

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll go and call her back.

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
Why are you in the way?

66
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,720
I should go first.

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm leaving.

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,440
You got it

77
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,560
Everyone are drenched

What?

83
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,260
I need a spring

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,180
Please, Jiaojiao.

85
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,220
Please save my daughter.

86
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:55,720
This is the retribution for the

87
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Jiaojiao.

88
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Jiaojiao.

89
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Jiaojiao.

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,880
Jiaojiao.

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,880
Jiaojiao.

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
Jiaojiao.

94
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
Jiaojiao.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,840
Jiaojiao.

96
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm here to pick you up.

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Father.

98
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,000
When Ren Bin died,

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,720
I really saw my family.

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,200
Come with me.

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,080
No one will pick you up.

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
Jiaojiao, be good.

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,120
I'll take you to buy some candied fruit.

104
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,240
Just like when we were kids.

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
Jiao Jiaozi.

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Mr. Cui.

107
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,000
My brother-in-law.

108
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,320
It's dangerous.

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Mr. Xia Fu, something is going to happen.

110
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,840
Let's go.

111
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,040
Don't make me worry.

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,840
Don't go.

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,800
What are you talking about?

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Jiao Jiaozi.

115
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Jiao Jiaozi.

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Jiaojiao, be good.

117
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Jiaojiao.

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,800
Jiaojiao.

119
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
Jiao Jiaozi.

120
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
You made me weak.

121
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,440
It's a curse to be Jiaojiao.

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,600
I hate you.

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Don't you remember, father?

124
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,040
Come with me.

125
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,920
You're not my father.

126
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,400
You're an illusion.

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,280
The king of death and the king of the dead.

128
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,480
Jiao Jiaozi.

129
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,760
Jiao Jiaozi.

130
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,800
Jiao Jiaozi.

131
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,440
Jiao Jiaozi.

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
Mr. Cui.

133
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,520
My lady.

134
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
My lady.

135
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Jiao Jiaozi.

136
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,120
Jiao Jiaozi.

137
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,920
Mother.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,120
Are you okay?

139
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Mother, I'm fine.

140
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,200
You're making me worried.

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,480
Mother.

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,080
Let's go home.

143
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,480
Jiao Jiaozi.

144
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,480
Mr. Cui went to save you.

145
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,760
He hasn't come out yet.

146
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,480
Mr. Cui.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Cui Youan.

148
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,000
Jiao Jiaozi is waiting for you.

149
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,520
Jiao Jiaozi.

150
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,800
Why?

151
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,720
Why are there two A'ji?

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,000
Who are you?

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,840
Who are you?

154
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,320
They both fainted after they came back.

155
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,840
What is the other one?

156
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,080
Jiao Jiaozi.

157
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Jiao Jiaozi.

158
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Jiao Jiaozi.

159
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Jiao Jiaozi.

160
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,440
Jiao Jiaozi.

161
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Jiao Jiaozi.

162
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Jiao Jiaozi.

163
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Jiao Jiaozi.

164
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,240
I dare not go in.

165
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,080
Two A'ji.

166
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,840
It's so scary.

167
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
Could it be a monster?

168
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,440
Shut up.

169
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
Find out the cause of the fire.

170
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,760
Don't let more people know about tonight.

171
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,560
Especially the Prime Minister's family.

172
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,760
Yes.

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,240
Master.

174
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
The Third Prince is waiting for you.

175
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,080
What should we do now?

176
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,160
Take care, Mr. Cui.

177
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,080
Mother.

178
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
We should find out who is the real A'ji.

179
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,600
The wedding will be held in seven days.

180
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,640
If the rumors spread,

181
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,280
the wedding will be ruined.

182
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,080
Even I, Ke Ju, will be affected.

183
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
You always blame your sister

184
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,880
for the bad luck of the wedding.

185
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,600
Now you want fame and benefits.

186
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
You should learn to be smart

187
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
and be nice to your sister.

188
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
Our family even point out your sister's marriage.

189
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,560
Mother.

190
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,440
Jiao Jiaozi.

191
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,520
Mother.

192
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,600
It hurts.

193
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
Mother.

194
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,720
It hurts.

195
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,840
Okay.

196
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,520
Mother.

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,160
Mother.

198
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,040
How is it?

199
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,880
Did you find out?

200
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I asked a few things

201
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
that only your sister knew.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,640
They both can answer.

203
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Mother.

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,080
Jiaojiao wants to drink your sweet soup.

205
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,680
I'll go and cook it for you.

206
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
Go. Go.

207
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,400
Hello, Jiang Song.

208
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Nice to meet you.

209
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,520
This is the wedding gift.

210
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,000
Isn't this my mother's hairpin?

211
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes.

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
Mother gave it to me

213
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
to coax me.

214
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,040
Here.

215
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,080
You've always liked this, right?

216
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
Who are you?

217
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,600
I won't tell you

218
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,600
who I am.

219
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm afraid I'll scare you.

220
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,520
But you can call me Jiaojiao.

221
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,840
You don't like this name anyway.

222
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,480
From now on,

223
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,560
you're Jiang Song.

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,240
I'm Jiang Jiaojiao.

225
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
I didn't expect

226
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,000
you could survive.

227
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,240
Don't worry.

228
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,280
I'll help you to start a new life.

229
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,560
You set the fire.

230
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,080
Not me.

231
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm not as clumsy as you.

232
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Who else is it?

233
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,560
It's Tianqian, okay?

234
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
What's wrong with me?

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,360
You're so weak and strong.

236
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,600
Isn't it enough to use the kindness of Cui Youan

237
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,080
to make people angry?

238
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Don't worry.

239
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,600
I'll help you find a good home.

240
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
From now on,

241
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,760
you should be a good person.

242
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,640
Jiaojiao.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
Zhang San.

244
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Why are you here?

245
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,200
You asked me to come in from the back door.

246
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,440
And I took you away.

247
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
It's him.

248
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,120
He wants to drive me out of the Jiang family.

249
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,440
Jiaojiao.

250
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,560
Let's run away.

251
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,320
I let you run away

252
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
without asking you to.

253
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
What do I want?

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,520
To open a porridge shop with you?

255
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Jiaojiao.

256
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
My father paid the debt for your family.

257
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,480
We signed the engagement.

258
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,920
Uncle made the engagement.

259
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,960
It's none of my business.

260
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,080
Besides,

261
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,440
I have to pay the debt.

262
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,800
If you don't come with me,

263
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,520
I'll die here today.

264
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,280
No.

265
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,760
Don't let your blood

266
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,960
dirty my new dress.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,800
You came to deliver the wedding dress in person.

268
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,800
It's too troublesome.

269
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,360
I brought it here today.

270
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,280
Jiaojiao will come here soon.

271
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
I'll keep the wedding dress.

272
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
Please wait a moment.

273
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,240
Thank you, Madam.

274
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,120
Tu Youan.

275
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,360
You're not Madam Jiang?

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
I am.

277
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,040
But I'm not the Jiang Song who planned you.

278
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,760
I'm the Jiang Jiaojiao

279
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,000
sent by the Immortal to give you happiness.

280
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,800
Immortal?

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,520
You don't understand.

282
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,480
Anyway, as long as you know

283
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm destined to marry you.

284
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,320
You

285
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
will love me.

286
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,480
But I'm engaged to Madam Jiang.

287
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,880
It's none of my business.

288
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,880
Look.

289
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,520
We look the same anyway.

290
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,000
Just choose me.

291
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,840
Are you really going to marry a person

292
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,120
who planned you for the so-called responsibility?

293
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,640
Your grandmother asked you to give this jade pendant

294
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
to a good girl.

295
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,000
Jiang Song is her match.

296
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,720
You're not her match.

297
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,400
Jiang Song is her match.

298
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,680
You know that?

299
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Because I'm sent by the Immortal.

300
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,320
You're a coward.

301
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,000
Why do you look down on me?

302
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,400
Why?

303
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,880
Why are you laughing?

304
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm not laughing.

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,280
Do you want me to cry

306
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,760
and beg for mercy?

307
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,680
Don't dream.

308
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,960
Don't shake your hands

309
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,160
when you're with the weak.

310
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
You're useless.

311
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,160
Shut up.

312
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,680
Shut up!

313
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,040
Uncle.

314
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,360
Let me help you.

315
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
It's my wedding dress.

316
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,600
Yes.

317
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,960
It's so beautiful.

318
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,360
It's the perfect red color.

319
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,480
It's perfect.

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let me see, uncle.

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
It's beautiful.

322
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,640
This is a good person.

323
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
This is a good person.

324
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,520
Mom, I'm getting married.

325
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,520
Mom.

326
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,080
You're so thoughtful.

327
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,000
Honey.

328
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,920
Why are you hurt?

329
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,840
I'm getting married.

330
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm getting married.

331
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,480
Qi.

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,120
Go tell her.

333
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,000
What?

334
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,120
What are you seeing?

335
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,160
The Envoy of Chang'an.

336
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,360
Merely.

337
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,520
Good- earning swine.

338
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,760
Go see her.

339
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,440
Sister.

340
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,880
Sister?

341
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's go.

342
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Qi calm down.

343
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,840
Come on.

344
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,720
At eight o'clock.

345
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
I'll bring you to buy some food.

346
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
Don't be a bad person.

347
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,840
Okay?

348
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,080
Go.

349
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I'm a noble.

350
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,720
If Cui You'an wasn't a gentleman, how could you have succeeded?

351
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,360
You shouldn't have forced yourself. You should have repented.

352
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,560
Yes.

353
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
That's why I chose...

354
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,760
Miss Xia.

355
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,560
You're not right.

356
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,840
The Buddha won't stand on your side.

357
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,960
You should have died in a big fire.

358
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,080
I'll live for you and change my life.

359
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,680
But why should you live for me?

360
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Because you'll only become a woman with a yellow face.

361
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,280
Without thoughts and soul, you'll only be a man.

362
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,000
But I'm different.

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,640
In my original life,

364
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,360
I learned nothing in my life.

365
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,160
My thoughts are the most outstanding men of this era.

366
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,560
I can be equal to them.

367
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,480
The difference between us is the red hook of this new world.

368
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,680
It's not your fault.

369
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,320
It's the era that created a woman like you.

370
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,240
You have too many flaws.

371
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
It's not worth it to have a beautiful girl.

372
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,680
But I'm different. I'm perfect.

373
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,680
Why are you laughing?

374
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,160
Good thing.

375
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,960
Good thing about what?

376
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Good thing I'm alive.

377
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,880
Or else, my story would be completely up to you.

378
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,800
Everyone would say you're a bad girl.

379
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,920
But I'm the one who can decide who I am.

380
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,160
If I want to happen, no one can say anything.

381
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,000
The natural disaster won't work.

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,720
The human disaster won't work either.

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,240
You... you killed her.

384
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,160
What a pity.

385
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,240
You still made my new dress dirty.

386
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:20,320
Lady, do you really think I'm a good, stupid woman?

387
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,280
I got the money.

388
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,480
The Buddha told me not to ask for more money.

389
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,360
But I've never had more money in my life.

390
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,480
Regret.

391
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
Why should I regret?

392
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
What did I do wrong?

393
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,520
I want to kill this dirty woman.

394
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,400
And be that hooligan, Ling Xiaohua.

395
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,560
Lady Xiang.

396
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,680
Look, she comes here every month to pray for the world.

397
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,480
She's such a good girl.

398
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
Why should I give her to you?

399
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,480
whoever asks for it,

400
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,240
I will Story need it,

401
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
especially for me.

402
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,280
My path of mocking at this love is empty

403
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,160
Without you, no one can harvest the fruit.

404
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,980
So to battle with 위한 is myself not needed.
