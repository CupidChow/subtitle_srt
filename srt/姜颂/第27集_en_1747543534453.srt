1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,100
lighten the dream

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,260
Try to understand

4
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,820
The fence step

5
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,020
Episode 28

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:24,720
and Immortal Lama's

7
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,240
gift to you.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm waiting for your news and reply

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,560
Mother

10
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,080
These are my new poems

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,920
Let me have a look

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Ok

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,600
My daughter can write at the age of three

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,200
Do you think it's time to go to their street?

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come, I'll reward you with ice cream.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You wrote it so well.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Jiang Jiang.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Father.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm Jiang Jiang Jiang.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My husband adores me.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We've been together for three years.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Father.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sister, eat.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you, brother.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The Yang family adores me too.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Wherever I go, it's the focus of everyone.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The only thing missing is

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
whether I can hear the heartbeat

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
coming from nowhere.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's familiar and unfamiliar.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's very close and far.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's wrong, Jiang Jiang?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm afraid that I can't hear you.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm afraid that I can't hear you.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm afraid that I can't hear you.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm afraid that I can't hear you.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm afraid that I can't hear you.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's okay.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's okay.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I won't listen to it.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm very happy to spend my life with you.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm very happy to spend my life with you.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's noisy.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I must see

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,200
Where did that heart beat come from?

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where is this place?

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a bit familiar.

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This place is delicious too.

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm going to eat it.

52
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm going to eat it.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm going to eat it.

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm going to eat it.

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm going to eat it.

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're here.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Who are you?

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It doesn't matter who we are.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What matters is who you are.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm going to eat it.

62
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Will you catch your moon?

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Who is talking?

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tuled

65
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,920
Do you remember who you are?

66
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,880
Who am I?

67
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,920
I am Jiang Jiaojiao.

68
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,880
No.

69
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Who are you?

70
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
I am...

71
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,080
I am...

72
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,880
I am...

73
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
I am...

74
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I am...

75
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,280
I am...

76
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Jiang Song.

77
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Jiang Song.

78
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,160
My name is Jiang Song.

79
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,480
Jiang...

80
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,680
Song.

81
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,040
I am Jiang Song.

82
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,960
A butterfly...

83
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,440
I am back!

84
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,360
drums beat.

85
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,920
Customers right-h clouds.

86
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,000
Look,

87
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
do you see

88
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
or your daughter?

89
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Both of us, look?

90
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
You need to return to my world.

91
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:02,720
Why are you way too close

92
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,320
to me?

93
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
Your butterfly is broken,

94
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,000
Fairy Sister.

95
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,840
Both of you!

96
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,100
Jiu Song!

97
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,280
What is happening?

98
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,960
Could it be just a simple dream

99
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,480
of the earlier incident?

100
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,640
You're the one who did this.

101
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
You're the one who did this.

102
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,440
You did this.

103
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Jiaojiao.

104
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,960
Father?

105
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,080
You're not my father.

106
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm not Jiang Jiaojiao.

107
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm the god who created this world.

108
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm also a common father.

109
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Let me tell you a story.

110
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,560
I had a happy family.

111
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,520
I had two children.

112
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,040
Jiaojiao was a good girl.

113
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,400
She was obedient.

114
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,440
But later,

115
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,760
she met a bad friend.

116
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,960
A little thing in life

117
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,080
can make her lose her mind.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
But she didn't say anything.

119
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,960
She even started to complain that

120
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
her mother and I love her brother

121
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
and don't love her.

122
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,400
Jiaojiao.

123
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,120
Jiaojiao, where are you going?

124
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
Finally,

125
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,760
this child

126
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,840
has a very poor ability to bear.

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,800
I love her.

128
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
I want to protect her.

129
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,680
So,

130
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,000
I followed Jiaojiao's hobby

131
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,560
and created this virtual world

132
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,920
to spread her consciousness.

133
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,840
I let Jiaojiao

134
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,360
become the heroine in her own book

135
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,000
and enjoy happiness.

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
In order to make everything happen,

137
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,600
I had to follow the development of the novel.

138
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,040
I let the running bride become a real person.

139
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,760
Let her take care of this world for me.

140
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
But I didn't expect that

141
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,680
you forced Jiaojiao to escape from the city.

142
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,360
At first, I wanted to lure you into the real world

143
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,560
and let you become the container of Jiaojiao's consciousness.

144
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,800
But you are too self-conscious.

145
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Why do you insist on doing this?

146
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,640
You,

147
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,240
the real person,

148
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
and Jiang Jiaojiao

149
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,400
all told me that I was fake.

150
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,040
This world is fake.

151
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
You think I'm a cheater

152
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,840
and see me struggling.

153
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,000
But,

154
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,800
how do you know that you and Jiang Jiaojiao

155
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,520
are not cheaters?

156
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
Who can tell

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
that my world is fake

158
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,200
and your world is real?

159
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,640
You?

160
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
But your world

161
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,080
represents the real world?

162
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,360
There is no absolute real world.

163
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,840
What I live in now is the real world.

164
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,320
I live in it

165
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,240
as long as I live.

166
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,160
Nonsense.

167
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
This is the barrier that I built for Jiaojiao.

168
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,800
You are the one who is in the way.

169
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,080
You are just moving yourself.

170
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,000
Have you ever asked Jiang Jiaojiao

171
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,520
what she wants?

172
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
What do you know?

173
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,800
I am her father and her daughter.

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,600
Jiaojiao is still young.

175
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
She doesn't know what she wants.

176
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm protecting her.

177
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Your so-called protection

178
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,920
is controlling,

179
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,920
suppressing,

180
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,960
and taming.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,840
I finally know why Jiang Jiaojiao

182
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
is like this.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
She is so pitiful.

184
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,920
Shut up.

185
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,240
Who are you?

186
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,520
How dare you question me?

187
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,880
I have run out of patience.

188
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,240
I'd rather destroy this virtual world

189
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,400
than kill you, a fake.

190
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,680
Call the doctor.

191
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
The patient seems to be dying.

192
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,240
I can't do it.

193
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
