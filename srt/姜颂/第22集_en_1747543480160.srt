Episode 16

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Untamed

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Jia Suo!

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What are you doing here again?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What is this?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Open it and take a look.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Untamed

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you mean?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
As your enemy, you saved my life.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your attitude doesn't seem to thank me.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Leave me alone.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How did you get this wound?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I told you to leave me alone.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The rain stopped.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll beat you.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I've given him the money.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Shuang, I'm the first son of Duke Zheng.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I'm your brother.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why did you hit me?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Xiao Zi, let's go somewhere else.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't bear to leave you.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Untamed

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
God of B, I'm incompetent.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I failed to keep the world under control.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll make the leading actress return to her seat as soon as possible.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Please help me to convince the untamed.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Untamed

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The Untamed

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How many days are left?

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How can I not be afraid?

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But if I'm scared of the untamed,

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll be like an ant, lost and lost.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Isn't that just like the God of B's wish?

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The Untamed

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you playing?

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come with me.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Be careful.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The Untamed

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I've used up all my patience.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Kill me.

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
God of B, I won't tell you where my brother is.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Father!

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Father!

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
God of B, why didn't you let go of a child?

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Father!

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Father, please help me!

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Father!

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Father!

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's you.

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Father!

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you have any tricks, then come at me!

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Father, save my father!

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You...

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
are...

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No, father!

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll tell you!

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Father!

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I really don't know who's behind the Night Star Pavilion.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I know

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
where my brother might be hiding.

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Take her away.

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No!

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Father!

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Come.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
General, what's wrong?

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mother, I'm a little tired.

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You weren't blamed.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You wanted to find the Night Star Pavilion

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to save more people.

75
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I don't know.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
General, you've never been like this.

77
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,000
How can you be more comfortable?

78
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
Here you are.

79
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,120
This is the clothes we sewed ourselves.

80
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Take it back.

81
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Thank you.

82
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
Here you are.

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,520
This is yours.

84
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,320
Thank you.

85
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,760
Here you are.

86
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,640
Your loyal friend is so busy.

87
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,680
Don't talk nonsense.

88
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
You think you can hide it well.

89
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,320
But you can tell from his eyes

90
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
that he's a man.

91
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
Go find the Shentong Dragon.

92
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,320
I'm curious about the woman

93
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,920
you like.

94
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Tell me what she likes.

95
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,560
Thank you.

96
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
Thank you.

97
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,840
Here you are.

98
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,120
It's my turn.

99
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,400
She likes money.

100
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
You're lying, aren't you?

101
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,840
Thank you.

102
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,040
Here you are.

103
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,640
My wife is so kind.

104
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,280
Here you are.

105
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
She likes light drinks.

106
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
Not the old drinks.

107
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,840
She likes dried tangerines.

108
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
Not pears.

109
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Why is it light drinks, not old drinks?

110
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
My wife,

111
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,160
you never drink old drinks, do you?

112
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,200
Who said that?

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Old drinks with tea and pearls.

114
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,240
Isn't it the fruit-flavored pearl milk tea?

115
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,600
My wife,

116
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,440
what is pearl milk tea?

117
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,600
Pearl...

118
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,760
Can we eat it?

119
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,560
Yes.

120
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,960
What is pearl milk tea?

121
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,360
I think I've heard of it somewhere.

122
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
It seems to be said by Jiang Jiaojiao.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,480
Qiqi, help me.

124
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,320
Here you are.

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,920
Jiangиж呢.

126
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,560
Jiangiang.

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,920
My wife, Jiang.

128
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Jiang Jiaojiao.

129
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,080
Jiang Jiaojiao.

130
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,320
Jiang Jiaojiao.

131
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Please.

132
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Please.

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Please.

134
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Little lady.

135
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Little lady.

136
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
What's your name?

137
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I'll send you home.

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
I'll...

139
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll...

140
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I'll protect you.

141
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Xiaosong.

142
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Shen Que.

143
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Xiaosong, what's wrong with you?

144
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Mr. Cui.

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Mrs. Jiang.

146
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Long time no see.

147
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
That's weird.

148
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Shouldn't I let her go?

149
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Yes.

150
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Long time no see.

151
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
When did you come back to the capital?

152
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
A few days ago.

153
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Mrs. Jiang

154
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
is meeting with General Shen?

155
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
No.

156
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
No.

157
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
If that's the case,

158
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
it's late.

159
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
How about I send Mrs. Jiang home?

160
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
No.

161
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
No need.

162
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
No.

163
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Okay.

164
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
What's wrong with me?

165
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
You're not welcome to visit.

167
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Please.

168
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
General,

169
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
there's a trap.

170
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I'll go check it out.

171
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Guests are here.

172
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Who's Shen Tu Long?

173
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Take them all.

174
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
It's a trap.

175
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Go after them.

176
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Master.

177
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Thanks to your illusion,

178
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm satisfied.

179
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Seven days later is the Lantern Festival.

180
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
You're being watched by Shen Que.

181
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
If you ruin His Majesty's plan,

182
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
can you afford it?

183
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I deserve to die.

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
But I must prove

185
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
that I know nothing.

186
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Fine.

187
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
You've worked hard.

188
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Take the money

189
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
to compete with Feng Teng.

190
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Yes.

191
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Be careful.

192
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Are you okay?

193
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm here to be your wife.

194
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
But please

195
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
spare me

196
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
and protect me.

197
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Who's your master?

198
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Where are the other Night Guests?

199
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
I've never seen His Majesty.

200
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Night Guests

201
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
are going to the capital

202
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
to kill Yue Yi.

203
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,320
It's a conspiracy.

204
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
My Lady.

205
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
What's wrong?

206
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Sister.

207
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Sister.

208
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I...

209
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I've been

210
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
not feeling good lately.

211
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
What's wrong?

212
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
I feel like

213
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I need to tell you

214
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
something.

215
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I know

216
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
that you're worried

217
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,320
I feel that I can't control myself these days.

218
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
I become less and less like myself.

219
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,000
It seems that another soul is occupying my body.

220
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
Don't be afraid, my dear.

221
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,000
Maybe you are too busy recently.

222
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,200
How about this?

223
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,800
I'll go to the yard with you to have a look at the moon.

224
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,160
You like the moon the most, don't you?

225
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,840
The moon?

226
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,480
The moon?

227
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Look at the moon?

228
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,880
I'll go with you to see the moon.

229
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm going out.

230
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,680
Where are you going, my dear?

231
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,280
I'll go with you to see the moon.

232
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
Who is the one who promised to see the moon with me?

233
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,320
Why can't I remember his face?

234
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,680
It's you.

235
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,800
Why are you here?

236
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
I'm here to accompany you to see the moon.

237
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,000
The one who promised to see the moon with me

238
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,960
is you.

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
Shen spin...

240
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,120
Shen min.

241
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
You protect her.

242
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,560
I didn't...

243
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,560
No.

244
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Isn't thunder requirement

245
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,800
right in front of your eyes?

246
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,120
Father?

247
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
Did XingOLing

248
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,880
deal with him now?

249
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,400
What are we going to do?

250
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,640
Wasn't there something he wanted to do?

251
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,160
Tell me,

252
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
don't let Ning State

253
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
take his own life.

254
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,160
Someone

255
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,080
put the sticker on his wrist

256
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
It's not you.

257
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,080
The God said that if I come,

258
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,680
he will be mine.

259
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,480
It seems that he is just like that.

260
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,880
Don't worry.

261
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,080
I will let him and Shen Que

262
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,280
break the forbidden circle.

263
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,880
Besides, don't worry about the brothers of the deep-dome.

264
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,480
I won't let Shen Que find out about the Prime Minister's mansion.

265
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,680
The God sent you to help me secretly

266
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,280
to gather the night-hunt guests scattered around.

267
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,080
What for?

268
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,080
The God ordered me to help you achieve your great cause.

269
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,880
What God?

270
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,680
You are just trying to make fun of the late emperor.

271
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,480
Why don't you be more honest?

272
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
After all, the Prime Minister's mansion is now being heavily guarded by Shen Que.

273
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,680
You can take advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of it.

274
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,280
What do you want?

275
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,480
To build a peace-making relationship?

276
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,280
After the matter is done, the real person will retreat.

277
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Without the Cloud Courier Order, no one can move the night-hunt guests.

278
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Don't worry. The real person

279
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,680
can find the Cloud Courier Order.
