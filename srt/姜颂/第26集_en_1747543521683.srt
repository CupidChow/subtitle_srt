00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How dare you kidnap me?

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,000
Your Majesty,

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,120
there are many people in the palace.

6
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
I can only trouble you to this point.

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,520
Please write a letter of resignation

8
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,360
to the Empress Dowager's youngest son,

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,840
Prince Qi.

10
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,360
Prince Qi?

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,920
He's only nine years old.

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,560
He's a good puppet.

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,800
Your Majesty,

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
please forgive me.

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Your Majesty, I don't want to die.

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,600
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
every time a incense is lit,

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,120
you'll kill a common man.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
How dare you!

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Hurry up.

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,120
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Please forgive me.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,520
I'm still in the capital.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,120
How dare they rebel?

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
Go to the East Camp with me.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Take the troops of Li Dacheng to the palace to protect them.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Your Majesty,

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,320
Zhang Chao.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
We're going to rebel today.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,520
We've fought with the people who didn't have the iron.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Yes, we did.

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,920
Who said we were going to rebel?

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
The rebels were fighting against your banner.

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,520
Shen Que, under your command,

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,720
you killed so many people.

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,920
Isn't it just for today?

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Yes, yes.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Yes, yes.

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,920
We're going to rebel.

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Yes, yes.

43
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,720
You're so stupid.

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
Get out of here.

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
I don't want to talk to you.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Dear brothers,

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,320
we, the people of Zhao,

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
are going to take the throne today.

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Get out of the way.

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
You kill.

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
You kill.

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
So many people

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,320
are killed by you.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,720
It's not like us.

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
Yes, yes.

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Kill us.

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
Kill us.

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Kill us.

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Kill us.

60
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
You kill.

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Kill us.

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
You kill.

63
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Kill us.

64
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Kill us.

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Kill us.

66
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Kill us.

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Kill us.

68
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Move.

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
This...

70
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
General.

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
General.

72
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
What's going on?

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
It seems that the one who rebelled

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
is really not General Zhang.

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
But he is violent and honest.

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
He killed so many people.

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
He deserves to be punished

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
for his good deeds.

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
Yes.

80
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
He did so many bad things.

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
He only did one good thing

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
and he can be forgiven.

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
But you said he...

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Yi Feng.

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Yi Feng.

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
I didn't expect that

87
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,720
I didn't die on the battlefield

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
but on the land

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,720
that I protected.

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Yi Feng.

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Xue.

92
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
If it weren't for you

93
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
all these years,

94
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I would have killed more people.

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Thank you.

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
I was wrong.

97
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
I shouldn't have been soft-hearted.

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Xue.

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Remember.

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
People are people.

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
They are not.

102
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
As long as you

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
keep your original intention,

104
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I will not be a war cry

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
and be in hell.

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
But you...

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
You don't understand.

108
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
You don't understand.

109
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Yi Feng.

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Zheng Cheng.

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Yi Feng.

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Yi Feng.

113
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Yi Feng.

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Your Majesty, save me.

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Don't kill me.

116
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Yi Feng.

117
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Please leave.

118
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
General, you can't.

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Get lost.

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
General, you never kill civilians.

121
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
You won't regret it.

122
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
You never kill civilians.

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Get out of my sight.

124
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
General,

125
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
please leave.

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
General,

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
please leave.

128
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
General,

129
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
please leave.

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
General.

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
General.

132
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
General.

133
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
General.

134
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
General.

135
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
General.

136
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
You won't regret it.

137
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,240
Shen Juan.

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
Remember.

139
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
No matter what happens in the future,

140
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,680
even if everyone leaves you,

141
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,960
and betrays you,

142
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
don't forget who you are.

143
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
Fairy Sister.

144
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,520
Okay?

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,920
Fairy Sister.

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,960
It's her.

147
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,440
It's forashing against G24.

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
It's roomy!

149
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,560
Yes, combustible fire.

150
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Come on...

151
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,120
It's mate!

152
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,200
Grenade it...

153
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,000
So, Jiang Su was the mastermind.

154
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,280
Doctor Li,

155
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,120
if you want to report the country,

156
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,440
go to the Eastern Camp and find Li Dacheng.

157
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,000
Go to the palace to save him.

158
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,600
Okay.

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,560
Okay.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,040
Add息!

161
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
I have come to save you.

162
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,360
Your Majesty.

163
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,320
Your Majesty.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,680
Add息.

165
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,800
Dead.

166
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,320
Dead.

167
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,600
What's this?

168
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,840
This is the imperial token

169
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,120
taken by the late crown prince

170
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,920
when he was investigating the night-time class.

171
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,560
The imperial token?

172
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,200
That's great.

173
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,080
When the imperial token was issued,

174
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
the other night-time class

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,440
would be here soon.

176
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,240
You'an, give it to me.

177
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,200
Jiang Jiaojiao.

178
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,920
I'm not Jiang Jiaojiao.

179
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm not Jiang Jiaojiao.

180
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm not Jiang Jiaojiao.

181
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Jiang Jiaojiao.

182
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm

183
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
Jiang Song.

184
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,200
You.

185
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,080
You.

186
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
Your Majesty.

187
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,760
Your Majesty, please don't give in.

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,520
Shen Qun will come to save us.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,500
Negative darling.

190
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,480
Meeting is horrible.

191
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,840
We've not had any chance to exceed."

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,560
Wait.

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,280
Your Majesty.

194
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,760
Your set DAMN AUTO PT A guns are slow to be put out.

195
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,160
Move.

196
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,960
Your Majesty, no!

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,740
One, two, three.

198
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,880
Okay.

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:22,140
I've

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,960
It's expected.

201
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,440
You were cautious.

202
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,960
Now go to themetal circle.

203
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,360
Hurry, go.

Steady.

206
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,480
In my side.

207
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,680
You're safe now.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,960
Jiang Jiaojiao is the heroine.

209
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,560
Your battle gift.

210
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,240
No one can hurt you except yourself.

211
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,080
So she tried to kill you several times.

212
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,440
You survived.

213
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,800
Isn't it amazing?

214
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,960
Shen Que.

215
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,320
You're no longer the imperial edict.

216
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Why are you fighting against me?

217
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Let me remind you.

218
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,040
Trdevily as ever.

219
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,120
When you were created by my Master,

220
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,840
you were loved,

221
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,920
and had everything.

222
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,720
Do you have any pity?

223
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
So in your words,

224
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,080
my life comes from a awkward situation have a plot.

225
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,440
You can put it as

226
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,400
your legend.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Is it important?

228
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Why?

229
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,160
Actually, there's no reason.

230
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,600
My place is empty.

231
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,080
It's getting more and more empty.

232
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,320
I can't fill it no matter what.

233
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,160
What did I do wrong?

234
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,400
Why does God treat me like this?

235
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,360
You didn't do anything wrong.

236
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,560
It's all destiny.

237
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,440
No.

238
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
There must be a reason.

239
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,520
There must be a reason.

240
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,600
There's really no reason.

241
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,640
What about the cicada mother?

242
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,000
Why does she have to die?

243
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Cicada mother?

244
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,040
Which cicada mother?

245
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,960
My biological mother.

246
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,400
That woman is nothing.

247
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,200
She must have added some color to your childhood memories.

248
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,920
So she died for me.

249
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,920
For this silicon?

250
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,960
Why my daughter did this?

251
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,560
Is it something you really want?

252
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,680
Are you referring to me?

253
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,920
Calm down,0

254
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,620
The sick are not

255
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,580
really your friends.

256
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,700
What do you mean?

257
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,040
She's almost jeuש

258
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,200
Your master has surrendered.

259
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,200
You still don't admit defeat?

260
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm not.

261
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,840
Shen Qian.

262
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,880
Jiang Su.

263
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,080
How can you miss

264
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,880
the wonderful scene of his death?

265
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,040
Look at how pitiful he is.

266
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,680
Why don't you send him away?

267
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,960
Nothing to worry about.

268
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,280
Don't cry.

269
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,000
Your butterfly has dysmptics.

270
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,240
Fairy Sister.

271
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,480
Don't turn around.

272
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,080
Forget me.

273
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,840
You, could be Harper?

274
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,600
You aren't.

275
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
Look at the scene of hypothyn nhất.

276
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,840
You...

277
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,320
You'en!

278
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,040
Don't be anxious.

279
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,280
You really can't kill me.

280
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,440
You're so amazing.

281
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,920
I once taught two people how to be sincere.

282
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,520
You died for me.

283
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,160
But you...

284
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,520
want me to die.

285
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,520
You forced me to the extreme.

286
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,240
Is this your sincerity?

287
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,360
No.

288
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,400
This is my sincerity.

289
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,800
Look.

290
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm not afraid anymore.

291
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,160
I learned to love people.

292
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm no longer a monster.

293
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm not a monster.

294
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,880
Kill!

295
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm here to save Lei Chi.

296
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,520
After I die,

297
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,400
please put up a lantern for me.

298
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,600
Okay?

299
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,800
Be careful.

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
You...

301
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,360
Are you alright?

302
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
It has nothing to do with this.

303
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,160
