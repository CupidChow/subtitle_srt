00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,700
's

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,280
run

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,380
.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Behind the unboxing,

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,020
the

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,800
England

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,380
ings

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,400
So I didn't think

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,600
that

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,080
I would

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,680
have known

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,080
until now

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,600
and

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,960
Not me.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
It's your brother.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,040
Why do you want to know?

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,920
Because I can make up for the past.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,240
How is that possible?

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
How is that impossible?

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,160
Two of your sisters have appeared.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,400
What else is impossible?

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
I also know

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,720
the test for the Spring Festival Exam next year.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,600
You went to gamble

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
just to get money

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,880
to buy the Spring Festival Exam?

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,000
You know that?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,760
I told him that

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
it was just to protect myself.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,560
How did I know that he let me go

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,200
and sold you to get married?

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,680
It's none of my business.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm not like you.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,960
I have a bottom line.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,320
What are you doing?

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,840
Yao Zu.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
Yao Zu.

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,360
He wants to sell me to get married.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
It's Yao Zu's fault.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,480
But you're his sister.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,160
He has always loved you since he was a child.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,240
He will change

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
if you teach him more.

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
Jiang Su.

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
Okay.

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll teach him.

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,560
Yao Zu.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
What are you doing?

49
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
I'm not doing anything.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm just trying to help you.

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,240
I'm not doing anything.

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm just trying to help you.

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm not doing anything.

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,480
What are you doing?

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Someone reported that he tried to bribe the examiners.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
We'll arrest him.

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,520
I didn't.

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,880
You're wronged.

59
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,120
My son is an educated man.

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
How could he do such a thing?

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,120
Cut the crap.

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,720
Arrest him.

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,440
Yes.

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,920
No.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
What are you doing?

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,960
No.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,640
My son.

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,320
Mom.

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,000
Mom.

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,520
Yao Zu.

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,320
Help me.

72
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Mom.

73
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,000
You're the one who arrested him.

74
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,200
Jiang Jiu.

75
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,760
Go and tell them

76
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,720
that Yao Zu is wronged.

77
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,440
Go.

78
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Mom.

79
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040
I'm wronged too.

80
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,200
Yao Zu.

81
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,680
Don't be afraid.

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
The whole family

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,480
will get you out.

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,160
Yao Zu.

85
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
My son.

86
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,160
Don't be afraid.

87
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
Don't be afraid.

88
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,080
My son.

89
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,680
Mom.

90
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,040
Don't touch me.

91
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
Yao Zu.

92
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Yao Zu!

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,360
The mortal is still an immortal.

94
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm fine.

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Only my son can't forget.

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,040
Your Majesty's sons

97
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,760
are all great.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
They are the best in the country.

99
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
What do you know?

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,480
Shen Que.

101
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,600
Your adoptive father sent you to find me.

103
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,400
You An.

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,800
Your father has been the chancellor many times.

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,280
He wants to make you the crown prince.

107
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,360
Your father

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,600
is for the country and the people.

109
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,520
But I have something to do.

110
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
I can't think of anything else.

111
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm willing to share your worries.

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,280
Okay, Zhun.

113
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,280
Your Majesty.

114
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

115
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,440
The crown prince has a long life.

116
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,000
How long have you been single?

117
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm worried for

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm not the one who came to pick you up.

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,680
Very good.

120
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
Three, two, one.

121
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,680
Wait.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm hungry.

123
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,800
You dare to play tricks on me?

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
Do you believe that I'll kill you?

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,760
I was the one who was hungry before.

126
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,800
No matter how hard life is, it won't be short for you.

127
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,400
You should have some self-respect.

128
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,360
Is it my fault that we're married?

129
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
Do you think I'm not a big shot?

130
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,480
You're hiding at home every day.

131
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
Don't you know that the people outside are talking nonsense?

132
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,480
Which sister is not a big shot?

133
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,640
You're not a big shot.

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,840
You're not a big shot.

135
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
You're not a big shot.

136
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
You're not a big shot.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,880
You're not a big shot.

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
You're not a big shot.

139
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,600
Which sister is not a big shot?

140
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
You're too selfish.

141
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,880
General Chen.

142
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
What are you doing here?

143
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,720
Why are you running away?

144
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,000
We meet again.

145
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,720
I still like the way you dressed last night.

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,360
Greetings, General.

147
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,840
That's your brother.

148
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Guards.

149
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,160
Drag him down.

150
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,800
Yes.

151
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,960
Yes.

152
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
General,

153
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
did you see it?

154
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
I don't know what you mean.

155
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I was blocking the arrow for you last night.

156
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
A man would die for a woman.

157
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
I was touched.

158
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
If this woman is indifferent,

159
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
how can she be honest?

160
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
You're right.

161
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Yes.

162
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,880
I should take good care of your love for me.

163
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
The one that unites you.

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
The one that unites you

165
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
is you.

166
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Director Kang,

167
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
you're Witeng Ringmaster.

168
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Finger~~~

169
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
I'll strike according to command.

170
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Hunian,

171
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,960
I'll accept if it's out of context.

172
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,880
Your Majesty has explicit instructions on this matter.

173
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,460
I don't understand what you mean,

174
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,300
please give me your comments.

175
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,280
If he tells me anything, I'll kill your brother.

176
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Speak.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
I don't want to.

178
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,480
Please go ahead.

179
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,000
If I might zip out your谢谢,

180
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
then enough.

181
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,000
Hurry up.

182
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm long ago into a many- będziemy inches-long book.

183
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,240
That is me.

184
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,840
I went through the fire

185
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,160
and was saved by the ancient goddess.

186
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,160
I married the man she ordered

187
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,080
and fell in love with her.

188
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,600
The life of the Nixi is perfect.

189
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Except that

190
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,320
the ancient goddess is not dead now.

191
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,760
Will this change the plot?

192
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,480
The next plot should be

193
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Cui You'an sent a invitation to Jiang Jiaojiao.

194
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,320
The Prime Minister's banquet.

195
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,640
Where is my invitation?

196
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,560
Mr. Cui.

197
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
Why are you here?

198
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,040
I heard that your brother was in prison.

199
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,680
Do you need help?

200
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,280
No need.

201
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,280
I should let him suffer.

202
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,560
By the way,

203
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
my aunt will come to my father's birthday banquet tomorrow.

204
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,760
She said she wanted to see you.

205
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,080
I...

206
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,280
My lady,

207
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,080
that is the Empress.

208
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
This is the invitation.

209
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

210
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,760
My lady will come.

211
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
My lady will come.

212
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,880
My lady,

213
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,680
we should dress up well

214
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
when we go to the Prime Minister's mansion.

215
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,040
This one.

216
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,400
A little butterfly

217
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,680
flies over the Banyin Bridge.

218
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
Little butterfly

219
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,360
flies...

220
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,360
Here.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Here.

222
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,840
I've been crazy for so many years.

223
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,640
I feel so pitiful.

224
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,120
It's okay.

225
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,800
I have my wife and you are always by my side.

226
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,720
Eat slowly.

227
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,960
There is more.

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
koorakor infantry

229
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,740
Tongidula

230
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,580
Angry child!

231
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,400
Here you are.

232
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,600
Yes, hit it.

233
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,880
You are so easy to deal with.

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,340
Jiang Song

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,120
really sent the red rain-baker

236
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,260
in my behalf.

237
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,220
I should be the heroine.

238
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
Come on.

239
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Yao Zu.

240
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,220
Yao Zu is the only child of my family.

241
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
Mother.

242
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,220
How can I let Lian Zu and Lian Zu down?

243
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
It's all over.

244
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,220
It's all over.

245
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
He hurt you so much.

246
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,180
It's all because of my mother.

247
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Mother.

248
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
It's not a game.

249
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
If you lose, you will die.

250
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
What should I do?

251
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,180
He is so cruel to his own brother.

252
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
He can't stay at all.

253
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,180
He will be in a mess if he doesn't stop.

254
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,180
I can't be soft-hearted anymore.

255
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,180
Come on.

256
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Come on.

257
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Second Young Master.

258
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
Yes.

259
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
Come on.

260
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
This is really a beautiful girl.

261
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Right?

262
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,180
She is a beautiful girl.

263
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
Master.

264
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Mr. Li and Mr. Wang are here.

265
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
Congratulations.

266
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Please come in.

267
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Congratulations.

268
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Come on.

269
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
Please come in.

270
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Come on.

271
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
Come on.

272
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Congratulations.

273
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Mr. Li.

274
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Congratulations.

275
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Please come in.

276
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,180
Please.

277
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Please.

278
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,180
His Majesty is getting worse.

279
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
At this critical moment,

280
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,180
he wants to find the future of the Crown Prince.

281
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,180
He doesn't want to make another crown prince, right?

282
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Don't worry, Your Highness.

283
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,180
The third prince succeeded the throne.

284
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,180
It's the destiny.

285
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
Cui You'an.

286
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Cui You'an.

287
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,140
A businesswoman.

288
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
She is a bitch.

289
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
She even dresses up as a noble woman.

290
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
She is so rude.

291
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
She can only make a few people look good.

292
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
According to the plot,

293
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
if I can get the experience,

294
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,140
I can make Cui You'an fall in love with me.

295
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Why are you here?

296
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
Where is Mrs. Jiang?

297
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
She can't come.

298
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I'll come for her.

299
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
No one can replace her.

300
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
No one can replace me.

301
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
You'an.

302
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
That's the woman you mentioned.

303
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Let me see her.

304
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Aunt, she...

305
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Cui You'an.

306
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Do you want Her Majesty

307
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
to know that there are two strange things about Jiang Jiaojiao?

308
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
I've been a Buddhist since I was a child.

309
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
I'm afraid that she will become a nun.

310
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I'm relieved to see you.

311
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,100
By the way,

312
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
what birthday gift did you bring?

313
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Show us.

314
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
You didn't bring anything, did you?

315
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Don't make it difficult for me.

316
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
I've never seen such a rare treasure.

317
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
You're right.

318
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
But you should know some etiquette.

319
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
It's important to be polite and kind.

320
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
Your Highness,

321
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
I'm afraid that my etiquette

322
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
will be unnoticeable to you.

323
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
OK.

324
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
Bring it on.

325
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Let me go.

326
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
Mrs. Jiang.

327
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
Since you know it,

328
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
you can't go.

329
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
Let me go.

330
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Let me go.

331
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
Don't scream.

332
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
Let me go.

333
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,060
Why are you so stubborn?

334
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Let me go.

335
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Let me go.

336
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
Let me go.

337
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
Be good.

338
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,060
Let me go.

339
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Mother.

340
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
Mother.

341
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,060
I told you not to scream.

342
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Don't meddle in my business.

343
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Or I'll kill you.

344
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
Mother.

345
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
Get out of here.

346
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
Mother.

347
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Mother.

348
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Will you cry if I die?

349
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Will you regret running away because of fear?

350
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
I understand.

351
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,020
I need you to protect my child.

352
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,020
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
I'm sorry.

368
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,020
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
I'm sorry.

376
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
I'm sorry.
