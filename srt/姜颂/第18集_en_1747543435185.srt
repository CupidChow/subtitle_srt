1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We孩코

2
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
We are for the Chosun.

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Episode 15

4
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,080
My Qianqian.

5
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,440
My Qianqian.

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,840
Mrs. Yang.

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,320
Mrs. Yang, please rest in peace.

8
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,640
Master, they're here.

9
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,040
Forget it.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Where's Mrs. Yang?

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,840
Let's go.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
Excuse me.

13
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,040
Mrs. Yang.

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,040
Mrs. Yang.

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,520
Mrs. Yang.

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,240
Mrs. Yang.

17
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,880
My...

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,760
Mrs. Yang.

19
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,440
My Qianqian

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,720
is here to see you.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,480
Shen Xue.

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,520
Why?

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,400
Why did you do that?

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,560
General, how did you...

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,440
Mrs. Jiang, why are you here?

26
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,560
General Shen.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Why did you kill Qianqian's family?

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,880
They're all good people.

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,600
Why did you kill them?

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
You shouldn't have appeared here.

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,560
Why did you kill them?

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,960
Why did you kill them?

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,040
They should be punished

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,960
for their mistakes.

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
Yao's Mansion

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,000
has so many people

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
and they're all guilty?

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,840
Yes.

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,880
Fine.

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Even so,

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,320
why didn't you give the trial to the government?

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,960
Why did you kill them in the middle of the night?

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
It's the order from the army.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,840
We must kill them as soon as possible.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,280
They're not the rebels.

46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,840
They're just...

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,960
They're just

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,720
living people.

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,600
Shen Xue.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,280
Mother.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Take them back.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,680
Mrs. Jiang.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Let's go.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,960
if we killuelle Grandma

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
is she going to forget

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
where she came from?

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,040
Shut up!

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:00,720
Let her Xifeng

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,840
go to the lab later.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Don't get mad.

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,920
Let's go.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,760
Dad.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,560
Mrs. Jiang.

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,480
What do you want?

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
Put it here.

66
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,120
He fell in front of his father

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,440
and was struck by Shen Que's sword.

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,840
The smell of blood in the air

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
made Shen Que miss his childhood.

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,840
After he was not saved,

71
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,800
Shen Que was once again under the command of his adoptive father.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,560
General, there is no more living.

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,160
Next.

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,680
Shen Que only loved his adoptive father.

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,920
When the court said they were guilty,

76
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,800
they should die.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
In order to kill more people,

78
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,760
Shen Que killed more people

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,680
to help his adoptive father.

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,200
Jiao Song.

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,720
Didn't I ask Amo to send you back?

82
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,880
Shen Que.

83
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,480
If Qianqian is still alive,

84
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,880
will you

85
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
kill her too?

86
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
This is a secret order from the army.

87
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,800
I can't tell you.

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,880
Secret order from the army?

89
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,520
Is it your adoptive father's order?

90
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,040
Shen Que.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,960
Come with me.

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,040
Okay?

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,920
Where?

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,800
Far away from the capital.

95
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Far away from your adoptive father.

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Far away from everything.

97
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
I'll be with you.

98
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,640
I want to

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,160
but I can't.

100
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,360
Why?

101
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,280
I have something to do.

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Something to do?

103
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,560
What is it that you have to do?

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
Kill people?

105
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,640
Kill the innocent?

106
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,280
I don't like you.

107
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,800
Don't do it anymore, okay?

108
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
Kill people?

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,480
Do you think I want to do it?

110
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,920
Do you think I have a choice?

111
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
Kill the innocent?

112
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Then I'll tell you what I want.

113
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,560
I want to make a contribution.

114
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
Of course I have to kill countless corpses.

115
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Do you think I can

116
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,960
go to this point?

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
You want to know how many people I killed, right?

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,400
Don't say it.

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,760
Don't say it.

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,880
I don't want to hear it.

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
I don't care if you want to hear it or not.

122
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,000
This is me.

123
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
This is what I've done.

124
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,120
Wait for me.

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,040
Godfather.

126
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,560
Have you dealt with the Yao family?

127
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,480
Yes.

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,800
Yao Xiaozhi was the witness.

129
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,280
She said the Crown Prince raised Ye Xingke.

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,280
The Crown Prince was killed by the Empress Dowager.

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,480
She deserves to be rewarded.

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,200
Godfather.

133
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,120
Yao Xiaozhi was honest before her death.

134
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,280
These years, she has raised the Ye Xingke

135
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,880
in the name of her family.

136
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
It's a pity that she didn't live.

137
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,680
After the Crown Prince died,

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,480
Ye Xingke's track was gone overnight.

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,040
Now it seems that

140
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,600
she was hidden by the Empress Dowager.

141
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,440
I will continue to search for her.

142
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,480
By the way,

143
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,160
the girl named Jiang Song

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
doesn't suit you.

145
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,280
She...

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,160
She is the most important person to me.

147
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
I said she doesn't suit you.

148
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,200
You know that, don't you?

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,120
You saved a few sinners.

150
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
You think you are a good person?

151
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,600
A person like you and me

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
is a murderer.

153
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,600
You can't hide her.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,120
If she knows what you did,

155
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,040
she will leave you.

156
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,320
Think about it.

157
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,440
Yao Xiaozhi.

158
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,520
It seems she won't return.

159
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,160
Jiang急 female.

160
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,800
You are here.

161
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,760
How are you feeling?

162
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,880
Are you leaving with me?

163
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,760
I want to ask you the same thing.

164
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,440
You wrote Shen Que as the role,

165
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
how is he?

166
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,480
He used to fight with his adoptive father.

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,480
He will be more and more brutal

168
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,280
towards his adoptive father.

169
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,040
But you wrote that Cui You An is a gentleman.

170
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,240
It doesn't fit.

171
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,680
But his experience is similar to the novel.

172
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,840
Think about it.

173
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
The death of the mother-in-law

174
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
will make Shen Que

175
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,640
kill the village again.

176
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Be careful!

177
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Jiang Jiao Jiao.

178
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Jiang Jiao Jiao.

179
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,200
I saved you out.

180
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
But you want to escape.

181
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
Actually, you don't have to go.

182
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
As long as you kill Jiang Su,

183
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
you will be the leading actress.

184
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,200
You are a psycho.

185
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,120
I won't be the leading actress, okay?

186
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,680
Then you can't be the leading actress.

187
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,160
Go!

188
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
Come back!

189
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Really come back!

190
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,680
You came back!

191
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,280
Pause.

192
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I'm back.

193
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Jiang Jiaojiao?

194
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
I jumped from up there.

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,960
When I woke up, I saw a door.

196
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,960
The door was still glowing.

197
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
You jumped from such a high place?

198
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,640
But didn't you say you were dead?

199
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,640
I also find it strange.

200
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Maybe it's because I'm not dead.

201
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
Maybe the system protected me.

202
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Let's go home.

203
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,600
I miss crayfish.

204
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,720
Look at the thing in the sky.

205
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,960
Does it look like an eye?

206
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Jiang Song.

207
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,280
Jiang Song, where are you?

208
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Jiaojiao.

209
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Jiaojiao.

210
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,320
Jiaojiao, you're back.

211
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Let's continue playing games.

212
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,120
Look at all the scabies on her face.

213
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,920
Isn't she suffering from infectious diseases?

214
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,680
Shut up.

215
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
I guess so.

216
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
She's not well.

217
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I think so.

218
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
I think so.

219
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I think so.

220
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Look at her.

221
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
She's not clean.

222
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
I wonder how many viruses are on her.

223
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Let's stay away from her.

224
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,520
Don't get infected.

225
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,280
That's right.

226
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Let's go.

227
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Jiaojiao.

228
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Jiaojiao.

229
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
What's going on?

230
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,240
This is not the real world.

231
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Run.

232
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Run.

233
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Run.

234
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
It's gone.

235
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
It's all gone.

236
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,280
Are you all right, my dear?

237
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
May I ask,

238
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,880
what day is it?

239
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
It's the New Year.

240
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,680
It's been half a year

241
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,080
since we last met.

242
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
It's getting dark.

243
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,880
Father is going to kill someone.

244
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,280
Let's go home.

245
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Come on.

246
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Let's go.

247
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Let's go.

248
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Come on.

249
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
It's not safe in the city.

250
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
You should go home.

251
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Let's go.

252
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Since you left,

253
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
life has been getting harder.

254
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Dongmei went up the mountain to pick herbs and sell money.

255
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
He misused the spiritual wisdom of the son of Duke Zhen's son.

256
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
He was caught in prison.

257
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
The son of Duke Zhen's son?

258
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Jiao Qin's dead.

259
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
He's a stubborn son.

260
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
He insisted that we pay three thousand taels

261
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
to release Dongmei.

262
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
We don't have that much money.

263
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
The life is really hard.

264
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Xiu Xiu

265
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
went home.

266
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Xiu Xiu went home?

267
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Xiu Xiu went home?

268
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
But Xiu Xiu

269
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
was killed by her family.

270
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Yes.

271
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
But she still has food to eat when she goes back.

272
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
She's alive.

273
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Sometimes

274
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
she's even worse than a dog.

275
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I'll go get a doctor.

276
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
No.

277
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I'm fine.

278
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
We don't have money to treat Rui Xue.

279
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
If Miao Hua didn't come from the dead,

280
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
we would have starved to death.

281
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Miao Hua?

282
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Miao Hua

283
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
is still alive?

284
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
She's alive.

285
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Miao Hua

286
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
is alive.

287
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Shen Que

288
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
How is he?

289
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
General Shen

290
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Let's eat.

291
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm here.

292
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm not busy.

293
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm very worried.

294
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,280
Holy emperor looks very much to general Shen.

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,040
General passed on the rules.

296
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,440
And established Dark Asleep Guard.

297
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,400
Shen Que

298
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,520
killed more and more people

299
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,400
to get rid of his adoptive father.

300
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,200
He is the biggest traitor in the book.

301
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,880
He and his adoptive father

302
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
have been running the city together.

303
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,600
From now on, he will

304
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,720
kill his adoptive father

305
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
more and more.

306
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,360
By the way,

307
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
there is a woman

308
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,360
in the Night Guard

309
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,200
named Qin Shuang.

310
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,080
She is the sister of that evil Qin Sizhe.

311
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,240
But she is a very powerful female general.

312
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,640
It is said

313
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
that she and General Shen

314
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,000
have been friends for many years.

315
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,960
Last month, they were...

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,880
They were engaged

317
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,080
with General Shen.

318
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,080
My lady,

319
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,840
General Shen must think

320
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,040
that you are never coming back.

321
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,560
Go to him.

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,480
He will change his mind.

323
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Since Shen Que

324
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
has decided to marry him,

325
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,840
he must have thought it over.

326
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,520
Get out of here.

327
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,000
You owe me money.

328
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
Or I will burn this house.

329
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,240
What do you want?

330
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,000
There is a new face.

331
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,080
Let go.

332
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
You owe me money.

333
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,960
It is the law of the world.

334
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,240
Since you don't have money,

335
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
I have to arrest you

336
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,600
and pay you with my body.

337
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Do you still have the law?

338
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,520
Now, Shen Que

339
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
is in charge of the city.

340
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
But my future brother-in-law

341
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
is the law.

342
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,840
Let go.

343
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,120
Let go.

344
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,840
Go away.

345
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,560
Go away.

346
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,440
Go away.

347
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,080
Go away.

348
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,680
Go away.

349
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Go away.

350
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,560
Go away.

351
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,160
Go away.

352
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Go away.

353
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,360
Go away.

354
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:36,920
Let go.

355
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,640
Don't move.

356
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,680
Come on.

357
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,360
Eat more.

358
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,440
You have lost weight.
