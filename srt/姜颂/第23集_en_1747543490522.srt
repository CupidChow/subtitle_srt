1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're here.

4
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,000
I've become more and more like Jiang Jiaojiao.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're the one who did this, right?

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Your hobby, emotion and thoughts

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,000
will be close to her.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,400
And eventually,

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
you'll become her.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,000
I refuse to be Jiang Jiaojiao.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're so eager to

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
put her in my trap?

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,000
Six days.

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
And then,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
after the end of the story,

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
everyone will disappear.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Only you can become Jiang Jiaojiao

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
and live in another world.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Isn't that good?

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Even if it's only six days,

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
I'll still be my Jiang Song.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
Jiang Song is just a fake character.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,800
She's never lived before.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
She knew everything was fake.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
She knew there was no way forward.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you still holding on to?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Or

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
you want to change the ending

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
and make a living for the world?

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Jiang Jiaojiao said

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm a fake.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
My ending

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
is a great disaster.

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
You said the world was about to collapse.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
Everything would be empty.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,800
But

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
the ending is everything.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
A fake

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
is to live with the ending as a guide?

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm not.

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
At this moment,

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
I'm the meaning of my existence.

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
This place

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
is my destination.

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,000
Something's wrong with me.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
But I'm sure

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
the person I'm meeting

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
isn't you.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,800
What do you know about love?

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
You're just a heartless monster.

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Jiao Yi.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's wrong, sir?

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
Did I hurt you?

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
How can you love someone?

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's easy to love someone.

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Just make him happy.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Happy?

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
Why is it so easy?

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,200
I just can't learn it.

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Why am I different from others?

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,200
Why am I a heartless monster?

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Sir.

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm empty.

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm getting more and more afraid.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't make up for it no matter what.

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
What did I do wrong?

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Why is God treating me like this?

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
You didn't do anything wrong.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
It's all fate.

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,600
No.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,200
There must be a reason.

73
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
There must be a reason.

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Sir.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Miss, you...

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,600
What are you doing?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm remembering

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
my own name.

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Qiqi.

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,000
If one day I forget my name,

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
you must remind me.

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Okay?

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
You will remind me, right?

84
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm not going to forget it.

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
I'll remember it.

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I will.

87
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I...

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,000
General.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,400
He's dead.

90
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,000
General.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Look.

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
He's dead.

93
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
General.

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
There's smoke.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Go after him.

96
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,200
That way.

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Mo.

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Qiqi.

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
General Shen.

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Is this sachet yours?

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,000
No.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not mine.

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,000
I picked it up on the side of my foot.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
I thought no one wanted it,

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
so I brought it.

106
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Take it away.

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
No.

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,200
General.

109
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Miss Jiang is here.

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I won't see her.

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
I've already let her in.

112
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
You don't need to plead for her.

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
I don't have to plead for her.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
I just want to see her.

115
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm not going to see her.

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
I'm not going to see her.

117
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm not going to see her.

118
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
I just want to see her.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
You do believe her.

120
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Qiqi and I are like sisters.

121
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,000
We're deeply in love.

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I believe her.

123
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
You really love everyone deeply.

124
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,400
What's that?

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
I made your favorite fish cake.

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Thanks.

127
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
You like Cui Youan.

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,240
The adjutant who deserved to die

129
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,600
changed my memory.

130
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,700
Shen Que!

131
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,120
Shen Que, calm down!

132
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Shen Que!

133
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
If this can make you feel better...

134
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Shen Jian!

135
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Jiao Song!

136
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Do you know that...

137
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
this is the only person I'm afraid of?

138
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Only you.

139
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm afraid to see such a despicable me in your eyes.

140
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,400
But now, I'm not afraid anymore.

141
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm too greedy.

142
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I stole the moonlight.

143
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
And now I want to take it off.

144
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Shen Que!

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Shen... Shen Que!

146
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
No.

147
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Shen...

148
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Eat.

149
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Thank you.

150
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
You...

151
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Don't be sad.

152
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Actually...

153
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Actually, the engagement between me and Shen Que was fake.

154
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I didn't want to tell you.

155
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,400
But I hate seeing girls crying.

156
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I didn't mean it.

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Then you meant...

158
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Qi Qi?

159
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I can let her go home first.

160
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400
But I need to send someone to keep an eye on her.

161
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Thank you.

162
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm not doing this to help you.

163
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I guess she was framed.

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Are they still human?

165
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Why are you so cruel?

166
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm fine, Ruo Xue.

167
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Don't cry.

168
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
It's my fault.

169
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I was too cheap.

170
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
That's why General Shen misunderstood me.

171
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Honey, don't blame General Shen.

172
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
He's just doing his work.

173
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
You explained it so clearly.

174
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
They still beat you.

175
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
You're so cruel.

176
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
But...

177
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I was so scared.

178
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,400
But General Shen has become a little scary.

179
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
He's not like the man I knew.

180
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,400
I think he's just as cold-blooded as his foster father.

181
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
He's so cold-blooded.

182
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Does it hurt?

183
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Don't cry.

184
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
I can't remember.

185
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
You're the most loyal disciple of God Bi.

186
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Seeing Cui You An's great cause coming to be,

187
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Jiang Song Shen Que is gone.

188
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
How can you be so easy to move?

189
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I'm not moving.

190
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
But...

191
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
But what?

192
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm just a weak disciple.

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,400
There's nothing I can do for God Bi.

194
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
You're just too tired.

195
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
How's your injury?

196
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I hurt myself.

197
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
You don't have to worry.

198
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I'll give you my blessing.

199
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Where did you go?

200
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
I couldn't sleep.

201
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
So I went out for a while.

202
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Your injury healed so fast.

203
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Of course.

204
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
You're the one who gave me the medicine.

205
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Qi Qi.

206
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Do you have anything to hide from me?

207
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
No.

208
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
You...

209
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
My lady,

210
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
are you suspecting me?

211
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm Qi Qi.

212
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Because you're Qi Qi,

213
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I want to ask you in person.

214
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
You embroidered this peony, right?

215
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,400
The tail is cut in two.

216
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
The butterfly in Dong Mei's hand

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
is also cut in two.

218
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Of course.

219
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
In this world,

220
00:13:38,400 --> 00:14:00,020
there are two people who are in the

221
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
same position as you.

222
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
You're the same as the real person.

223
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Qi Qi.

224
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
You were forced, right?

225
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
It's been ten years.

226
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
You still found out.

227
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Why?

228
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
The day the real person sent me to the Jiang family

229
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
was the day before the dawn.

230
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
He pointed to the sky

231
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
and told me...

232
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Light will be born in the world.

233
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,400
But darkness will be gone in a few days.

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
When the light comes,

235
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
there will be only joy and no sadness in the world.

236
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Only reunion and no separation.

237
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Will my parents and my sister come back?

238
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
No.

239
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
But by then,

240
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
there will be no other children

241
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
suffering in the world like you.

242
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
That's good.

243
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
What should I do?

244
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
You just need to...

245
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Be your maid.

246
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Qi Qi.

247
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Watch here.

248
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
The carriage will be here soon.

249
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Okay.

250
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
A'Lang.

251
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
There.

252
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
There is a balloon.

253
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Really?

254
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I'll go and have a look.

255
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Jiang Song and Shen Que must be separated.

256
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
This is God's will.

257
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Wasn't he just here?

258
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Qi Qi.

259
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Where is the witch?

260
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
How did you see him?

261
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
What's wrong?

262
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Shen Jun.

263
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
My brother is missing.

264
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
You stay here.

265
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I'll go find him.

266
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Okay.

267
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
The darkness of the darkness

268
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
will bring light.

269
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
For the happiness of all,

270
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Qi Qi.

271
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Jiang Song will die.

272
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Ten years.

273
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
We've known each other for ten years.

274
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Okay.

275
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Even if you don't care about me,

276
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
what about Dong Mei?

277
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
How can you do that?

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
If you follow the real person,

279
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
and be the leading lady,

280
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
he can live without dying.

281
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Not only he can live without dying,

282
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
when this story is over,

283
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
everyone

284
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
can live without dying.

285
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
This is what the real person told you.

286
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
You believe this?

287
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Of course.

288
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I don't exist without a god.

289
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
This world doesn't exist.

290
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Why would he lie to me?

291
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Then why don't you ask your god?

292
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
If he can save you,

293
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
save all the injured,

294
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,400
why would he allow the one who is greedy to have nothing to eat?

295
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
He allows the one who is greedy.

296
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
The one who is close to the people

297
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
can live without dying.

298
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
The poor are bullied.

299
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
The kind are trampled.

300
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
The one who is just in office

301
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
is punished by the emperor.

302
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Can't he hear

303
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
those people who are too selfish

304
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
or too lonely?

305
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Can he save you?

306
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Where is your god

307
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
when you lost your family?

308
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Enough! Stop talking!

309
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Go.

310
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Qiqi.

311
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
The god who can save all the people

312
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
is only me.

313
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Maybe.

314
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Now

315
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
it's time for me to atone.

316
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Qiqi.

317
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Go.
