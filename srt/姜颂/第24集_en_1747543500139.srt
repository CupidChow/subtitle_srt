00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Qiqi has exposed herself.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ye Qin deliberately saved her.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She is useless.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But she knows everything.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't worry.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are the destiny.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No one can stop you.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You think I will believe the destiny?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Of course you should believe.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It seems that the interrogators are here.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They move fast.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Where is she?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No one.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We interrogated Qiqi for a long time.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
She didn't say a word.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Today she suddenly proposed to see you.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Be careful.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Since the bride is here,

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can say something.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
General Shen, let's listen together.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Qi Shi is a real person.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Qiqi.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Qiqi.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Qiqi.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Qiqi.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Qiqi.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Qiqi.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My lady.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Call the doctor.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Call the doctor.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No need.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't kill anyone.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't want to kill anyone.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My lady.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't say it.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My lady.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My lady.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Fortunately,

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I saw you for the last time.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Qiqi.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Qiqi.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Forget it.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My lady.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If there is a next life,

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
we will be together.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Qiqi.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Qiqi.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Qiqi, wake up.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wake up.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're lying to me again, aren't you?

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't you have something to tell me?

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Say it.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Qiqi.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Qiqi.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Qiqi, wake up.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Qiqi.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wake up.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wake up.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Qiqi.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I forgive you.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I forgive you.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I forgive you.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Wake up.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't leave me.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Qiqi.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Qiqi.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Qiqi.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,920
Your Highness!

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,160
I have let my guard down,

73
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,960
and tried to save you.

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,960
I forgive you.

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
Your Ladyship,

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,560
I feel sorry for you,

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,240
as it was before.

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
So I kept to my heart.

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,400
Ye Xing Ke was mistaken by the Prime Minister.

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,840
Since the prince wanted to look into Ye Xing Ke,

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,080
he wasiggle the crime.

82
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,520
The prince's case

83
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,600
to find the Order of Cloud.

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,320
I'm grateful to Prime Minister Cui

85
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,720
for providing the shelter.

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,920
The Spring Festival is in three days.

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,280
Didn't the God say

88
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
he could help me find the Order of Cloud?

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,480
Don't worry.

90
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,760
The Order of Cloud will appear soon.

91
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm on your side.

92
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,040
Thank you, Sister.

93
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,520
Don't mention it.

94
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,040
Brother Give this to me.

95
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Pi, don't cry.

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,920
If you feel burdened by it,

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,520
let bygones be bygones.

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,200
Yurong,

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,860
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,600
This is for Chan Niang.

102
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,160
You told me

103
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,540
you would give it to someone

104
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,860
whose name you love.

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,120
We can take one of them.

106
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,800
I remember everything you said.

107
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,400
There's something I need to make it clear to you.

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,680
What?

109
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
The God wants to control me

110
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,560
and make me Jiang Jiaojiao.

111
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
I can't help but be close to you

112
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,120
because Jiang Jiaojiao once loved Mu Ning.

113
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,560
It wasn't me.

114
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,660
If I keep acting recklessly,

115
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,680
don't panic.

116
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
That isn't my true heart.

117
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,120
I will try my best to avoid you.

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,600
I can't...

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,080
What?

120
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,520
What will you do to me

121
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
after you've stopped loving Mu Ning?

122
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
is fake.

123
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,960
Because it's a mistake.

124
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm Jiang Song.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Who am I in love with?

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
My life is ridiculous.

127
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000
You love Shen Qu,

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,440
you love the world,

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
you love the world.

130
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,200
Why can't you love me more?

131
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,920
Do you know?

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,440
Only you are by my side,

133
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,840
I don't feel like an empty shell.

134
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
I can't save you.

135
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,000
Come on, my lady.

136
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,520
You just

137
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,360
want to make the money.

138
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,400
Then the money

139
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,040
won't come out in vain.

140
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,080
Three days later,

141
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,880
will the world really disappear?

142
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,720
Bixiu,

143
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,080
I'm so small-minded

144
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,680
that I can't fight against that god.

145
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,400
I brought everyone back to the Jiang family

146
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,880
and thought I was in Bifeng Pavilion.

147
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
But I was wrong.

148
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,840
I was wrong.

149
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,600
I was wrong.

150
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
I was wrong.

151
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,240
I was wrong.

152
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Bifeng Pavilion.

153
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,000
But the world is about to disappear.

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
There's nowhere to run.

155
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,960
Do I really have to

156
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
escape from this world alone?

157
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,520
But the me who ran out

158
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
is not me anymore.

159
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
The sky is going to be bright.

160
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
There will be no sunrise.

161
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
I'm afraid

162
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
it's not the right time to leave.

163
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm afraid

164
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,480
it's not the right time to leave.

165
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,480
I'm afraid

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,840
it's not the right time to leave.

167
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
Then don't leave any regrets.

168
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,920
How's the surveillance of the Prime Minister's Mansion?

169
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
The scout reported that

170
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,440
the Prime Minister is in a remote room all day.

171
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,400
Keep a close eye on him.

172
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
Not a single bird can enter the Prime Minister's Mansion.

173
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,600
I know.

174
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,400
The people from the Zhenren Mansion

175
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,000
still won't tell us where the Zhenren is.

176
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,360
Tell me.

177
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
Where is the Zhenren?

178
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Where is the Zhenren?

179
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Stop talking nonsense.

180
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,560
Three.

181
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
Two.

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,400
One.

183
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,680
Miss, don't kill him.

184
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
Shen Que.

185
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,400
Shen Que.

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,280
Zhiyuan.

187
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,640
Zhiyuan.

188
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,480
G fake.

189
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,880
The wind blows through the earth

190
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,600
It's the wind from the Miao Huai

191
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,080
This is not the place you should come

192
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,840
I lost you again

193
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,680
The story is too short

194
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
No need to mention it again

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,520
The wind blows through the earth

196
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,040
The red leaves are falling

197
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,320
Why bother?

198
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,000
Will someone

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,640
grow old with me?

200
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Look at me

201
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,360
Count the stars in the night sky

202
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,120
What do you want?

203
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,320
Can't you see it?

204
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
What can you see?

205
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,040
I'm proposing to you, Shen Qian

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,080
Are you trying to trick me?

207
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,160
I'm not

208
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,160
Enough

209
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,920
tutorial

210
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,000
Enough

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,840
The word becoming a motto

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,560
The whole world asks

213
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,960
I'm not leaving. The wind is not stopping.

214
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,560
Who can understand my heart's sigh?

215
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,960
In the most beautiful scenery, there is only her destiny.

216
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Waiting for my love to meet you again.

217
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,560
The wind is not stopping.

218
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,960
I can't save you.

219
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Tonight, she will go to you.

220
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Let her become yours.

221
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Then let's start over.

222
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Why am I here?

223
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I want to go home.

224
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Why can't I remember the way home?

225
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I want to go home.

226
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Miss Jiang!

227
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Miss Jiang!

228
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,760
I'll take you out.

229
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,960
This is Jiang Jiaojiao's memory. It's not mine.

230
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Jiang Jiaojiao's memory

231
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Zi Yuan.

232
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
What are you doing?

233
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Shen Jun.

234
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Come with me.

235
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
The End

236
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Why did you bring me here?

237
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,960
I want to calm down.

238
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Shen Jun, I want to talk to you.

239
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Okay. What do you want to talk about?

240
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,560
If someone wants to control me, what should I do?

241
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,960
Who dares to control you?

242
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,960
I don't want to talk about it.

243
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I want to talk to you.

244
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,960
If three days later is the end of the world,

245
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,960
would you like to accept the end with me?

246
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
What are you talking about?

247
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Shen Jun, I'm sorry.

248
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I should have told you earlier.

249
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
I like you.

250
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Jiang Song, don't be ridiculous.

251
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
I'm not ridiculous.

252
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,960
I like you.

253
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I only like you.

254
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
What are you afraid of?

255
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,960
If you knew what I did,

256
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
you wouldn't have said you liked me.

257
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I know.

258
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
You really know?

259
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I know.

260
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Shen Jun, you've been through a lot.

261
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,960
After Shaoyuan, I don't know what will happen.

262
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
If I...

263
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
No matter what happens,

264
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,960
I won't regret it since I've made my choice.

265
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm not worthy of you.

266
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm not worthy of you.

267
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
What did he do?

268
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
The wind is getting stronger.

269
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Jiang Song, don't blame me for being ruthless.
