00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's the matter?

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Father.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Do you know how my mother died?

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She was killed by the bandits in her mansion.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why did you kill her?

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Chen Nian is dead.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why do you mention her again?

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I said she is dead.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She should die.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If she didn't die,

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
people would know

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you are a traitor.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go away.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She should die.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If she didn't die,

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
people would know

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you are a traitor.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Forgive me.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What should I do?

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Is it useful to say sorry?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I won't do it again.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You bitch.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll kill you.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What are you doing?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You should die

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
if you are born low.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Of course you should die.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You don't accept it?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hit me.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hit me.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Stop.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Chen Nian.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You almost died

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
with the desire to die.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are the master of the world

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
who knows the way to the heaven.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How can you protect yourself?

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Know the way to the heaven?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Of course.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The Third Prince

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is just a stepping stone

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
for you to get to the heaven.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is your prophecy again.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is your destiny.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why are you so stubborn?

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The secret is out.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Just hide it.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You decide

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
who you are

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
when you get to the throne.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are nothing.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are nothing.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I decide it myself.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hurry.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Here is the excuse

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and I'll see where will you escape.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The opportunity is waiting.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I, Yao Qianqian

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
have fulfilled this prophecy.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I, Yao Qianqian

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
have fulfilled this prophecy.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I, Yao Qianqian

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
have fulfilled this prophecy.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I, Yao Qianqian

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
have fulfilled this prophecy.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I, Yao Qianqian

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
have fulfilled this prophecy.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
We are loyal to Your Majesty.

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,680
We are loyal to Your Majesty.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
How dare you!

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,360
You are using Deng Wengu

82
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,840
to report to His Majesty.

83
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,320
How dare you

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,000
defy the emperor!

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,080
Just because of a prophecy from the Yuyong Order,

86
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,760
His Majesty wants to kill us.

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,160
That's right.

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
Today, we are going to

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,880
kill the emperor

90
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,200
and report to him.

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
The emperor has committed a crime

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,040
that is the same as the common people.

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,400
If we turn the tables under the Qingtian Gate,

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,480
what justice

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
can we give to the country?

96
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,920
That's right.

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,080
We will not change our ways.

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
Guards.

99
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
Take him to the execution.

100
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,040
No need.

101
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
No need.

102
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,320
Your Highness.

103
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560
Right now...

104
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,960
Just be careful.

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,880
spoonful.

106
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,760
Should me get losing d всеディ

107
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,760
I'll be killed immediately.

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
Qingtian.

109
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,240
Father.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Shen Juan, what do you want?

111
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,200
Your Highness, His Majesty asked me

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,000
to take the guilty women back alive.

113
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
When did you get the imperial edict?

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,720
I was ordered to kill them all.

115
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,960
You...

116
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,480
Your Highness.

117
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
His Majesty died?

118
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
The imperial edict is here.

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,920
Zhao Yong, take the edict.

120
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,520
Your Highness,

121
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,480
will I be sent to prison?

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
By Heaven's will,

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
By His Majesty's edict,

124
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,000
the third prince Zhao Yong

125
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,720

132
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,240
I let you live in such a terrible world.

134
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Cui You An.

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,200
Without Zhao You,

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,200
I can't see you get to that position.

145
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Hurry.

146
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Hurry.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
Catch him.

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Thank you, mother.

149
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Give me one more chance.

150
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,080
You want me to kick you out?

151
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes.

152
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,480
Only in this way

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
will His Majesty let you go.

154
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,080
But...

155
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,040
Shen Juan.

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,240
It's the most important thing to live.

157
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I'll give you a hidden weapon.

158
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Hidden weapon?

159
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
If you place it here,

160
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
the hidden weapon will explode.

161
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,160
But it's only when you're in a hurry.

162
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
I have something for you.

163
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
What is it?

164
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Next time.

165
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I'll see you off.

166
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll see you off.

167
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I'll see you off.

168
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
I'll see you off.

169
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
I'll see you off.

170
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I'll see you off.

171
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll see you off.

172
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
I'll see you off.

173
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
I'll see you off.

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I'll see you off.

175
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,640
OK.

176
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,880
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

177
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,520
Yes.

178
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,800
When I lost my concentration,

179
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:24,160
the sudden semiert sort of

180
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
to the farthest place.

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,160
Shen Que.

182
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,120
I'll accompany you to see the moon in the future.

183
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Tomorrow at noon,

184
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,400
we'll go to Baoshang Road.

185
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
You really came.

186
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
You killed the Third Prince.

187
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,480
You can only use your grandson to inherit the throne.

188
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,400
He pardoned the criminal

189
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,640
and caught Zhizhou.

190
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,400
You should be satisfied.

191
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,240
Come with me.

192
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,280
Go?

193
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,560
I killed someone.

194
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,920
You are the heroine of this world.

195
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,760
It's nothing to kill a prince.

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,000
It's okay to kill the whole world.

197
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,080
But I can't kill Cui You'an.

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,200
My dear,

199
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
what are you embroidering?

200
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,120
It must be for General Shen.

201
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,680
I remember he has a similar bell.

202
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,640
Yes.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,320
I can't hide anything from you.

204
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,360
Give it to him,

205
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,640
and I'll pretend I don't know him.

206
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,720
All right,

207
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,000
you can give it to him tonight.

208
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,920
Is it beautiful?

209
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I'm going to give Qianqian's ashes back to her family.

210
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,320
If she can give Qianqian such a good child,

211
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
her parents will be very happy.

212
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Yes.

213
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,520
Her father is a loyal minister.

214
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,520
Her family is a good family that is close to civilization.

215
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
What a pity.

216
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
I didn't expect you would be so reliable.

218
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,520
I told you I have my own way.

219
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,920
Jiang Jiaojiao, thank you.

220
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
I created such a bad world.

221
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
I have to say it myself.

222
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,120
You have changed a lot.

223
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
I met someone.

224
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,920
You are...

225
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
It's me.

226
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,920
Jiang Jiaojiao, I'm ten years old.

227
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,320
Why is it you?

228
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm disappointed to see myself after I grow up.

230
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,520
I think you are cool.

231
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,520
You dare to fight against the bad guys.

232
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,520
I dare not even break out of school.

233
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
But no one cares about me.

234
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,520
No one loves me.

235
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,120
I like you.

236
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
You like me.

237
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
I always like you.

238
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
I like you the most in the whole universe.

239
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
More than Doraemon?

240
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,120
More than Doraemon.

241
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,520
I suddenly remember I was ten years old.

242
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,320
What was my biggest dream?

243
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,520
To be a princess waiting for the prince to wake up?

244
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,520
It seems not.

245
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
What was it?

246
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,720
To be a biologist.

247
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Yes.

248
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,120
I remember it.

249
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
To live.

250
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,920
To get up from here.

251
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,120
To go to Himalaya to see the lily.

252
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,320
To go to the tropical rainforest to find the wild animals.

253
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,320
To go to the North Pacific to catch the golden fish.

254
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
To go to wherever you want.

255
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,120
Don't be afraid of no companions.

256
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,520
I'm always here.

257
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,120
I'm always here.

258
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,720
We are the best in the world.

259
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm going back to my world.

260
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,520
Are you going to be with me?

261
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,720
No.

262
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,320
I promised Shen Que to stay.

263
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
What's wrong?

264
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Nothing.

265
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,920
I probably finished the plot of the novel with my memory.

266
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
It's incomplete.

267
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,920
But it may be useful to you.

268
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
Don't read it now.

269
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,320
Why?

270
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,920
Knowing the future may not be a good thing.

271
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,120
It's a half-truth half-truth book.

272
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,720
You can't believe what's written in the book.

273
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,320
And you can't be blind.

274
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,120
It's a good thing to be uncertain about the ending.

275
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
You're sure.

276
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,920
You're dead.

277
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,920
If you still have hope for the future,

278
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,120
you'll be more unwilling and despair.

279
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,920
After so many things,

280
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,920
what else can make me despair?

281
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,120
Put the book away.

282
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,520
If nothing happens in the future,

283
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
you'll forget it.

284
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,120
But if you can't go on one day,

285
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,920
you can look at it again.

286
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,120
You'll know it.

287
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Thank you.

288
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm leaving.

289
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Take care.

290
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
I'm leaving.

291
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,720
I know you stayed for Shen Que.

292
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,520
But I have to remind you.

293
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Human nature is the hardest to figure out.

294
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,120
I don't mean to shake you.

295
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,720
But I'll wait for you.

296
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,320
I'll wait for you

297
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,520
in two hours.

298
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,320
The End
