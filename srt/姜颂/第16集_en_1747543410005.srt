1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where are they?

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're afraid that you'll live on?

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll use my power to re-enact the case of the late Crown Prince.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nonsense.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Prime Minister's Mansion,

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the Empress and the Third Prince, all of them.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You should be afraid of them.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Third Prince

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you don't tell me,

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll let the blood run dry.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Shen Que, His Majesty is calling you.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Great General.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you lose your life for a few criminal,

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
is it worth it?

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because if they think I'm a scoundrel,

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
my life is worth more.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They'll die.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yin Yongling will disappear completely.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Heshan is unstable.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's inevitable to sacrifice for the overall situation.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you're afraid that the late Crown Prince's future

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
will be in danger?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,760
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm afraid that the late crown prince's wronged brother

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
will be washed away

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,120
and the court officials will use his grandson.

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,280
Then the third prince

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,400
can't succeed in inheriting the throne.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,480
How dare you!

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,160
You're a smart man.

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,080
But you're too young.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,360
You don't know that

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,320
in one's life,

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,760
whether it's a man or a queen,

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
the last word is only two words.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,160
I have no choice.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,080
How is he related to me?

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
I only know

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,360
that there are too many sisters in this world

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
with the skin of Guangxian.

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,880
You're a bad guy, but you don't know.

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,960
You were a honest young man

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,920
under my care.

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,400
If you're not even a man,

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
what else can I believe?

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
I don't want to

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,160
be that kind of person.

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,320
I've seen many times

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,720
that people who think they can change the world

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,160
will eventually be

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,400
a drop of blood in my sword

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,600
and be destroyed by their evil deeds.

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
I've forgotten

57
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,040
what their names are.

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,000
Your Majesty.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
Their names

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,640
are your name.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
Your Majesty.

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,360
Your Majesty.

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,200
Guards.

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,800
Take Shen Juan away.

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,160
Your Majesty.

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,960
Your Majesty.

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
Name.

68
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,440
Name.

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,720
Name.

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,600
Name.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,840
Name.

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,120
Her Majesty.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
Hand.

74
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
Here.

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,560
Help.

76
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,280
Someone should have helped her.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,480
Her Highness has five fishes.

78
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,440
Five fishes can eat nightmares.

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
Maybe she's learning it now.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Five fishes?

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Where is Her Highness?

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
In your room.

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
My room?

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
Her Highness is a goddess of fire.

85
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,760
She likes your place.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,360
You should be happy.

87
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,640
His Majesty has approved it.

88
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,840
What's the manufacturing process?

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
What?

90
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
Princess Changning.

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,320
Please wait a moment.

92
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,680
I'll tell you a story first.

93
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
踨耳恭聽.

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,200
One day, the 잘� galaxy frompicked the fish.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
It was an ordinary fish.

96
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,780
he slowly most probably

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,960
continues to root rope and

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,840
then

99
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,280
he came up with

100
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,320
e-sports

101
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,300
before that

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,340
your master

103
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,360
said

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,580
after he

105
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,920
returned from prison

106
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,360
he

107
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,640
Maybe they are.

108
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,800
But how do you know

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,360
there is a

110
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
Night Pearl in the fish?

111
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,440
It doesn't matter.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,080
What matters is

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
that the nightmare begins with it

114
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
and ends with it.

115
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,120
Isn't it?

116
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,280
Yes.

117
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,520
I'm lucky to get five fish.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,040
It's said that there is a Night Pearl in one fish.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,280
I don't want to repeat the story of the fisherman.

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,640
So I want to give it to you.

121
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
You are wise.

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,080
But you don't want the fish

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
and the Night Pearl.

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,640
What do you want?

125
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,200
Stop.

126
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll tell you later.

127
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,680
You can check

128
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,800
if there is anything you want.

129
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Where is it?

130
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,560
The fish is in front of you.

131
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Open it.

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
The Night Pearl is in front of you.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,840
Where are you hiding it?

134
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,360
There is no burn here.

135
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,360
Always remain in the change of pace.

136
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,560
The Night Pearl.

137
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,880
Never give up.

138
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,600
Love it.

139
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,840
After we get thenahme,

140
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
You didn't give me what I wanted.

141
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Why should I give you what you want?

142
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
What do you want?

143
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
Lotus-soup fish cake.

144
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
What?

145
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
You made these fish

146
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,080
into lotus-soup fish cake for me.

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
Then you tried to please me,

148
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
seduce me,

149
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,600
and kneel down to me.

150
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,800
Then I'll tell you where the criminal is.

151
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,640
Who are you?

152
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,400
Jiang Jiaojiao.

153
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,120
She's already dead.

154
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
I'm

155
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,600
the one who tells stories.

156
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
The Han family is simple.

157
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,360
You can live there if you like.

158
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,280
But you can't

159
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,000
make a joke out of it.

160
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,200
Even if I can't kill your body,

161
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
I can destroy your spirit.

162
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
Jiang Song is the best knife.

163
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
How can I let you find it easily?

164
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,920
If Ancao Cam зависed from my design,

165
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,680
I'd have zones in my heart

166
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
to protect him.

167
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,040
It's said

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,240
your medical education can read 너는 생 свет을

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
I can sleep quite well these days

170
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,320
The story I want to tell you

171
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,000
In the connectivity qué Phi can build

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:32,080
is

173
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,680
You have finally become different today.

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,560
To readily let Sai Chu

175
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,120
lead you to a different world...

176
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,920
What's wrong?

177
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,200
The third prince.

178
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,400
How can the unfilial be the ruler of the world, Your Majesty?

179
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,200
Cousin.

180
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,880
What's up?

181
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,280
Shen Que has revealed the whereabouts of the criminal.

182
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Father allowed him to arrest them

183
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,160
and take them back to the Dai Zui Palace.

184
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,280
Shen Que has spoken?

185
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,040
He's been released for three days and nights.

186
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,600
I guess he can't make it.

187
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,600
He's afraid of death.

188
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,240
We'll see.

189
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
But the problem is

190
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,120
Father let him arrest them alive.

191
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,440
Does he want to find Huo Yuan

192
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
and help the late Crown Prince?

193
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,520
In this case,

194
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,520
Zhao Chengze can be the crown prince.

195
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,000
Where's the criminal?

196
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,280
Master.

197
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,400
I didn't find him.

198
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,880
Where's the movement?

199
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,680
Go over there.

200
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,600
Go!

201
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,480
Cui Xuzhi,

202
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
I found your letter.

203
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,120
Cui Youan.

204
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,480
Long time no see.

205
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
It's you.

206
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Jiang Jiaojiao.

207
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,800
The story continues.

208
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,320
There's a secret.

209
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,280
It continues.

210
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
One day,

211
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,640
the fisherman stopped having nightmares

212
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,400
and got released.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,920
He killed the fish.

214
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,720
He...

215
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
The fisherman was a woman?

216
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
The fisherman wasn't His Majesty.

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
It wasn't me.

218
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,320
It was Jiang Jiaojiao.

219
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,880
It's such a simple story.

220
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
You just figured it out.

221
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,000
By the way,

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,560
the fish you're looking for is in the room.

223
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,240
Maybe you can save it

224
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,560
if you come alone.

225
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,480
Jiang Jiaojiao.

226
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,260
Jinli

227
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,720
Chen Secondwhelm.

228
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,760
ah

230
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,140
夫人饶命

231
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,680
정환

232
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,500
uk

233
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,100
יך

234
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
well

235
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,920
well

236
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,560
you must die

237
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,660
not to let the others know

238
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:47,680
we will meet again.

239
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,380
My shit.

240
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
You said

241
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
she must wake from the nightmare.

242
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,360
If she wakes up, I can't help her.

243
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,600
Brat.

244
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,480
But you will kill her

245
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,920
so that I can get rid of

246
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,240
your nightmare.

247
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,560
No.

248
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,640
No.

249
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,480
Please.

250
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
I beg you.

251
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,680
I can give you

252
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,760
whatever you want.

253
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,520
It's too late.

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,880
It's your turn to have a nightmare.

255
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,640
No.

256
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,200
No.

257
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,880
Lady Jiang.

258
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,560
Lady Jiang.

259
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,880
Lady Jiang.

260
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,520
Lady Jiang.

261
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Mr. Cui.

262
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
I won't let anything happen to you.

263
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll take you to the doctor now.

264
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,000
Why are you

265
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
not willing to let me go?

266
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,320
Because only you can save me.

267
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,480
You're a high-ranking officer.

268
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,360
How can I save you?

269
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,720
No.

270
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,880
No.

271
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm not a high-ranking officer.

272
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,920
I'm...

273
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,720
You can't let others know you're safe.

274
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,400
You...

275
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
You An Shi.

276
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,520
I'm not.

277
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,320
Who are you?

278
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,000
You An Shi.

279
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You're born in the underworld.

280
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,200
I was born by the tea plant.

281
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,080
I'm the underworld.

282
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,920
My foster mother

283
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,800
killed my biological mother.

284
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,160
It's not your fault.

285
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,680
Really?

286
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
It's fake.

287
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,840
So this is the secret in your heart.

288
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,760
You divided people into three, six, and nine groups.

289
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,680
You're the one who's the most out of the way.

290
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,200
Ridiculous.

291
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,880
Cui You An.

292
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,240
Listen to me.

293
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,880
If it weren't for me,

294
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,240
you wouldn't have been so cruel.

295
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,160
If it weren't for me,

296
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,080
you wouldn't be the leading man.

297
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,640
You're the leading man

298
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,960
because I chose you.

299
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
In fact,

300
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
you're nothing.

301
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,120
If I do this,

302
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I can really force Cui You An to die.

303
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,320
I can only bet one thing.

304
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,320
Even if he doesn't die this time,

305
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,120
I can still

306
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,720
make him fall from a high position.

307
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,600
How?

308
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,280
The Third Prince is stupid as a pig.

309
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,040
He's just a rock.

310
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,680
The ending of the story

311
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,640
is Cui You An will be the emperor.

312
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,640
But

313
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,960
what if there's no Third Prince?

314
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,200
You can move the Third Prince?

315
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,120
I have my own way.

316
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
But why don't you know

317
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,920
that Cui You An's birth mother is Channiang?

318
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
I have no impression of this.

319
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,120
I didn't care about Channiang at first.

320
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,960
But when I was in the Prime Minister's Mansion,

321
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,920
seeing her drawing the picture of her mother,

322
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,280
the servants were also

323
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
covering up for Channiang's death.

324
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,240
I suspect there's another secret.

325
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,640
So

326
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,520
I kidnapped Nanny Jin.

327
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,640
She said Cui You An

328
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,960
was born by Prime Minister and Channiang.

329
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,160
But she was raised by her mother since she was a child.

330
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,400
Seeing the relationship between Cui You An and Channiang

331
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
getting better and better,

332
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,040
and the rumors about her birth mother,

333
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
the mother

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,800
killed Channiang.

335
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,760
It happened that

336
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,400
Cui You An met her.

337
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,920
Your Highness.

338
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,680
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,480
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,240
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
