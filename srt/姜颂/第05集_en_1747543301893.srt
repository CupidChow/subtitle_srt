00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm so tired.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why don't you just

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
bury me here?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Where will your friend

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
lie if you bury me here?

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Father, you have a home.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll give you one day to seek justice.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Tonight, at this hour,

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
leave me alone.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I owe you my life.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Tonight,

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll pay you back.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I wanted to follow him to have a better future,

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but he ruined my face.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What a waste of time.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wait.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What's wrong?

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You...

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You... You hit me?

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm the master,

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and you're the servant.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're the one who hit me.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Kneel down.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not you.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Didn't you say

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
everyone is equal?

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can betray you.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why should I be equal to you?

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My lady,

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
don't betray me.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm wrong.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I really know I'm wrong.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You should treat your ancient people

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
in the way your ancient people do.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You should have done that earlier.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Prime Minister.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go away.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know where my grandson is.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to make a deal with you.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ridiculous.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How could you know that?

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's just a coincidence.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a long story.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is a serious matter.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I dare not lie to you.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What do you want?

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I want you to help me get rid of someone.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Someone who is loyal to you.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Who?

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Someone who wants to replace me.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A fake.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Bring the criminal.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But he attacked you.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And he killed Liu Ming and Die.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's him.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Mother.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mother.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm scared.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm scared.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm scared.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mother.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm scared.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Zhizhou.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Maruhu has a brain problem.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He gets sick from time to time.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He can't control himself

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
after getting sick.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yesterday,

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
he attacked this lady

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
not out of his own will.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But he got sick from the wind.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have a diagnosis

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
from Dr. Wang in the south of the city

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
to cure Maruhu's disease.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Bring it here.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
According to the law,

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the criminal who got sick from the wind

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is not allowed to be punished in prison.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
According to the law,

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the family of Maruhu

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is not allowed to release him

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
after he is locked up in his house.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't agree.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He was pretending to be crazy.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He was clearly awake last night.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You woman.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You have a father and a son.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are not glorious.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you have to be so ridiculous?

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Besides,

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
he died because he was a crazy woman.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Retreat.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I heard that Maruhu was released without punishment.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Released without punishment?

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It seems that Maruhu

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
has a lot of people behind him.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Where is Jiang Song now?

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I was careless

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and let him run away.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He won't run away.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then he...

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Eat whatever you want.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Song Fang, come and have a look.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Go.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Come and have a look.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just look around.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Stop.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Stop.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You are not allowed to go in the house.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't you know

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
how the death of a crazy woman

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
is like?

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Stop.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Stop.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Stop.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't stop.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Stop.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Stop.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Stop.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Stop.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't stop.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Stop.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Stop.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Stop.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Stop.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Stop.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Stop.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Stop.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Stop.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Stop.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Stop.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Stop.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Stop.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Stop.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go ahead.

140
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Good!

141
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,840
Come on!

142
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Beat me!

143
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Beat me!

144
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
You deserve it.

145
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,280
I'll let you die

146
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,840
and you'll pay for it.

147
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Let me go!

148
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,640
Let me go!

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Let me go!

150
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,640
Let me go!

151
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,960
Let me go!

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let me go!

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
It's done.

154
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,160
Go pack up.

155
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Yes.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,440
That's all.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
How...

158
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
How could this be?

159
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,240
I forgot to tell you

161
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,520
that I've applied poison on my body.

162
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,720
To be precise,

163
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,560
it's a drug specially used in the countryside

164
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,800
to kill animals.

165
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,600
It's perfect for you, isn't it?

166
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,640
Are you hurt?

174
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,760
Did you do it?

175
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,560
I can see what you're doing,

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,400
and you don't think it's a good idea?

177
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
You...

178
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Tell me,

179
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,280
did you play tricks?

180
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
You can't kill me.

181
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
Li Chen was looking at you.

182
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Yeah,

183
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
God is fair-sk mouthed.

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
I'm scared.

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,020
This is what you call

186
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,900
not being able to see anything.

187
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,920
Let's go over to

188
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,700
the Temple

189
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,400
Just confess your stack.

190
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
I want to prove it.

191
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Year 2021.

192
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
You must live?

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,280
No.

194
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,360
You want to kill yourself

195
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,680
before it's digital time?

196
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
Jiang Song.

197
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,520
Why don't you want to live?

198
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,000
I know

199
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,160
life is not worth it.

200
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,600
But I still cherish my life.

201
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
They always say we should wait for the next life.

202
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,680
They say the future is beautiful

203
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,480
when the spirit is alive.

204
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
The next life...

205
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,000
The next life...

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,320
Will it really happen?

207
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,840
It's time.

208
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
It's time to talk.

209
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,120
Fate.

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
It's time.

211
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
It's time.

212
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,240
I'll give it back to you.

213
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,440
If you don't do it,

214
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,200
I'll regret it.

215
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
Agent Situ Pei.

216
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,520
Come in.

217
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,040
Get out.

218
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,440
Work sender Xie.

219
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,120
This is for Xie Xies.

220
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,200
To bottom them all up.

221
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Should I beilen them to legality?

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,920
You're a fool.

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
You brought up that family

224
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
and ended up with me.

225
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,880
Useless.

226
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,680
Go with your new master

227
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,000
and be a good dog.

228
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,120
Ask him

229
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,960
to buy you a good place next time.

230
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,720
You brat.

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,080
I've already given you the money.

232
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,880
Go.

233
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,080
Thank you.

234
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
You're free now.

235
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,160
Thank you.

236
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Thank you.

237
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Thank you.

238
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Thank you.

239
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,080
Thank you.

240
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,160
Thank you.

241
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Thank you.

242
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
Thank you.

243
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Thank you.

244
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Thank you.

245
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Thank you.

246
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,280
Why are you running away?

247
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
The doctor said

248
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,080
if you don't take good care of yourself, you'll die.

249
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,400
The doctor said

250
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
I've never seen someone as miserable as you.

251
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,640
There's no meat on your body.

252
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
You haven't eaten or drank for a long time, right?

253
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,720
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,520
I'll get you all the medicine you want.

255
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,400
You're not allowed to leave.

256
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,400
What's next?

257
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,560
What's next?

258
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,720
Wait until your pity is consumed up.

259
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,240
Wait until your superiority is satisfied.

260
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
What are you talking about?

261
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,520
What do you mean?

262
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,200
Sell me to the next master, right?

263
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,400
I won't sell you.

264
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm not your master.

265
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,920
You're not my slave.

266
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,120
We're friends.

267
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,240
You're not allowed to leave.

268
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,480
Move.

269
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,120
No.

270
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,160
Fine.

271
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,480
You run once.

272
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,480
I'll chase you once.

273
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,880
You run a hundred times and a thousand times.

274
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,560
I'll chase you a hundred times and a thousand times.

275
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,080
I won't give up on you.

276
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,200
Don't worry.

277
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,560
Hey,

278
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
I can't go any further.

279
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,960
Your brother wants to leave you.

280
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,640
You have to.

281
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,400
But ilsu is like a assignemst to you.

282
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,800
We've been verycilky for many years.

283
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,280
You gotta keep the goodicle.

284
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,680
Is there any way he can vote your bishop?

285
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,780
I'll stop SPD and give you everything you have to give him.

286
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,460
Un أي idea

287
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,300
of how Great Sheng put it

288
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,900
to you

289
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:40,300
Bring out my

290
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,420
Let go.

291
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,220
Where are you going?

292
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,940
No, you have to go back with me.

293
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,820
I'm going back with you.

294
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,260
Where are you going?

295
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,300
You think of the past and sit still.

296
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,820
Sit still.

297
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,980
When the rain falls, it turns into a wind.

298
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,220
Like a rainbow.

299
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,820
Your smile is like the red sun in the heart.

300
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,780
It turns out to be nothing.

301
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,220
The heart that met is about to

302
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,740
be in a state of indecision.

303
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,980
Even if it's hard to change,

304
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,980
the more you touch, the more you lose control.

305
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,220
The heart is lacking courage and is in the arms.

306
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,980
Forgive me for not letting go.

307
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,220
This step is a dream.

308
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,860
But I can't live up to my love.

309
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,580
I admit that your skill of hiding the truth

310
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,220
has improved.

311
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,660
But I can always find you.

312
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,380
Please eat.

313
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,820
It's good.

314
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,780
When the rain falls, it turns into a wind.

315
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,980
It disturbs people and makes them dream.

316
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,340
Whose smile is so beautiful?

317
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,100
The smile is so annoying.

318
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,660
It's so sweet.

319
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,580
I can't get out of the old cage.

320
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,420
You are like a knife.

321
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,060
It's easy to cut through the fire.

322
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,540
Easy to cut through the fire.

323
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,780
When the rain falls, it turns into a wind.

324
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,020
Like a rainbow.

325
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,740
Your smile is like the red sun in the heart.

326
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,620
Is it good?

327
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,580
It turns out that love is not selfish.

328
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,820
The heart that I want to see is about to...

329
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,620
I found you, Jiang Sang.

330
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,860
The five-year-old puzzle is over.

331
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,820
The shadow and the light are both empty.

332
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,580
Losing you is like a dream.

333
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,860
No matter how many nights I have,

334
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,500
I can't live up to my love.

335
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,220
The five-year-old puzzle is over.

336
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,540
risk my life to return to you.

337
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,100
I've changed.

338
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,580
There is no hesitation for me.

339
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:54,100
I did let go of the

340
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,020
inside feelings.

341
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,540
I didn't put up with

342
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,340
the tragic movie either.

343
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,100
You went to the elixir shutters.

344
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,660
I've already touched it.

345
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,540
You touched under the curtain."

346
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,780
Sometimes you fall into the trap.
