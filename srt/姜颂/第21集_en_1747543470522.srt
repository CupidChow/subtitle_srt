1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
General, that's the Shendu Tower.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Listen to me.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The old rules.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The one who wants to fight me

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
will lose.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you lose,

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you'll get me a big gold.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you win,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
you'll get the gold.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And the meat ticket.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The Shendu brothers

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
use the meat ticket as bait

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to challenge others.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They won the battle.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I wonder how much they won.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Mr. Chu,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
are you interested?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not a man who can do many things.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Today's meat ticket

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is a good treasure.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
the son of Duke Zhen.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No one is going to save him?

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Whoever saves the son of Duke Zhen

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
will have a bright future.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Who can beat me?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Boring.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm leaving.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll do it.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you doing?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going to make money.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're going to die.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's none of your business.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
General Shen,

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
do you still love me?

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't forget,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you're not a man who can do many things.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You said it.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Wait and see.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The young lady

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is in good shape.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She's not good at fighting.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She's going to fight a tear-jerker.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You only care about her beauty.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're so good at fighting.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Go up.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's going on?

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm here to save you.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Jiang Suo,

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm so tired of you.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Young lady,

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm afraid you're in the wrong place.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
After all,

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm not your little lover.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're talking too much.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you afraid to fight with me?

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You want to die?

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shen Tulong has practiced bodyguarding.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's invincible.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
With a glance,

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can see that

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Shen Tulong's fate is in danger.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's hit the target with the first move.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Shen Tulong is in danger.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In danger?

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Three,

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
two,

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
one.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
General,

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
don't worry.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Jiang Suo.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Good.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How come?

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Isn't Shen Tulong her destiny?

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It seems that the little beauty

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
has a problem.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She's not the one who can save you.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She's not the one who can save you.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
She's not the one who can save you.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The little beauty seems to have prepared.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But you've done something very important wrong.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I thought you were powerful.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Get up.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Get up.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Get up.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Get up.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is a book about the future

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
of the half-truth and half-fake.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can't write what's written in the book.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You can't write it recklessly.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're not Shen Tulong.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're Shen Tuhu.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Jiang Suo,

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
stop fighting.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I won't.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you're forcing me to release the Dongmei...

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not forcing you.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The way

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is the way of people.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you don't go,

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
where will you find the way?

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you think you can survive?

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't think so.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll wait and see.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Escaping

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
shouldn't be a woman's destiny.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Weaknesses only give up power.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What I want to do

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
is to plant roots in this land.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No matter how poor or evil,

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to break out of my own world.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Kill him.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Kill him.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Kill him.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Kill him.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Kill him.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Kill him.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Kill him.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Jiang Suo.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's okay.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's a fake dagger.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's okay.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Good.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Good.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Good.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Good.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Good.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Good.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Good.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Your Lady Jiang

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
is interesting.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good.

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Good.

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Good.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Good.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Good.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Take it.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Good.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I declare

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Lady Jiang won.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Good.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Good.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Good.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Good.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Good.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Good.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Good.

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Good.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Good.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Good.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Good.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Good.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Good.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good.

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Shen Juan.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Good.

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Good.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Good.

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Good.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Go after her.

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Good.

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good.

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Good.

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Good.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Good.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Good.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Good.

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Good.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So beautiful.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So beautiful.

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
My Lady.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You won the gold.

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You not only stopped the debt

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but also rebuilt the house.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I also invited the doctor to

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
prescribe medicine for Rui Xue.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And also made new clothes for everyone.

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We have a good life.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The luxury meal from Chun Jiang House is here.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Come and eat.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My Lady.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's go eat.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Great.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can finally eat the meal.

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm so happy.

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't cry, Rui Xue.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't cry.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't cry.

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If only Dong Mei was here.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't worry.

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The money I have left

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is enough to pay for Dong Mei.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Eat.

203
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Eat.

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You have guts to say

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you won't eat or drink.

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm not afraid of you.

207
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You have guts.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
General.

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I didn't expect that

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
it was Lady Jiang

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
who helped me to live in the Shentu Lake.

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's a pity that Shentulong ran away.

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
By the way, General.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Qin Si Zhe gave you

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
his mountain a few days ago.

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you are the owner of the mountain.

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What?

218
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why didn't you say so earlier?

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I wanted to tell you that day.

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You said

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Qin Si Zhe didn't need to tell you.

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You...

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
General Shen.

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Lady Jiang wants to see you.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm here to pay for Dong Mei.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is one thousand taels.

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't need your money.

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why?

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Just treat it as

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
a reward for the Shentu Lake.

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But if you want to give it to me,

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it's okay.

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you.

234
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can take her back now.

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll take Lady Jiang to the prison.

236
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll send you there.

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll send you to the prison.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll send you to the prison.

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll send you to the prison.

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll send you to the prison.

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll send you to the prison.

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll send you to the prison.

243
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's go.

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Dong Mei.

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Dong Mei.

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We're home.

247
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Dong Mei.

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What's going on?

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
General, Dong Mei is dead.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Has anyone been here last night?

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
General,

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know.

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Go and call all the jade clans

254
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that were on duty last night.

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Shen Que.

257
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The one that Dong Mei and Lin Ziqian

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
have been holding in their hands,

259
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
is it the one you've been wearing?

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You suspect me?

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Answer me.

262
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I...

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why should I answer you?

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because it's a matter of life and death, Shen Que.

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
In your eyes,

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

267
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then why are you asking?

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Then why are you asking?

270
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Then why are you asking?

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

273
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Then why are you asking?

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Then why are you asking?

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

277
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then why are you asking?

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Then why are you asking?

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then why are you asking?

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Then why are you asking?

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Then why are you asking?

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm just a monster who's killed by the world.

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Then why are you asking?
