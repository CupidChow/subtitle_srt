1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Come on.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Eat more.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You've lost weight.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you sad?

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Look at you now.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You have nothing.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So what?

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you need my help?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How can you help me?

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jiang Jiaojiao thought

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
she was the creator of this world.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She was wrong.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
She made a wish to God of B.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So God created a perfect life for her

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
according to her novel.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But she didn't cherish it.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So she was trapped in her own dream.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
She was trapped in her own dream.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, so...

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Her organs were broken.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Again and again.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Enough.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why are you so nervous?

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a great thing for you.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're a little character

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
who didn't survive in the novel.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now you have a chance.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What chance?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You've always wanted to leave.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The heroine is the key to connect the two worlds.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As long as you become Jiang Jiaojiao,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the heroine,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and complete the story,

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you can open the gate and get freedom.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can become a real person

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
from a few lines of words.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What if I don't?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No?

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come with me.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is it beautiful?

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Xiu Xiu.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's so beautiful.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Xiu Xiu, get up.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She also escaped and resisted me.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But she was forced to go home and went crazy.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Not only her,

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
do you think

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
how did Dian go crazy?

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In this world,

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
if you don't listen,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you can only be a crazy woman.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now you have three choices.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You become them.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The second is to listen to me.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Become Jiang Jiaojiao.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The third is

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
to ask for advice.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But when you see a new person laughing,

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
you don't see the old person crying.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Will she still help you?

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't want this.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why should I make the choice you gave me?

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't allow it.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you think you can escape?

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I won't escape.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you for bringing me to see them.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I understand.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Escaping should not be the fate of women.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Weakness will only give up power.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What I want to do

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
should be rooted in this soil.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No matter how poor and evil,

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
will also find my own world.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a pity.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This world

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
is about to end.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What do you mean?

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is a fantasy world.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a ship that is about to sink.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Even if you don't be Jiang Jiaojiao,

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it will end at the end.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why don't you seize the opportunity

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to win a new ship ticket

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and open a real life?

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How long?

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ten days.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is the age rule.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't drink too much.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can drink together.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Drink.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Whatever.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't chase after the dead.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Drink.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll drink.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I thought you ran away.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So you went to buy wine

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
to pay respects to your father.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I came to pay respects to you.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're a big man.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you looking for death?

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you doing?

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let my friend go.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or I'll burn this place.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mr. Qin.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let him go.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let him go.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Shut up.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't believe you.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll count to three.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Three.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Two.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Stop.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let him go.

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
As soon as you go out,

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll send someone to chase you back.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can't run away next time.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Someone wants to know

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
about the story of a maid

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
who was punished by the princess

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
at the birthday banquet of Mr. Qin.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nonsense.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're lying.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It seems that

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mr. Qin was in bed

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
a few days ago.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's true.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I've heard about it.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You've heard about it?

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mr. Qin bought a songwriter a few days ago.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When he was about to perform the cloud,

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
he found...

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Shut up.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's a four-part song.

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How did you know?

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
My friend and I

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
will be severely damaged.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The whole capital will know

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
that you, Mr. Qin,

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
have been in all the troubles in your life.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Understand?

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There's one more thing.

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I want you to let Dongmei go.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We'll pay back

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
your loss slowly.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I really can't do that.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why?

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
According to the law,

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
the mountain master can only let go

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
if he doesn't investigate.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I gave that mountain

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
to my brother-in-law Shen Que yesterday.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You have to go to him

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
if you want to save him.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm fine.

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It seems that Xiu Xiu's family

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
hasn't changed a bit.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Xiu Xiu, you look so beautiful.

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't move.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shu Ping.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Xiu Xiu.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No matter what,

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
as long as we're together,

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
life will get better.

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But Dongmei is suffering.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I gave that mountain

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to my brother-in-law Shen Que yesterday.

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You have to go to him

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
if you want to save him.

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm fine.

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm fine.

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm fine.

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm fine.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm fine.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm fine.

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
From Yao's Mansion half a year ago,

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
we've got seven houses

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
that are in the night-walking class.

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We finally caught the fire this time.

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Two little heads of the night-walking class

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
are here.

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Shen Tulong and Shen Tuhu.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yao Xiaozhi said

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the night-walking class is loyal to the Empress Dowager.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you think something is wrong?

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
With the help of the Empress Dowager,

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we can train so many night-walking classes.

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You suspect the Prime Minister's Mansion?

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
His Majesty just ascended the throne.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He's not stable.

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's not sure of his iron and stone skills.

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He can't act rashly.

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I understand.

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
General, there's one more thing.

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Qin Sizhe will give you the money in two days.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All right.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't tell me about him.

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
General Shen.

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
General Shen.

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What's your name?

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
General Shen.

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,920
Why did you let her go?

211
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
I know that according to the law,

212
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,840
I can give Master Huai a thousand taels of silver.

213
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,200
But Dongmei is weak.

214
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm afraid she can't hold on.

215
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,520
Can you let her go first

216
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
and pay me back slowly?

217
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,960
What do you mean by that?

218
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,400
General Wang,

219
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,160
for the sake of our past,

220
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,080
What's the relationship between us?

221
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
Then you and Dongmei

222
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,880
are old friends.

223
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,320
You're so unkind.

224
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,240
Jiang Song,

225
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,280
don't think that

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,920
you can pretend to be pitiful to me.

227
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm going to break the rules for you.

228
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
But I can only look for you.

229
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,800
You can look for the government,

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,960
the mountain master.

231
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,400
Why do you have to look for me?

232
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,480
But you are...

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
You're just relying on

234
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
the fact that I once liked you.

235
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
You chose to leave.

236
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,720
We are strangers.

237
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,200
You should have heard that

238
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm going to get married soon.

239
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,800
Or you want to come and be my concubine?

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,560
Forget it.

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,280
I'm not like you.

242
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,960
I don't know how to be considerate.

243
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,640
Shen Que.

244
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,680
Do you know this person?

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,640
No.

246
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,840
No.

247
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,800
Is he Jiang Song?

248
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,160
I've seen many girls like you.

249
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,120
You're so red-eyed,

250
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,040
so hard-working,

251
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,600
and you're so passionate about men.

252
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,400
You say you're relying on yourself.

253
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,840
But in fact,

254
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,880
you're always relying on men.

255
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,640
My dear,

256
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,120
please pay attention to your words.

257
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,560
Don't call me that.

258
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm a soldier.

259
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm not like you.

260
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,400
I'm a sharp-knife,

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,480
and I'm quick-witted.

262
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm not like you.

263
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
You're so hard-working

264
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,760
for the sake of the little devil.

265
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,880
You're so cunning and cunning.

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,800
My dear,

267
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
isn't every woman

268
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
as lucky as you?

269
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,680
They don't choose

270
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,360
what kind of life they live.

271
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,040
Why are you so harsh?

272
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,840
You're so generous,

273
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,080
so quiet,

274
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,000
so kind,

275
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,600
and so generous.

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,840
Who can tell what kind of woman you are?

277
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,040
I don't think you're that kind.

278
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,520
You're talking too much.

279
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,800
Haven't you relied on men?

280
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,680
I have.

281
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
I've relied on men.

282
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,640
If necessary, I'll rely on men again.

283
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,600
That's good.

284
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,760
Haven't you relied on men?

285
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,840
When you're fighting in the battlefield,

286
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,360
you rely on your comrades' help.

287
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,680
I'm different from you.

288
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,120
I don't think there's any difference.

289
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,160
We should help each other

290
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,400
in the world.

291
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,840
No matter if he's a man or a woman,

292
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,640
there's not much

293
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,560
to leave for us.

294
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,800
It's stupid

295
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,680
to leave without a way.

296
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,240
You're so stubborn.

297
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,440
Let's go.

298
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,520
Cheng Yi is the fastest.

299
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,760
Where can I find a thousand taels?

300
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
We...

301
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,160
Let's go.

302
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,480
Yes.

303
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,960
The end of the world is coming.

304
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
You still want to play a small role?

305
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
So what?

306
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,480
As long as life goes on,

307
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,920
I won't give up every moment.

308
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
I have a way

309
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
to save Dongmei without any effort.

310
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,960
Do you want to try?

311
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,840
What's the way?

312
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
Don't you have

313
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,840
a novel that Jiang Jiaojiao left for you?

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,920
In the future,

315
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,280
Qin Sizhe will tie Jiang Jiaojiao up

316
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
at Guanyin Bridge

317
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,840
and give her to the black-haired Shentulong.

318
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,560
What's this?

319
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,240
Tell me.

320
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,000
Old rules.

321
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,920
Whoever wants to fight me

322
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,080
will lose.

323
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,640
You'll get such a big gold

324
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,680
and win.

325
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
The gold belongs to you.

326
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,560
The meat ticket

327
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
also belongs to you.

328
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,400
The Shentulong

329
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
used the meat ticket as bait

330
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,920
to make others challenge him.

331
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,200
He won every battle.

332
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I don't know how much he won.

333
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,440
Mr. Chu,

334
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,160
are you interested?

335
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm not a man who has many things to do.

336
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
Today's meat ticket

337
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
is a good treasure.

338
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,160
Look.

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
Such a beautiful beauty.

340
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,040
What?

341
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,280
No one saves her?

342
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,440
Yes.

343
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,080
Let me do it.

344
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,040
Bravo!

345
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,640
Chu Muzhi

346
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
is He Fang's master again.

347
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,240
The other pursuer of the heroine

348
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
is the heir of the top money shop in the world.

349
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,080
Look.

350
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,520
It's great to be Jiang Jiaojiao.

351
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,880
What should I do?

352
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,000
Wait at Guanyin Bridge.

353
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,800
Everything will be recommended by the story.

354
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,280
You can get in.

355
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
Do you have any other choice?

356
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,760
A thousand.

357
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
You have never seen

358
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,040
so much money in your life.

359
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,040
Since Shen Que and Cui Youan

360
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,080
can't rely on it,

361
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
we finally got a new teammate

362
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
and I can't pick one up soon.

363
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Didn't you say

364
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,440
L Ohio man's reputation is great?

365
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Why are you hesitating?

366
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,480
What are you thinking of really?

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,200
D今回请思归

368
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,200
Could that Qingsi Slayer

369
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,680
exist?

370
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,240
That was that year...

371
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,920
The

372
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
The

373
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
The

374
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
The

375
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
The

376
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
The

377
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
The

378
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
The

379
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
The

380
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
The

381
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
The

382
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
The

383
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
