00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Is it finally over?

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Come on.

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Jiang Song.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hold me tight.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Survive.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Survive for yourself.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hold me tight.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Jiang Jiang Jiang.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Jiang Jiang Jiang.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't give up.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Jiang Jiang Jiang.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're awake.

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hurry.

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Great.

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Inform the people in the guest room to come to the room.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll tell you my story.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mom always said she didn't have a bias.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But she didn't know

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
sometimes the child

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
could see more clearly than adults.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She became fond of cooking for her brother.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But she thought I didn't eat carrots

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
because I was picky.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But mom,

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm not picky.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I just don't eat carrots.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm not picky.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm not picky.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not picky.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just don't eat carrots.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As for dad,

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
as long as I'm obedient,

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
he just needs my unconditional

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
clothes to respect him.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I think you're pretty, too.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're so pretty.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think you're very handsome, too.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tong...

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's talk over there.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No one can see me.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm so jealous.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't need physical violence.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Just a look,

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
a few words,

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and that's enough.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm like an NPC.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The meaning of existence

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
is the passer-by

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
who is the protagonist.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My life,

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
speaking of,

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I've never experienced great hardship.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But is my pain

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
not worth mentioning?

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because I'm ordinary,

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
lonely,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
sensitive,

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and my voice

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is not worth listening to?

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is it because I'm not good enough?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I was like this.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is me.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I want to live another life.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to be a heroine, too.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I want to be seen.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You said I would show my feelings

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
in the novel I wrote.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You hoped my heroine

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
could bring me happiness.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
After jumping off the cliff,

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I thought I had crossed the world I wanted.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I didn't expect

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it was just a huge problem

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
that others had created for me.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In the world of novels,

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can walk on my own.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But in the real world,

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I dare not.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why are you so brave?

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Because I love myself.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I know myself.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I know what I want

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and what I like.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have no fear.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So I'm brave.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's great.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Since I was a child,

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've been only concerned

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
about getting other people's approval

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and attention.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I never thought about

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
what I wanted.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why do you look at yourself

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
through other people's eyes?

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Can those people's perspective

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
become real you?

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You are your audience

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and your heroine.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They should have been in my shoes

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
if they had been in my script.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you, Jiang Song.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Come with me to the real world.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's the difference between

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the real world and the imperfect world?

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
As long as I believe,

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
everything is real.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are right.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Believe is real.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The wind and rain are still strong.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But this time,

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the people I will become

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
will catch me.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Goodbye.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Goodbye.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Goodbye.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Goodbye.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Goodbye.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Goodbye.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Goodbye.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Goodbye.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Goodbye.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Goodbye.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Goodbye.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Goodbye.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Goodbye.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Take care.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Excuse me.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Qianqian?

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My wife.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You know me?

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Excuse me.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What year is it now?

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's five years since Chengpin.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Five years have passed.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The world is not in the middle of the world.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Die?

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Great.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I also want to travel alone.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But now,

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I just finished the exam.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't leave the capital for the time being.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's good to stay in the capital.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
My wife.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Excuse me.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you know

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
General Shen Que?

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Who doesn't know General Shen?

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Excuse me.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Excuse me.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Are you okay?

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm fine.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is your wife a friend of General Shen?

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
When the moonlight falls on the ground,

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
there is no silence.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
One day,

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you will leave your world.

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There are storms and wind and frost outside.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's hard to walk on the narrow road.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's not good to see the light.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But please remember,

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there is nothing worth your head.

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There is nothing.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't be afraid.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't be anxious.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Just go.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Stop if you want to.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Because the best scenery

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
is actually

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
your eyes.

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Shen Que.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Professor.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Professor.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Professor.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The clouds are in the clouds.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The wind is in the wind.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The wind is in the wind.

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Who knows the heart's desire?

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
She's gone.

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This time,

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't find her.

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Only with this book,

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I can feel

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
the little connection with her.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The memories of the past.

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I put her on my chest every night.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The memories of the past.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
As long as I'm alive,

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I hope she can hear my heartbeat

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
in a corner of the world

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and find the way back.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The End

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The End
