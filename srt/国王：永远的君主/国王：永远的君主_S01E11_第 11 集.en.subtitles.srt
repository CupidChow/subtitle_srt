ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,568
EPISODE 11

4
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,058
Who are you people?

5
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,270
You're not cops.

6
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,856
You seem like bad guys.

7
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,441
What do you do?

8
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,986
We helped you escape from the cops.

9
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,535
So I guess I can say that we're allies.

10
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,584
I heard you're famous in the slums.

11
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,837
You can and will do anything for money.

12
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,464
You don't have a home or a family.

13
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,717
You sleep curled up in your car

14
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,969
and run errands for others
to make a living.

15
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,015
You live in the gutter
not knowing what your parents look like.

16
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,269
And you're dying soon?

17
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,481
Don't you think life is too cruel?

18
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,528
Will it ever be your turn
to receive the organ transplant?

19
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,823
You just...

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,244
hurt my feelings.

21
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,541
I may use people's weaknesses,
but I never poke others' wounds.

22
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,752
You're a douchebag.

23
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,464
I refuse to be your ally.

24
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,178
I always meet the right people.

25
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,600
Were you praying?

26
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,986
JEONG TAE-EUL

27
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,655
What is this?

28
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,452
You went to the trouble of photoshopping
my face to bullshit me?

29
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,079
This girl is you.

30
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,873
You in the other world, to be exact.

31
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,919
However,
her life is very different from yours.

32
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,173
She grew up healthy and happy

33
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,092
with loving parents.

34
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,521
These are your parents

35
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,649
that you've never seen them before.

36
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,033
You're not that bitch I saw
in front of KU.

37
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,661
Do you have a twin sister?

38
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,707
I'll give you a new life.

39
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,668
Just nod if you want

40
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,795
that life.

41
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,717
Fortune has arrived knocking at your door.

42
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,641
How nice.

43
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,564
She had everything.

44
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,317
This pisses me off.

45
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,365
I'm actually hurt.

46
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,625
Prince Buyeong, who's known
as Professor Lee Jong-in,

47
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,003
was found dead
in his residence last night.

48
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,882
The Royal Court hasn't announced
the exact cause of death.

49
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,302
The police and prosecution have stated

50
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,764
that King Lee Gon has full authority
over all matters about the case

51
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,184
and that he'll investigate the cause
of death himself.

52
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:10,411
I return to Amitabha

53
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,666
Who guides me to the pure land

54
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:23,383
I return to the two bodhisattvas

55
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:29,013
On his left and right

56
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:35,436
I return...

57
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,498
Happy New Year, Your Majesty.

58
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,631
We are gathered here to wish the deceased

59
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,091
A good rebirth

60
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,052
And the earliest opportunity

61
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,930
To attain Nirvana

62
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,225
Led by King Lee Gon

63
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,437
Of the Kingdom of Corea

64
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,232
This funeral for Prince Buyeong
A royal relative...

65
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,442
Prime Minister Koo.

66
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,112
You smiled just now.

67
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,614
I did?

68
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:36,747
Rest in peace and attain Nirvana

69
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,005
I quite enjoy seeing Lee Gon

70
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,090
in despair.

71
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,617
Prime Minister Koo,
KU Group's chief secretary stopped by.

72
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,784
Two hours ago.

73
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,787
I was told to make sure
you get this today.

74
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,955
Just leave it there.

75
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,208
I'll take a quick break,
so don't disturb me.

76
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,667
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,477
Aren't my secretaries so capable?

78
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,088
The customer who left the umbrella
came to get it a few days ago.

79
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,217
He looked just like Lee Lim
when he was alive.

80
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,221
So I thought maybe he had a son.

81
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,934
So, Mom was right?

82
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,899
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

83
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,282
What's the connection

84
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,701
between these two?

85
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,834
I sent the 2G phone to myself
via registered mail before I came here.

86
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,795
If the recipient can't be reached,

87
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,007
they'll keep it at the post office
after two delivery attempts.

88
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,634
They're probably still trying.

89
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,973
Are you going to get me out now?

90
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,018
Of course, I'll get you out.

91
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,580
Corpses are removed immediately.

92
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,849
Are you looking for something specific?

93
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,023
If your skin is on the dry side,
would you like to try this?

94
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,025
Now?

95
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,736
It's very dry outside, isn't it?

96
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,239
This is Golden Time Mist Ampoule.
Please close your eyes.

97
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,658
I'll try it myself.

98
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,913
Spray it right after washing your face,
and it'll hydrate--

99
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,250
Hey, Jangmi. She's on your left.

100
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,253
-Her outfit matches yours.
-Okay, got it.

101
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
Move along. No photos, please!

102
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,030
Did you just abduct her?

103
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,950
No, we arrested her.

104
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,244
Oh, right.

105
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,371
We're cops.

106
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,041
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks for your cooperation.

107
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,047
And for this too.
It is very hydrating indeed.

108
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,210
The Royal Wardrobe sent your clothes
for the New Year's ceremony.

109
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,214
I thought I should drop it off myself
so that I could see you.

110
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,800
Oh, is today that day?

111
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,721
The day when Prime Minister Koo
stays up all night with His Majesty?

112
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,850
You obviously came here
because it makes you uneasy.

113
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,562
Because of that wench, Koo Seo-ryeong?

114
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,564
Gosh, of course not.

115
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,358
I'm glad you're here.

116
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,445
I knew it was around this time,
so I was waiting for you.

117
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,699
The gamhongro has aged very well.

118
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,460
Has His Majesty left the study?

119
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,464
Yes, just in time on Thursday night.

120
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,219
Prime Minister Koo is pretty,

121
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,222
but she has no other good qualities.

122
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,890
She is sly and vulpine.

123
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,478
And if you look at her closely,
she's not even that pretty.

124
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,356
I know.

125
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,650
I understand.

126
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,764
She doesn't have any health problems.

127
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,060
We gave her a tranquilizer
along with vitamin infusions.

128
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,731
And Dr. Hwang said

129
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,360
he'll return to the palace as soon as
Prince Buyeong's autopsy is done.

130
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,589
I love you.

131
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,846
I am deeply...

132
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,477
in love with you.

133
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,099
I could tell

134
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,814
that he was not from a different world,
but from a different time.

135
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,444
Perhaps,

136
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,197
that was the day when I made up my mind

137
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,701
about a lot of things.

138
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,593
Am I getting dumped like this?

139
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,724
No way. I'll show you once you're back.

140
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,921
FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

141
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,715
Hey, it's me.

142
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,717
Did you hear?

143
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,471
Jang Yeon-ji committed suicide
at the penitentiary.

144
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,515
-Suicide?
-Yes.

145
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,768
I just got a call
from Seongdong-gu's forensics team.

146
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,311
Hold on.

147
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,939
Jang Yeon-ji took her own life.

148
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,317
Hey, go on.

149
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,196
But there was a power outage that day,
so there's no CCTV footage.

150
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,659
You didn't harass or mistreat her
when you were there, right?

151
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,869
I heard you visited her.

152
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,207
Suicides are rare at penitentiaries,
you know.

153
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,962
They might investigate you
for use of force, so be careful.

154
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,798
Okay. Thanks, Gyeong-ran. I have to go.

155
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,556
They got rid of her to cut the tail off.
Let's go.

156
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,685
Go where?
It's not even within our jurisdiction.

157
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,646
Not there.
Let's find Song Jeong-hye first.

158
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,816
The cinerarium may have
her contact info as the guardian.

159
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,652
Who is Song Jeong-hye?

160
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,946
Lee Ji-hun's mother.

161
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,782
The cinerarium you went to. That boy.

162
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,535
But if she's Lee Ji-hun's mom...

163
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,872
Right.
She looks exactly like Lee Gon's mother,

164
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,458
which means
she's most likely with Lee Lim now.

165
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,795
The address is useless.
I went and only saw farmland.

166
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,672
Just a moment.

167
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,633
It's the management office. Hello?

168
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,430
-Are you the one who called?
-Yes, I am.

169
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,183
I'm Lieutenant Jeong of Jongno.

170
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,227
I see. I looked into what you asked about,

171
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,605
but we have no contact info on file
for Lee Ji-hun.

172
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,817
We've been receiving
five years' worth of payments up front.

173
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,819
Always in cash.

174
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,448
I never thought of that.

175
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,368
Then could we check
your security camera footage?

176
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,163
Not this place.
Just the ones from your parking lot.

177
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,248
-We'll be there.
-Okay, see you there.

178
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,297
We need the footage from here.
We don't know what she looks like.

179
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,716
I do.

180
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,485
By the way, who is Lee Lim?

181
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,990
The instigator behind it all.

182
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,409
And I think...

183
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,790
he's the one who brought you here.

184
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,444
This was in the pocket.

185
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,948
I didn't come for that. You can keep it.

186
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,244
Use it to protect what belongs to you.

187
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,709
You know where my car is, right?

188
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,254
You can have that too.
And everything inside the car.

189
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,925
All I ask for in return is
that you feed Luna.

190
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,303
Going off to steal again?

191
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:49,891
Do you believe...

192
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,729
God exists?

193
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,358
Then I'll be punished.

194
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,116
By the way, that yo-yo...

195
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,452
Why is the string red?

196
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,956
I hooked it up myself.

197
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,418
Who taught you that expression?

198
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,297
Hook it up again. It might break.

199
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,715
Bye.

200
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,717
All right, bye.

201
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
He practically disowned his son

202
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,149
and devoted his life to the Royal Court.

203
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,527
A member of the royal family wore this?

204
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,616
And look at these furniture pieces.
Goodness.

205
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,786
Did you read the article today?

206
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,622
"Passed away at 76,

207
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,585
a righteous, humble life
devoted to the nation and Royal Court."

208
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,464
"Righteous"? Sure.

209
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,801
But why did the word, "humble,"
have to go in there?

210
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,888
You folks worked him like a dog
until he was almost 80.

211
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,515
"Humble"?

212
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,267
He was just used.

213
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,270
My father was used.

214
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,691
It's New Year's Day. We'll visit you.

215
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,735
Se-jin misses you a lot.

216
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,613
Just send Se-jin, then.
You cannot come here.

217
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,033
You cannot set foot
in the Kingdom of Corea.

218
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,160
Dad, why are you being like this?

219
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,373
We follow the rule of primogeniture,
so I'll be next in line when you're gone.

220
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,419
Will you seriously let all that money
fall into Gon's lap?

221
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,711
Let me say this again.

222
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,173
I cannot let you come
anywhere near the Royal Court,

223
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,426
no matter what. I have to go.

224
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,764
I can move into this house, right?

225
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,392
I'm selling my house in LA.

226
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,354
I'll also close my clinic
as soon as my return date is set.

227
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,524
I should take over
the royal physician role

228
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,527
and manage the foundation as well.

229
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,991
You should announce the new director

230
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,368
and the order of succession
on the same day.

231
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,664
Seung-heon.

232
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,167
Yes, Your Majesty.

233
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,423
You cannot enter the Kingdom of Corea.

234
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,137
-Your Majesty--
-And you won't succeed the throne.

235
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,308
Se-jin is next in line to the throne.

236
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,642
Nonsense.

237
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,519
Says who?

238
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:43,190
You must leave immediately
after the 49th-day memorial service.

239
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,319
I will let you maintain your dignity
as a member of the Royal Family.

240
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,653
Gon, how dare you...

241
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,823
-Hey--
-Is anybody outside?

242
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,413
I want a report on every move

243
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,334
of Prince Buyeong's eldest son
until the 49th-day memorial service.

244
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,086
And he shall leave the country

245
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,882
as soon as the service is over.

246
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,258
-Yes!
-Yes!

247
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,306
Wait, Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

248
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,475
Hey, step aside! Move!

249
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,769
Please spare me a second. Your Majesty!

250
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,954
Your Majesty.

251
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,459
I suppose

252
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,963
the autopsy is done.

253
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,432
I'm ready to listen.

254
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,314
The cause of death was asphyxiation
caused by strangulation,

255
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,192
and strong force applied to the neck.

256
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,200
This was found on the corpse.

257
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,454
It seems someone put it
on his finger after he died.

258
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,458
Also, no hesitation wounds were found
on the Royal Guards who were killed.

259
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,003
They were slain in one blow
with a sharp blade.

260
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,017
Lee Lim will not hide,

261
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,770
and he does not intend to hide anything.
He is...

262
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,816
calling me to stand on my father's blood.

263
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,028
He is provoking me using my uncle's blood.

264
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,363
Lee Lim.

265
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,026
My gosh! Your Majesty.

266
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,320
When did he get here?

267
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,489
No idea. He startled me.

268
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,240
Your Majesty, in the garden...

269
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,327
My apologies.
I was distracted for a moment.

270
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,328
Sub-captain Seok.

271
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,413
I'll be away.

272
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,167
I'll try to come back soon,
but it may take a while.

273
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,545
You won't be able to reach me.
Officially, I'm in the study--

274
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,463
Your Majesty.

275
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,676
You need to see this.

276
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,348
This news has been circulating
since this afternoon.

277
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,559
These were released all at once.

278
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,895
This is intentional, Your Majesty.

279
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,147
Prime Minister Koo

280
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,275
has pulled the gag.

281
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,486
She wants to tie me down.

282
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,156
-Call her office now.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,414
This is the Royal Court.
The King is asking for her.

284
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,750
A sick day?

285
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,961
Prime Minister Koo?

286
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,130
Anyway, okay.

287
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,882
-Your Majesty.
-I heard.

288
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,594
Find her and put her on the phone.

289
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,512
Yes.

290
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,852
Sub-captain Seok.

291
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,064
Bring me the daily log of the team
that guarded Prince Buyeong.

292
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,108
For the past six months.

293
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,901
Yes, Your Majesty!

294
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,909
The evening pills contain
a sleep inducer, so take them on time.

295
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,719
Who are you?

296
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,137
Why are you tailing me?

297
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,973
I bet this isn't the first time.

298
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,310
Pick it up.

299
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,520
That will be best for both of us.

300
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,695
All right, well done.

301
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,618
Now, listen up.

302
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,621
That broken bottle makes this
special violence.

303
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,373
And you're holding my wallet,
so this is also robbery.

304
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,001
See this blood?
Infliction of bodily injury.

305
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,713
So, everything I do from this moment on
will be execution of duties.

306
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,560
Goddamnit.

307
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,785
Oh, right. I'm not supposed to kill you.

308
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,046
Who told you not to kill me?

309
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,715
I should thank that person.

310
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,552
Just someone…

311
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,180
always by your side.

312
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,392
Who are you, really?

313
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,562
If you let me go now,

314
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,314
this phone will ring.

315
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,149
But if you arrest me,

316
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,944
this phone won't ring.

317
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:04,946
Forever.

318
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,119
I'm just curious.

319
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,289
Who pays the phone bill?

320
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,837
You can't catch me anyway.

321
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,683
031G 7370

322
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,979
031G 7370

323
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:54,203
Now, describe the process of the arrest.
Write down when and how it was done.

324
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,663
Okay.

325
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,293
On January 30, we staked out
a skincare store near Jongno Station.

326
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,630
Lieutenant Jeong sprayed facial mist
with her eyes open.

327
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,631
Jangmi.

328
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,888
Lieutenant Jeong
bravely sprayed facial mist--

329
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,805
Jangmi?

330
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,101
Sin-jae! What happened?

331
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,227
Sin-jae!

332
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,687
Gosh!

333
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,649
Come and sit here.

334
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,195
-What happened?
-What kind of bastard...

335
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,615
Tell me. I will destroy that bastard.

336
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,576
I'll bring the car over.
Dress the wound and come outside.

337
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,494
Okay.

338
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,997
You should've gone to the hospital.
Why come here?

339
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,540
Don't make me talk. It hurts.

340
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,751
Take this.

341
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,546
Dust it for prints.

342
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,383
You can disregard mine though.

343
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,678
This is...

344
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,805
Yes, what they have in common.

345
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,391
It came to me as well.

346
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,022
Aren't we going to the hospital?
Let's go. This hurts a lot.

347
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,482
Gosh, seriously.

348
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,777
-Jangmi, hurry.
-Yes! I'm on my way!

349
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,072
I got the direction wrong.

350
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,074
I dodged to the right instead of left.

351
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,457
Don't call my mom.

352
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,129
And don't tell Chief Park.
That guy, Jo Yeong, too.

353
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,588
Just don't tell anyone.

354
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,092
Come on. Jangmi knows.

355
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:32,927
Oh, right.

356
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,180
You look more injured.

357
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,186
What happened?

358
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,398
What do you mean the phone came to you?

359
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,776
It must be that bastard.

360
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,279
The one who brought me here. Lee Lim.

361
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,115
He sent me someone.

362
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,119
That man said the phone will ring.

363
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,081
I wonder why they approached me.

364
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,917
Will I really get a call?

365
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,297
Suggest meeting up to discuss the details.

366
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,591
And tell him to bring
his prettiest friend.

367
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,342
Let's catch them all at once.

368
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,558
What are we after?
And where are we headed?

369
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,106
I don't have the exact answer to that yet.

370
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,609
So I'll just keep going.

371
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,488
I was told that we'll arrive somewhere
if we keep going.

372
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,407
If we walk far enough, that is.

373
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,203
-Who said that?
-Alice in Wonderland.

374
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,040
I think you're bullshitting me,
but I didn't read it.

375
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,793
Gosh, this hurts.

I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

378
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,989
I cannot get a hold of Prime Minister Koo.

379
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,492
She hasn't left her residence,

380
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,703
and she's having all reports
sent to her electronically.

381
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,873
Should I send someone?

382
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,544
No, there is no need.

383
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,382
She's trying to get back at me
by doing exactly what I did.

384
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,350
It seems like she's trying
to go somewhere with this,

385
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,310
so we shall wait.

BUSAN, THE SLUMS, EOSU BOOKSTORE

388
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,882
"The slums,

389
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,634
Eosu Bookstore."

390
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,724
It's the only place he visited in Busan.

391
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,397
What could this mean?

392
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,650
This move Uncle Buyeong made…

393
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,403
I'll look into it right now.

394
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,452
The footsteps you take

395
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:50,666
by risking your whole life is what's fate.

396
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,711
He knew I'd check the daily log.

397
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,308
Team One, get armed and follow me.

398
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,392
Yes, Your Majesty!

399
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,146
Team One,
be armed and get ready immediately.

400
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,117
I'm asking you this to save lives,
not because I don't know.

401
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,578
Do you know Eosu Bookstore?

402
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,456
The one who answers first will live.

403
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,874
If you stay silent,

404
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,418
you will be beheaded.

405
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,213
I do not know.
I really don't know anything.

406
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,215
I've never even been to a bookstore.

407
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,676
You can't kill me

408
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,889
because you need to interrogate me
to reach Prince Imperial Geum.

409
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,602
I don't care what you know

410
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,605
because that information
won't help me reach Lee Lim.

411
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,651
You obviously only know
what can be spilled.

412
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,330
And most importantly,

413
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,085
I no longer want
any information from you.

414
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,717
Then pull the trigger. Do it!

415
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,137
Go ahead and kill me if you think you can!

416
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,393
Yes, I will kill you.

417
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,437
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

418
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,689
They lied to me about this place.

419
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,109
I want to go back.
I'll go back, Your Majesty!

420
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,279
It's too late.
You're already dead in that world.

421
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,826
You committed the crime yourself,
so I'm sure you know it well.

422
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,455
You two have caused chaos in both worlds.

423
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,042
You will pay for what you did here.

424
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,211
Your Majesty. Spare my life.

425
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,588
Please spare me!

426
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,882
Spare me, Your Majesty. Please!

427
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,718
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

428
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,889
You'll behead me? Bullshit.

429
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,976
Beheading was abolished ages ago
in the Kingdom of Corea!

430
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,985
You forgot
because you're a traitor's henchman.

431
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,530
The king's words

432
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,408
are the law.

433
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,621
Royal Guards.

434
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,500
Kim Gi-hwan, the traitor's henchman
who chose silence…

435
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,420
shall be beheaded.

436
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,839
It's the king's order.

437
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,061
Breaking news.

438
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,271
The Royal Court's spokesperson announced

439
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,316
that Kim Gi-hwan, a traitor's follower,
has been arrested.

440
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,903
-The spokesperson also stated
-My gosh.

441
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,948
-that Kim will be beheaded according to
-That's ruthless.

442
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,032
the special law.

443
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,745
This means that he will be executed
according to the Criminal Act.

444
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,289
The execution will take place
at midnight tonight.

445
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:21,752
This law has never been put to use before
since King Lee Gon's enthronement.

446
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,255
It is being used
for the first time in 62 years.

447
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,560
Did you make steak and rice
for Seo-ryeong or not?

448
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,813
You didn't prepare
the rice in that uniform, did you?

449
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,569
I rinsed the rice,
and then put on the uniform.

450
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,406
And what did you say?

451
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,909
You put it on
"at the most honorable moment"?

452
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,412
It's true.

453
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,875
The moment I propose
to the love of my life, for example.

454
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,836
You didn't wear it for me.

455
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,464
I couldn't. I was in a hurry.

456
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,635
It's the best thing I've done
since coming to this world.

457
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,848
I'm waiting for your answer,
and the story earlier was a joke.

458
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,434
You call that a proposal?

459
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,438
You never asked me to be your queen.
You just told me to do it.

460
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,907
So what's your answer? Will you do it?

461
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,959
I'm going to punch you.

462
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,259
Will you do it?

463
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,765
If I say no,

464
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,310
will I never see you again?

465
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,315
So, it's a no?

466
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,236
Not today.

467
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,868
I've been thinking.

468
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,748
I'm just going to live for today
and not think about anything else.

469
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,836
As if today is the only ordinary day
where we're allowed to be scandalous.

470
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,464
That's what we should do.

471
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,758
Let's just do that.

472
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,137
In moments like this,

473
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,391
couples pledge their eternal love.

474
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,811
But we'll only live for today?

475
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,357
That's right. There's no tomorrow for us.

476
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,196
That's why I'm hoping today is a long day.

477
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,912
That's why I'm holding your hand.
Because we'll only live today.

478
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,713
And yet we'll only hold hands
and do nothing else?

479
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,258
Do you know what "scandalous" means?

480
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,013
You ditched me
even when we were alone at your palace.

481
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,893
You should have asked me to stay.
I was being considerate of you.

482
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,981
Next time, I won't be so considerate.

483
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,694
There's no next time.
I told you that we'll only live for today.

484
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,530
Gosh, where do I even start with you?

485
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,533
Hey.

486
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,243
Stop.

487
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,662
Have patience with me.

488
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,748
I'm a fast learner.

489
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,375
I know you can hear me.

490
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,377
Hey.

491
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,483
Excuse me!

492
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,736
Excuse me.

493
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,240
Yes, can I help you?

494
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,870
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo-ryeong,
the prime minister of the Kingdom.

495
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:31,919
Sorry to bother you.

496
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,755
I'll have to check your ID.
I'm a police officer.

497
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:40,052
Don't the police usually show
their badges first?

498
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,975
You look more like a criminal than a cop.

499
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,152
Yes. I'm Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
from Jongno.

500
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,240
You really are a cop.

501
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,832
This has never happened to me before.

July 26, 1982.

505
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,513
Did I do something wrong?

506
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,641
No, it's fine.

507
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,435
You may move along.

508
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,482
I don't even know why I got so nervous.

509
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,151
Bye now.

510
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,629
I'll take these,
and could you throw those out?

511
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,547
Sure.

00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,195
Hi, Dad.

515
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,698
I'm on my way now.
I'll meet you at the store.

516
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:57,397
What's the mushroom that forms liquid
when you grill?

517
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,398
Pine mushrooms?

518
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,944
-These are king oyster mushrooms.
-Hey, hold on.

519
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,988
This is great for boosting your stamina.

520

There. Go.

521
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,409
-Dad, seriously!
-What?

522
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,829
We'll eat pork.
Why do you buy chicken?

523
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,705
We can eat this tomorrow.

524
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,457
Hey, can't you just splurge?

525
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,708
-Goodness.
-Put it down.

526
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,872
Hello, welcome.

527
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,045
Can I see the menu?
It's my first time here.

528
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,672
Here you go.

529
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,508
Hey, you.

00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,984
57247093699959574966967627

531
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,696
72407663033547594571382179

532
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,198
So, it's 3,481 seconds.

533
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,162
I missed the beginning,
but the second time...

534
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,664
She thinks you left again--

535
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,375
For 121 seconds.

536
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,711
Then for 841 seconds.

537
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,422
And 961 seconds.

538
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,924
Then 2,209 seconds.

539
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,218
And lastly...

540
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:43,331
The amount of frozen time is multiplying
by the square root of the prime number.

541
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:49,838
At this rate, time will stop
for a whole day the 62nd time it happens.

542
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,342
In other words, there will come a moment

543
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,014
when the worlds, both Tae-eul's and mine,
will stop forever.

544
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,393
Your Majesty.

545
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,646
We've found where Eosu Bookstore is.

546
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,482
This prick is the owner.

547
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,033
He's alive?

548
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,120
Tell me what to do.

549
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,081
How dare you...

550
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,373
Your Highness!

551
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,469
He was alive this whole time.

552
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,690
EOSU BOOKSTORE

553
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,616
Tonight,

554
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,162
we will raid Eosu Bookstore,
the hideout of the traitor's followers.

555
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,967
Everything is clear.
Should we capture them alive?

556
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,478
Kill them.

557
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,282
Why do I keep getting the same thing?

558
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:49,958
There you are.

559
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,751
Come to daddy.

560
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,149
Damn it.

561
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,566
The bookstore?

562
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,693
Me?

563
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,613
Why? Is that prick acting up?

564
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,698
He's no longer useful.

565
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,452
I need you to take care of that bookstore.

566
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,791
See? I told you.
I don't have to take anything, right?

567
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,961
When should I go?
What do I do when I'm there?

568
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,683
This is why I said...

569
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,607
you never know
what someone is really thinking.

570
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,686
Check his left shoulder
for a gunshot wound.

571
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,282
There's nothing.

572
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:01,983
Eight.

573
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:05,820
Car keys.

574
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,281
Those with the same faces

575
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,243
are stealing lives…

576
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,288
of their counterparts.

577
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,712
Sub-captain Seok.

578
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:10,343
Retreat immediately
and assemble all Royal Guards.

579
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:15,306
The infantry unit and cavalry unit
are to be on standby, fully armed.

580
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,856
Hang in there just a little longer,
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

581
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,774
I'm coming for you.

582
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,445
I will find you no matter what.

583
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:32,031
Please just be there,
no matter where you are.

584
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,214
What are you doing here, kiddo?

585
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,592
Get out of here.

586
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,927
I warn people of danger

587
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,096
and defeat the enemy.

588
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:56,931
What?

589
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,398
By the way,

590
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,110
you're in this world too.

591
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:13,698
There's only one of me.
I went to the other world.

592
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,424
I'm restoring balance.

593
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,635
There are too many enemies.

594
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:43,937
You...

595
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,397
What is going on?

596
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,567
Who are you?

597
00:58:58,952 --> 00:58:59,786
Run!

598
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,664
She's up! Get her!

599
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,123
-You little...
-Get her!

600
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,103
Shit, my phone.

601
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,607
How do I get to Seoul?

602
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,152
BUSAN PALACE

603
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,030
What?

604
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:18,823
"Busan Palace"?

605
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,453
Am I in the Kingdom now?

606
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,296
The bookstore...

607
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,133
Even the ones inside the building
were shot to death.

608
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,227
I thought he was a benevolent ruler.

609
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,398
Who knew my nephew could be
such a blood-thirsty tyrant?

610
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,405
We lost the woman. I sincerely apologize.

611
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,742
We are chasing her, so--

612
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,836
She must be headed to the main palace.
Catch her.

613
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,007
Gon will come even for her corpse,

614
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,135
so bring her to me dead or alive

615
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,139
I must obtain something
in exchange for her!

616
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,225
-Yes, Your Highness!
-Yes, Your Highness!

617
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,258
CALL THIS NUMBER
TO WISH HIS MAJESTY A HAPPY NEW YEAR

618
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:20,022
Wish the king of the Kingdom of Corea
a happy new year after the tone.

619
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,276
Gon.

620
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,864
It's me, Jeong Tae-eul.

621
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,702
You won't believe me,

622
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,955
but I'm in the Kingdom of Corea now.

623
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,959
I'm being chased by someone.

624
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,129
I'm headed

625
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,548
to the palace now.

626
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:47,884
I'll hurry.

627
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,344
I'm on my way there now--

628
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:51,846
Message recorded.

629
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,931
Thank you for using our service.

630
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,684
So look for me

631
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,979
when you get this message.

632
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,027
Protect her!

633
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:37,154
She is the future queen.

634
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,740
She's the woman I love.

635
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:29,493
Why are cracks appearing?

636
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,953
Just kill me!

637
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,956
We each have a piece
of something we both want.

638
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,457
What is your real name?

639
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,586
-A déjà vu?
-I saw myself just now.

640
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,754
Na-ri!

641
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,756
Why would you mistake me for someone else?

642
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,342
So if you lose it, the door closes.

643
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,927
If that door closes...

644
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,971
I think it was fate.

645
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,390
I'll open all the doors in the universe.
