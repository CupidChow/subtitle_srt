PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 8

4
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,244
Am I really not in your world?

5
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,871
JEONG TAE-EUL

6
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,290
I was going to tell you when I was sure,

7
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,795
but I think there is someone
with your face in my world.

8
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,923
Same faces,

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,466
same ID card,

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,426
and parallel worlds.

11
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:38,640
I should've known that day
when I was wondering

12
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,142
where my ID card went.

13
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,352
GUEST ROOM USER

14
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,398
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

15
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,875
Your Highness,
that does not belong to this world.

16
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,253
Things got entangled strangely.

17
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,798
I did not make this move.

18
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,259
That girl is very famous in this world.

19
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,844
Her name is Luna.

20
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,848
If you pay her, she finds people
and even steals things for you.

21
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,516
She does everything for money.

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,435
I need you to track down
and bring her to me.

23
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,021
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,274
Then...

25
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,736
will I be able to catch up with you?

26
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,572
JEONG TAE-EUL

27
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,906
That Lee Lim is alive

28
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,785
and the two worlds are getting mixed up.

29
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,038
At least at the moment
when I sensed the transcendental power

30
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,166
that was trying to restore balance...

31
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,919
I should've known
before we had to face this situation.

32
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,716
That it's something like fate,
so to speak.

33
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,307
Goodness, it's good to see you.

34
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,895
We keep meeting
at unexpected places, right?

35
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,113
This was my last cigarette.
What are you going to do?

36
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,994
You're talking to me all casually
just because we've met once.

37
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,875
As the Prime Minister,
I think you should quit.

38
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,085
Take your campaigning elsewhere.

39
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,296
I didn't vote for you.

40
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,256
You said you were my fan.

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,719
Are you being a stranger
because now I know who you are?

42
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,137
Cut the crap.

43
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,681
I do not recall meeting you.

44
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,353
You're really something.

45
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,901
It is you. At the KU Building.

46
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,237
The traveler.

47
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,197
Do you live in a fairy tale?

48
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,201
Is this your palace?

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,876
Ms. Civil Servant.

50
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,339
Those who talk to me
belong to one of these two categories.

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,926
They either stole something from me

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,178
or got something stolen by me.

53
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,683
It never ends well in either case.

54
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,560
Get out of my way.

55
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,900
You really don't know me?

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,826
If you touch me again,

57
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,328
I'll punch you without notice.

58
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,166
Does he know that you're an ex-con?

59
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,005
I'll also punch you
if you ask me these nonsensical questions.

60
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,011
So, you really

61
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,931
don't know me as well as him.

62
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,769
You're not that bitch I saw
in front of KU.

63
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,813
Do you have a twin sister?

64
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,483
Is that what they're saying?

65
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,904
You have access to enough intel
to figure out my release date,

66
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,074
so it's possible
that you know more about me than I do.

67
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,785
Let me know if you find her.

68
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,912
I'm curious too.

69
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,910
Go tell your mom
that you want to leave at once.

70
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:15,833
I'm going to kill that man over there
in a bit.

71
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,586
I'm just waiting for you to leave.

72
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,296
Why?

73
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,678
I had to serve jail time
because he betrayed me,

74
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,641
but he's here
to stuff his face with ice cream.

75
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,563
Min-jae, let's go.

76
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,458
You...

77
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,963
What are you doing here?
How the hell did you get out?

78
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,608
You see,

79
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,446
do you know what's good
about having nothing?

80
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,240
I have nothing to lose.

81
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,744
You have a pretty wife

82
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,415
and an ugly son, who looks just like you.

83
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,750
Don't hurt the kid. Please.

84
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,547
I'll give you back your money.
All of it. I'm serious.

85
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,215
I don't understand

86
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,429
why a jerk like you get married,
knowing it'd just be your weakness?

87
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,599
The insurance payout of 20 million won
and the interest as well.

88
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,017
I'll give it all back.

89
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,437
I must have lost my mind back then.

90
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,147
Please.

91
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,941
He's the apple of my eye.

92
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,445
-Please don't hurt him.
-The apple of your puny eye?

93
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,743
Get the money ready.
The bills with the king's face.

94
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,121
No funny business,

95
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,583
or your son will actually end up
in your eyes,

96
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,877
as ground-up flesh.

97
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,684
Detective?

98
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,771
Oh, hello.

99
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,566
I'm Lieutenant Jeong
from Jongno Police Station.

100
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,153
I'm the admin manager.

101
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,074
I heard you're looking for a patient
who was here in 1995.

102
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,495
Yes. He died here, at Yangsun Care Center.

103
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,038
His name is Lee Seong-jae.

104
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,376
All the records were handwritten in 1995.

105
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,877
They're all gone.

106
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,755
The system changed
more than three times since then.

107
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,259
We have records only date back
to ten years ago now.

108
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,179
Then do you know if any of your doctors,

109
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,682
nurses, or employees were here back then?

110
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,309
I've been here for 19 years.

111
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,813
Everyone who was here before me
is all retired now.

112
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,775
Except for me,
only the director was here back then.

113
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,736
Then may I meet the director?

114
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,906
The director would remember him.
He had poliomyelitis.

115
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,534
The director is rarely in Korea.

116
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:41,080
It's not like the director has to treat
patients. And with all that wealth...

117
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,749
If this is regarding a criminal case,

118
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,128
you must've brought an official document
or a warrant. What's this about?

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,259
I needed some information
for another case I'm working on.

120
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,427
Thanks for your help.

121
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,345
No problem.

122
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,231
Asking for a warrant first?

123
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:12,361
I can't tell if she's good at her job
or if she's done this many times before.

124
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,536
The picture of Prime Minister Koo
and the king is the talk of the town.

125
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,579
That's right.

126
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:25,875
A photo of them whispering to each other
at the racetrack was released.

127
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,712
Correct, but those in Yeouido
can't just brush this off

128
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,464
as a groundless rumor.

129
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,800
Right, Prime Minister Koo
has quite a background.

130
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,385
She's been on an elite path.

131
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,305
She went to SeojinÂ High School
and Corea University.

132
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,766
Then she joined a public channel
as an announcer

133
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,019
and became the main news anchor
in just four years.

134
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,190
Then she surprised everyone by marrying
the second son of the KU family.

135
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,234
My gosh. She surprised us once again
shortly after that.

136
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,904
She got a divorce in the same year.

137
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,657
That's right.
Scandals follow her everywhere she goes.

138
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,369
After her divorce, she got into politics.

139
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,829
She became Prime Minister in seven years.

140
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,206
...in just seven years.

141
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,209
-My gosh, it sounds like a movie.
-It sounds like a movie.

142
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,384
Mommy will take you to somewhere nice.

143
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,554
Sa-rang, you now have an aunt.

144
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,267
A prime minister aunt.

145
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,149
It's nice to meet you.

146
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,151
I'm a big fan.

147
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,155
This was my last cigarette.
What are you going to do?

148
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,242
Jeez, what's the deal
with that crazy bitch?

149
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,330
MOM

150
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,748
Hi, Mom.

151
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,085
I'm surprised you picked up right away.

152
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,170
Everything's good?

153
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,798
Things can't be good all the time.

154
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,426
I won't get paid
if everything is peaceful.

155
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,971
-What's up?
-I just wanted to call you.

156
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,683
I had a really weird dream last night.

157
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,479
I know you rarely drive yourself,
but drive safely if you do.

158
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,815
And be careful not to lose anything.

159
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,901
You always have the weirdest dreams, Mom.

160
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,154
Don't worry.

161
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,614
I'd never let anyone
take anything from me.

162
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,745
Oh, right.
Mom, what's the newspaper you sent me?

163
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,704
Newspaper?

164
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,289
What newspaper?

165
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,499
I didn't send anything like that.

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,084
You got something?

167
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,212
I'll call you later. I have a customer.

168
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,672
All right.

169
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,759
Hello.

170
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,182
What would you like? The mackerel
and Pacific saury are both fresh.

171
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,851
I left my umbrella here a long time ago.

172
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,187
Do you still have it?

173
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,482
Yes.

174
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,318
I thought you'd come back for it,
so I kept it.

175
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,613
That's why you looked familiar.

176
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,909
I thought I had seen you somewhere before.
Just a moment, please.

177
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,898
You got out early.

178
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,858
And your style has changed.

179
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,803
I just grabbed a random one on the run.

180
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,888
It's getting cold.

181
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,266
Put it on or you'll freeze to death.

182
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,393
Then why do you live in a van?

183
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,771
You steal stuff every day,
and you're still broke?

184
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,067
No, I have a lot of money.
But I also have a lot of enemies.

185
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,030
It's a world you don't need to know about.

186
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,180
Leave it anywhere there.

187
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,646
Thank you for this.

188
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,734
It's hot cocoa.

189
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,694
I heard you like sweets.

190
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,907
Chief Park says it when he drinks.

191
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:14,830
"Sin-jae loves sweets,
and Tae-eul is a meat lover.

192
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,375
Detective Shim loves makgeolli."

193
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,629
I heard the newbie likes macarons.

194
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,713
Macarons?

195
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,340
That's crazy.

196
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,845
It's Ms. Ha's autopsy results.

197
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,890
You're lucky that you know me.

198
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,808
Thank you.

199
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,310
Sure.

200
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm sure you saw it at the scene.

201
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,690
She bled to death
from the two neck wounds.

202
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,693
A small amount of zolpidem
was found in her blood.

203
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,196
It explains
why there are no defense wounds.

204
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,116
I was suspecting her boyfriend
because of the security footage,

205
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,160
but I should reinvestigate her roommate.

206
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,119
Yes, I agree.

207
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,456
I've also been suspicious
of my roommate as of late.

208
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,958
It's not you, right?

209
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,671
-Sorry?
-The one who keeps calling my hubby out.

210
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,926
You're his alibi, but I'm debating
whether or not I should look into it.

211
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,219
What should I do?

212
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,555
It is me.

213
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,474
-I did--
-Okay.

214
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,685
-Get going.
-Okay.

215
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,406
What did she say?

216
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,243
You've been taking off often.
Are you receiving bribes?

217
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,418
It's too bad that such a fine tradition
is disappearing these days.

218
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,757
A small amount of zolpidem was found.
She was sedated, then stabbed.

219
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,344
Then maybe it wasn't Park Jung-gu.

220
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,556
He fed her, sedated her, stabbed her,
and ran?

221
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,099
The time isn't enough.

222
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,935
It was Jang Yeon-ji.

223
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,817
Even if we arrest her,
we'll only have 48 hours.

224
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,279
Check her medical records
and find solid evidence to lock her up.

225
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,032
First, remove the boyfriend
from the suspect list.

226
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,743
Then what should you do?
Arrest him first, right?

227
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,619
Good luck.

228
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,372
Jangmi and I switched our stakeout shifts.

229
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,957
Why?

230
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,251
Why are you taking off?

231
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,635
-How can we help you?
-I'm here for Min Hwa-yeon.

232
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,517
Are you her son? All right, have a seat.

233
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,523
I need your signature here.

234
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,525
You know the drill.

235
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,696
Your mother said you're a cop.

236
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,031
AFFIDAVIT OF IDENTITY

237
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,621
Lieutenant Kang Sin-jae of Jongno.

238
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,499
So it's true.
I thought she was bullshitting.

239
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,127
You know this isn't her first time.

240
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,631
-Yes, I heard.
-We let her go every single time.

241
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,258
I can't believe she's here again.

242
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,970
Next time, we won't let her go so easily.

243
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,023
AFFIANT KANG SIN-JAE

244
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,358
BUDAEJJIGAE

245
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,985
In this world,
there's a dish called budaejjigae.

246
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,613
I heard it was invented
during the Korean War.

247
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,242
It's interesting.
Both this and "half and half."

248
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,037
This is the place.

249
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,460
Look who's here.

250
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,840
Of course, I'd run into my enemy
in front of an amazing restaurant.

251
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,883
Last time, there were three.

252
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,679
I'm still all swollen
from getting beaten up that day.

253
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,098
How come it's just the two of you today?

254
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,100
I have seven men today.

255
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,353
I guess I won't be able
to try this stew today.

256
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,772
I have Yeong today.

257
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,484
Yeong. Don't kill them.

258
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,528
They're ordinary civilians.

259
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,737
Oh, boy.

260
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,242
I didn't expect something like this
would happen.

261
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,619
What?

262
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,039
When did you switch places?

263
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,126
Where's my Unbreakable Sword?

264
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,213
He told me
to just stay quiet and eat with you.

265
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,966
What the heck is going on?

266
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,429
Stand behind me.

267
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,514
Try to hide far away.

268
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,641
Yeong will show up--

269
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,684
Good luck!

270
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,438
Is that punk running away?

271
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,024
Goodness, your teamwork sucks.

272
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,401
Are you going to be okay?

273
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,153
For now, I'm here alone.

274
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,864
Will eight of you be enough?

275
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,286
Boys, do him in good.

276
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,455
Let's get even.

277
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,923
God. I have to tell Tae-eul.

278
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,674
Gosh!

279
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,476
Wow.

280
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,781
-Thank you. The food was great.
-Thank you.

281
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,452
Gosh, jeez.

282
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,995
-Are they fighting?
-Goodness.

283
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,247
Jeez, idiots.

284
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,669
What the...

285
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,003
Hey.

286
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,423
That cool-looking dude
can't be Eun-sup, right?

287
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,343
Guys!

288
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,433
What the hell are you guys doing
on the roadside in broad daylight?

289
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,351
Guys, run!

290
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,690
I said, stop.

291
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,108
PARK MUN-SIK

292
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,484
JEONG TAE-EUL

293
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,530
-Are you doing military duties right now?
-Yes.

294
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,699
Hey.

295
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,367
I'll handle the rest.

296
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,580
Eun-sup, you totally surprised us.

297
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,000
You were like a ninja.
Have you been working out?

298
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,550
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

299
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,762
I didn't want you to see this. Jeez.
It was no biggie.

300
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,516
These guys were bullying a passerby,
so I taught them a lesson.

301
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,227
You guys are so screwed now.

302
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,188
Look, I'm the one
who should be calling the cops.

303
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,982
I mean, you beat me up.

304
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,444
Something's weird.
I clearly saw him running away earlier.

305
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,903
You saw him running away,

306
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,240
but you mobilized your boys
and got caught.

307
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,743
Therefore, you must come with us

308
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,953
and fill out the statement form, okay?

309
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,789
Hang on. Who's that guy by the way?

310
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,208
How come he keeps staring at Eun-sup?

311
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,796
I'll introduce myself. I am--

312
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,214
Shut it, dude.

313
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,092
The elders are talking.
Don't you dare cut in.

314
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,262
He's my friend from Busan.

315
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,931
It's his first time in Seoul,
so he can't do anything.

316
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,768
-He can't even eat without me.
-You haven't eaten yet?

317
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,102
Hey, go eat something.

318
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,937
And come to write the statement.

319
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,027
Dude, come on!

320
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,031
Watch where you're going.
Your legs are long but useless.

321
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,532
That nutjob.

322
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,743
Nice to meet you, buddy. Enjoy your lunch!

323
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,121
I'm sure that's not the guy I saw earlier.

324
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,665
That lanky prick said he came alone,

325
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,334
but there are five of you in total.

326
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,585
What? Are you a rapper?

327
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,259
-Eun-sup.
-It's me, Yeong.

328
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,805
No, you are Eun-sup.
You were Eun-sup earlier.

329
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,557
Yeong would never...

330
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,685
He'd never call me a fool.

331
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,688
Yeong knows
what I use my long legs for.

332
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,608
I apologize.
I tend to improvise in emergencies.

333
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,902
-So, you are Yeong?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,113
Then you'll be beheaded
according to the law.

335
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,781
Maybe I'm Eun-sup.

336
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,367
You'll also be beheaded
according to the Foreigners Act.

337
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,372
However,

338
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,418
I wish to be a wise and merciful king.

339
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,003
I shall have mercy on you.

340
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,217
Come here.

341
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,561
Don't forget. You'll be beheaded
if you remove this mole.

342
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,815
Thank you for your boundless mercy.

343
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,151
Sure thing.

344
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,199
It's me.

345
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,868
Hey, where are you?

346
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,744
What's up?

347
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,205
You told me to call you
when I'm on the move.

348
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,167
I'm calling as I'm rushing somewhere.

349
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,043
-Where to?
-To the living room.

350
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,590
Eun-sup's place can't be that big.

351
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,676
I moved to a hotel.

352
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,262
Eun-sup's siblings
have gone back to school.

353
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,806
Now, I'm headed to the fridge.

354
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,391
It's time for coffee.

355
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,395
The fridge? You should've called me
when you were leaving his place

356
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,855
to go to the hotel.

357
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:45,901
What?

358
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,277
What happened?

359
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,280
Hello? What's wrong? Did you get hurt?

360
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,991
It's not that. I'm just surprised.

361
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,245
The coffee Yeong got tastes
just like the one I drink at the palace.

362
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,415
Rich at the beginning
and clean at the end.

363
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,126
This is sold in stores here?

364
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,961
Are you kidding me?

365
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,714
I know which hotel it is.

366
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,591
I'm in the area now.

367
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,010
I'll give you ten minutes.
Come down right now.

368
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,932
So my theory was right.

369
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,769
I have to irritate her to see her.

370
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,192
She'll say she has to leave quickly.

371
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,737
I'd say about 20 minutes?
I'm saying, don't follow me.

372
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,231
Eight minutes and forty seconds.

373
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,067
I came down right away.

374
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,946
-Yeong wanted to follow me, so I--
-The very first time you came here...

375
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,201
Would you still have fallen for me
even if I had never helped you?

376
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,331
I would've understood.

377
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,837
And that understanding
would've led me to fall for you.

378
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,923
What if I was super rude to you?
Still the same?

379
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,133
You were.

380
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,804
Yes, stil.

381
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,059
Why?

382
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,353
Because you must've had your reason.

383
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,444
It took me a long time to realize this.

384
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,656
When it's fate, there are no coincidences.

385
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,410
Your fate is determined
by the choices you make,

386
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,579
but there are times

387
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,416
when your fate chooses you.

388
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,585
Why do you ask?

389
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,755
In the beginning,
you ask about everything.

390
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,506
We just skipped too many things.

391
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,968
I have to go on a stakeout.

392
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,305
I got to see you, so I'm off.
Nothing happened, right?

393
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,601
No, not at all.

394
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,812
It's been a quiet, peaceful day.

395
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,733
This is the most eventful moment
of the day.

396
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,402
You came to see me

397
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,529
despite the traffic jam.

398
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,782
I haven't eaten yet, so I'm irritable now.

399
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,079
I'll add one more into the 17 rules.
No cheesy comments when I'm hungry.

400
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,248
I'm glad everything is good. I'm off.

401
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,628
Things that are bound to happen

402
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,881
are taking place even at this moment.

403
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,928
I was struck with a sad premonition
that this will be short-lived,

404
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,724
but I decided to love my fate

405
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,018
that chose me.

406
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,395
I love you.

407
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,405
Yeong is in the hotel room, right?

408
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,656
Hang on.

409
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,080
I'm still mesmerized
by what you said earlier.

410
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,131
Yeong went out. He just walked by.
Didn't you see him?

411
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,549
He has to... No.

412
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,051
That's not important.

413
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,346
I mean,

414
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,642
-you just said--
-I told you he can't go out.

415
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,269
Find him and go back in.

416
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,439
Jeong Tae-eul.

417
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,234
Ditto.

418
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,506
So you heard what I said.

419
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,889
Don't worry about Yeong.

420
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,642
He's done it once,
so he won't get busted again.

421
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,736
Hey, Jo Eun-sup!

422
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,281
I'm in trouble. A female voice.

423
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,416
Don't you dare run away.
You were about to sprint!

424
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,171
She looks like Seung-a.

425
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,381
I wonder who that woman is.

426
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,593
What the heck? Shouldn't you be
at the police station now?

427
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,388
Hold on, you're wearing...

428
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,475
Did you have a blind date?

429
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,436
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,688
Were you at a funeral?

431
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,108
You got your hair done.

432
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,945
I can't draw any more attention.

433
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,329
Are you calling me over?

434
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,331
With your finger?

435
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,084
Jeez, has he lost his mind?

436
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,216
It'd better be something important!

437
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,678
She's tough.

438
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,097
Then there's only one way.

439
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,565
I'm curious about something.

440
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,364
Do I have a crush on you?
Or is it the other way around?

441
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,700
I mean, in this world.

442
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,372
This is why you don't have a girlfriend.

443
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,707
Cut it out.

444
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,627
-What's that on your face? Seaweed?
-Don't touch it, or--

445
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,005
Or what? Try causing trouble.

446
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,382
I made japchae, so pick it up later.

447
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,810
Gosh, that guy can fight.

448
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,021
I'm a pretty good fighter too.

449
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,822
Jeez, you scared the crap out of me.
What do you want from me?

450
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,158
Tae-eul said
that you can only go out at night--

451
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,660
Who is this woman?
She's kind of pretty and...

452
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,829
Jo Yeong. You're really him.
Unbelievable.

453
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,497
-She has pretty eyes.
-Na-ri.

454
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,333
-She drives a supercar.
-Myeong Na-ri.

455
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,085
Hey, did you meet Na-ri?

456
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,546
What did she say?
Tell me everything she said.

457
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,258
She wants to get in trouble with you.
And told me to pick up japchae.

458
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,221
Japchae? Get in trouble? With me?

459
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,725
Can you elaborate?

460
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,811
What did you say before japchae?
Why would she give me that?

461
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,064
-Do you have a crush on her?
-Who wouldn't?

462
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,110
Anyway, I can't go now.

463
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,905
Call her and tell her
that I'll stop by another time.

464
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,198
I need to calm down first.

465
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,159
Na-ri and I? Our first japchae together?

466
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,203
Loser.

467
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,622
For how long? Would ten minutes be enough?

468
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,292
A hundred years! Loser.

469
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,053
You're here.

470
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,471
Hey, any leads?

471
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,974
So far, nothing.

472
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,813
It's refreshing.

473
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,731
You know your kimchi, Jangmi.

474
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,654
What is all that?

475
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,616
Detective Shim said
I need many things for my first stakeout.

476
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,577
Are you going camping?

477
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,625
By the way, what's going on with Sin-jae?
Why did he switch with you?

478
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,335
I didn't ask.

479
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,215
I wouldn't have to ask
if he was going to tell me.

480
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,050
Impressive.

481
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,137
That's why I didn't ask him either.

482
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,436
What?

483
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,314
Are you amazed by how wise I am?

484
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,482
No, it's not that.

485
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,153
What is that little gadget?
You can use it for your lips and face?

486
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,074
The old sayings are always so true.

487
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,661
You can't even use multi-purpose balm
in front of kids.

488
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,914
You can have it.
This is the be-all and end-all.

489
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,001
Thank you.

490
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,753
Oh my.

491
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,382
Are we sure Park Jung-gu isn't home yet?

492
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,384
Yes, I checked.

493
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:14,927
Okay.

494
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,554
Oh, nice.

495
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,932
About the victim...

496
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,979
She probably never imagined
she'd die like that, right?

497
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,776
Jangmi.

498
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,529
It's your first time
at a murder scene, right?

499
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,073
Yes.

500
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,366
Did you know many cops commit suicide?

501
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,785
What?

502
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,662
You'll see countless more cases like this
going forward.

503
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,456
Work is work.

504
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,751
We do our best to investigate every case.

505
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,798
When the case is closed, we have to do
our best to forget about it and move on,

506
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,550
or you can't do this for a long time.

507
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,803
Okay.

508
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,724
What do we need to do to close this case?

509
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,268
We should catch the killer, right?

510
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,271
-Yes.
-Keep your eyes peeled.

511
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,482
Yes, will do.

512
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,987
Park Jung-gu, spotted.

513
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,198
Jangmi, let's go!

514
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,120
-Mr. Park Jung-gu?
-Damn it!

515
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,754
My gosh.

516
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,096
Tae-eul! I caught him.

517
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,726
I think I caught the suspect.

518
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,603
All right.

519
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,110
But he doesn't seem to be breathing.

520
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,822
Hey, no.
We don't have an extra set of handcuffs.

521
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,576
Mr. Park Jung-gu.

522
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,120
Wake up.

523
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,913
Jangmi caught Park Jung-gu.

524
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,125
Mr. Park.

525
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,751
I just got home.

526
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,337
I'll be there fairly soon.

527
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,631
Tae-eul, he's not breathing...

528
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,841
What do I do?

529
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,469
Sin-jae, don't pretend
you haven't seen my message.

530
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,679
Mr. Park!

531
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,739
This restaurant is busy.

532
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,910
Mom.

533
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,829
Is it that fun?

534
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,251
I'm sorry.

535
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,379
I promise I won't do it again.

536
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,675
When I'm sitting there,
I feel like everything will go well.

537
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,387
And it helps me get my mind off things.

538
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,143
I'm broke now,
so I can't even wager large amounts.

539
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,815
You were ill for a long time, you know.

540
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,988
When you regained your consciousness,
I felt like the whole world was mine.

541
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,283
I thought only happiness awaited us.
But your dad ended up like that.

542
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,953
And I just couldn't pull myself together.

543
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,748
How's Dad?

544
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,459
Is he doing all right?

545
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,586
Well, you know.

546
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,591
He told me that you've been

547
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,594
sending money monthly
to his inmate account.

548
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,431
Mom.

549
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,143
Were you happy when I woke up?

550
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,979
Gosh, of course.

551
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,065
Your dad and I thought we'd lose you.

552
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,025
That one yearÂ was hell for us.

553
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,071
Gosh, thinking about that time
still makes my heart pound.

554
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,826
I felt the same way.

555
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,496
When I woke up,

556
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,666
you held me in your arms.

557
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,421
And you smelled so nice.

558
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,883
That's when I first realized

559
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,761
that a person

560
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,264
could smell so good.

561
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:47,950
Mom.

562
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:50,911
You see,

563
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,543
I was always so happy to be your son.

564
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,846
I know that I wasn't

565
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,849
always a good son to you.

566
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,188
I called the cops on you...

567
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,319
I'm really sorry, Mom.

568
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,572
So please.

569
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,452
Do not ruin yourself anymore, please.

570
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,455
I'm sorry for everything.

571
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,211
I should've stayed away from gambling
no matter how stressed out I was.

572
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,508
I'm sorry for everything.

573
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,637
I'm...

574
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,557
incompetent and pathetic,

575
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,643
so I feel bad saying this to you, but...

576
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:00,981
Kang Sin-jae.

577
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:02,983
You're...

578
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,987
a miracle to me.

579
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,379
Eat up.

580
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,728
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

581
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,063
It wasn't me.

582
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,689
Why would I kill her?

583
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,359
When I got there, she was already dead.

584
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,779
As for the blood, I freaked out
and touched her to see if she was alive.

585
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,072
I see.

586
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:16,075
I was going to wash up at a buddy's place
in the area and call.

587
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,077
-But you didn't.
-Exactly.

588
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,870
You've never been in that situation.

589
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,872
Your mind goes numb, seriously.

590
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,251
We went through your texts.
You owed her five million won.

591
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,672
Did you kill her
so that you wouldn't have to pay her back?

592
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,590
Jeez, this is driving me nuts.

593
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,636
I called her because of that message,
but she didn't pick up.

594
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,887
So I went there.

595
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,473
Eun-mi didn't have five million won
to lend to me.

596
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,850
She couldn't even pay
her credit card bills.

597
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,396
Jeez, this is nuts.

598
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,235
Jang Yeon-ji is now our key suspect.
Let's try to track her down.

599
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,113
We can only keep her for 48 hours
even if we get her.

600
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,323
We don't have any decisive evidence.

601
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,826
-I mean, do we have anything?
-We might.

602
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,912
I read a script Jang Yeon-ji was reading.

603
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,248
There's a case
with the same method of killing.

604
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,126
The bloody clothes is burned
on a rooftop.

605
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,421
It has a catchy title.
"The Desires of Magma."

606
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:14,174
My, I'm already hooked.
I'm dying to find out what it's about.

607
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,427
Hey, I think someone's phone is buzzing.

608
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,512
-Is it you?
-Oh, yes.

609
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,396
It's Jang Yeon-ji.

610
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,481
Answer it. Quick!

611
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,403
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul speaking.

612
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,662
Jang Yeon-ji wants to turn herself in.

613
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:44,997
Gosh.

614
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,088
Everything is clear. You can go in now.

615
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,300
I finally get to try this stew.

616
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,102
Are you ready to order?

617
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,022
Min-hui, clean Table Three first.

618
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,567
Fill up the water bottle and...

619
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:14,777
Your...

620
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,956
I suppose...

621
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,710
I'll never get to taste this stew.

622
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:33,962
Yeong.

623
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,548
We need to get out of here.

624
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,592
What's the matter?

625
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,346
The owner of that restaurant
recognized me.

626
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,806
And you too.

627
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,226
But how could someone in this world
recognize--

628
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,977
It means he doesn't belong here.

629
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,815
If he flees,
it means that he recognized us.

630
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,233
And if that happens,

631
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,529
you have to catch him. At all costs.

632
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,031
Don't worry about me.

633
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,742
Yes, Your Majesty.

634
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,544
The five people who will help me

635
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,213
regardless of what...

636
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,274
CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY
AND THE ROYAL FAMILY

637
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,655
PRINCE IMPERIAL GEUM
LEE LIM

638
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,741
I left my umbrella here a long time ago.

639
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,534
Do you still have it?

640
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,417
Your clothes, right?

641
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,128
We found the victim's blood on it.

642
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,215
And we found your fingerprints
on the steel trash can.

643
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,801
Why did you kill her?

644
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,137
I just couldn't stand her.

645
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,891
Why did you message Park Jung-gu?

646
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,061
I couldn't stand him either.

647
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,190
So you confessed to everything.

648
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,401
Jang Yeon-ji, you're under arrest
for the murder of Ha Eun-mi.

649
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,537
You see, that girl always
gave me the creeps.

650
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,165
That scary bitch.
I can't believe she killed her friend.

651
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,587
I know you lost the woman you loved.

652
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,048
I'm sorry for your loss,
but I need to say this.

653
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,302
I hope this won't happen again.
But next time, call the police first.

654
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,222
I didn't love her.

655
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,350
It was just a fling.

656
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,020
Yeon-ji says she's an aspiring actress,

657
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,732
but she has two phones.
I bet she works at a bar.

658
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,902
What did you just say?

659
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,029
He was carrying two phones around...

660
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,991
Jang Yeon-ji has two cell phones?

661
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,327
Is one of them a 2G phone?

662
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,579
How would I know?

663
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,498
The dead girl told me
that she has two cell phones.

664
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,127
Jeez, I wish she died a few days later.

665
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,547
I was going to break up with her.
This sucks.

666
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,094
Damn it.

667
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,221
Have you lost your mind?

668
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,556
Are you nuts?

669
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,309
Did a cop just hit a civilian
in front of the station?

670
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,103
Hey.

671
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,606
Be respectful to the deceased.

672
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,691
Get lost, or I'll punch you again.

673
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,528
I need to close this case and move on too.

674
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,344
Found it.

675
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,806
The charger is here, so the phone must be
somewhere around here too.

676
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,396
Give this to Tae-eul.

677
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,692
She asked me to look him up
due to some intel she received.

678
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,403
Additional info on Lee Ji-hun, age eight.
She'll know.

679
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,241
DEATH CERTIFICATE
NAME: LEE JI-HUN

680
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,994
Tae-eul is after a boy

681
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,331
-who died 25 years ago?
-You know nothing about this?

682
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,541
It must be top-secret.

683
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,044
-Then give it back.
-I know what it is.

684
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,297
It must be for the science fiction thing.
I'm off.

685
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,215
Okay.

686
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,718
Tae-eul, what are you up to?

687
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,639
BUDAEJJIGAE

688
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,154
Now, I know for sure.

689
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,866
You know who I am,
and you recognized His Majesty.

690
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,876
You'd better stay put

691
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,212
unless you want to die without procedures.

692
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,719
LEASING INQUIRIES

693
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,319
Who are you?

694
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,491
You're from the Kingdom of Corea.
Why are you here?

695
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,368
I want to hear your story.

696
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,705
You are here too, Your Majesty.

697
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,586
I see that you're not trying
to protect your life.

698
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,213
You must've been trained professionally.

699
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,507
And you work for Lee Lim, the traitor.

700
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,677
Where is he now?

701
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,228
You look a lot like your father.

702
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,442
Will your life end the same way as he did?

703
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,615
You must be one of those
who stood on my father's blood.

704
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,087
And you came here
as a compensation for that bloodbath?

705
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,089
That is called balance.

706
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,257
It is reasonable and fair.

707
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:39,179
You were lucky enough to be born
with everything,

708
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,890
so don't whine about losing your father.

709
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,683
Yeong.

710
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,735
Only God can restore that "balance."

711
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,822
What you scoundrels are doing

712
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,574
is murder.

713
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,743
Remember that.

714
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,788
Take him back to the Kingdom of Corea.

715
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,456
Kill me.

716
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,502
Just kill me!

717
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,511
There are no numbers saved on this phone.

718
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,888
I suppose this is just...

719
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,975
for answering the calls.

720
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,479
That means I can answer
at least one phone call.

721
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,359
Take your own life.

722
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,946
It is a suicide order.

723
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,576
Inmate 1834, you have a visitor.

724
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,169
What's going on?

725
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,336
Just follow me.

726
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,465
-Why did you turn yourself in?
-You came to see me because of that.

727
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,133
I had no other choice.

728
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,220
You drew the line,
and I had nowhere to hide.

729
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,805
-What else could I do?
-Where's the phone?

730
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:51,394
I canceled the service,
but I need the phone back.

731
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,356
I hid it in a safe place, of course.
It's my only hope.

732
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,152
-When will you get me out?
-Where did you hide it?

733
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,404
It's a secret.

734
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,782
When can I go to the other side?

735
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,619
Jeez. You shouldn't have killed anyone
if you wanted to go there.

736
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,955
That too, I had no other choice.

737
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,000
Eun-mi overheard the phone conversation.

738
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,964
So get me out quickly
before I hand it over to the cops.

739
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:20,632
You can, right?

740
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,763
I'm just curious.

741
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,559
Have you ever heard of a power outage
at a detention center?

742
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,230
What do you mean?

743
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,859
This isn't a power outage?

744
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,162
I can switch it off and on
whenever it's necessary.

745
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,206
Whatever it may be.

746
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,667
Click.

747
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,380
Try to remember

748
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,717
where you hid the 2G phone.

749
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,594
Call me when you remember it.

750
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:32,037
I'll rent your building for a while.
Thank you for your help.

751
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,582
Let me know if it's not enough.
If it's more than enough,

752
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,460
-can I get one of these?
-Jeez.

753
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,964
I'll gladly give you two cups of it.

754
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,300
Gold is in, you know?

755
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,429
You'll need two.

756
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,014
Tae-eul is here.

757
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,444
Did the stakeout go well?

758
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,238
I heard you caught the culprit too.

759
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,451
No way.
Did you have Jo Yeong tail me again?

760
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,081
Yes, just briefly though.

761
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,209
But he can't do it anymore as he's busy.

762
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,461
So make sure
that buddy of yours tags along.

763
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,171
This was a big decision.

764
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,424
You think I'm being like this
for having him tail me?

765
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,675
Isn't it?

766
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,221
You should've done it yourself.
Why send someone else?

767
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,352
That would be nice,
but I'm not good at hiding.

768
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,437
I stand out wherever I go.

769
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,525
I light up a room just by walking into it.
It must be happening now too.

770
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,403
Na-ri, is it still not ready?
Hurry up. I want a cold drink.

771
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,904
Here are your drinks.

772
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,158
First, just try it without stirring it.

773
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,661
Taste the delicious sweetness,
and then stir it.

774
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,874
Although I can see that there's already
too much sweetness going on here.

775
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,586
Hey, take some japchae home.

776
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,299
Why isn't Eun-sup coming for his japchae?
It'll swell up.

777
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,178
I figured out something quite important.

778
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,181
I think she has feelings for Eun-sup.

779
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,268
You got it all wrong.

780
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,937
Eun-sup has a crush on her.

781
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,856
No way.

782
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,151
Gosh, you're so slow-witted.
I don't think we can work together.

783
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,658
I looked into this.

784
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,702
His name is Lee Seong-jae.

785
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,372
He died in 1995 at a care center.

786
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,668
That's where he was last seen,
but there are no records.

787
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,963
And he supposedly died a natural death.

788
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,423
Did he have poliomyelitis?

789
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:49,799
Yes, he did.

790
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,885
Did he have a family?

791
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,308
Do I exist

792
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,477
in this world?

793
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,110
No, not anymore.

794
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,404
He died when he was eight.

795
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,700
So he first killed himself

796
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,536
and then killed me.

797
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,165
Any other family members?

798
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,460
A brother or sister-in-law, for instance.

799
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,254
His younger brother also died.

800
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,298
But that brother's wife...

801
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,259
She's still alive.

802
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:43,770
Are you okay?

803
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,315
If he and Lee Lim had
the same family members,

804
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:52,487
then his sister-in-law
would probably have my mother's face.

805
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,242
Her name is Song Jeong-hye.

806
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,456
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

807
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,959
I'm planning to visit her address.

808
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,752
You must cooperate.

809
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,797
I am at your command.

810
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,098
You were right.

811
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:21,683
About what?

812
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,394
That part of the room looks so bright.

813
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,920
Father...

814
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,213
After his coronation,

815
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,466
King Lee Gon began his first duty as king,
mourning his father's death

816
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,343
for 26 days according to court laws.

817
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,696
That man came by, looking for Ji-hun.

818
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,867
I guess we'll finally get busted.

819
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,377
Is he Ji-hun's friend?

820
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,505
He seems to be around Ji-hun's age.

821
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,343
You can report it.

822
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:22,220
I don't care.

823
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,975
I won't die anyway.

824
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:32,772
I can't die.

825
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,693
You people will bring me
back to life again.

826
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,857
What? I didn't know you were there.

827
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,943
Gosh, I just wanted to wear his coat.

828
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,784
Wow, I look great.

829
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,331
Oh, come on.
A picture with his boss as the wallpaper?

830
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,668
Jeez, this nutcase.
Something is definitely wrong with him.

831
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,753
Who?

832
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,173
Gosh, you scared me.
Hey, Sin-jae!

833
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,634
-Leaving for the day?
-Yes, 6 p.m. on the dot.

834
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,637
Right on time today.
And tomorrow, I'll be done for good!

835
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,514
-You're discharged tomorrow.
-Yes.

836
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,558
Congratulations. Hand that phone over.

837
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:55,897
The phone?

838
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,358
Why? It's my new phone.

839
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,110
I saw something weird on it.

840
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,072
-Must I take it by force?
-Well...

841
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,658
That guy, Arthur, you know?
He came back and--

842
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,618
Don't move.

843
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,048
-It's a photo of me and him.
-I can't talk for long now.

844
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:26,344
I'll say I believe you.
Just tell me where this prick is now.

845
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,099
He's at a hotel.

846
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,687
He was staying with me,
but my siblings are visiting,

847
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,856
so I booked a room for him under my name.

848
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,984
Then they'll give me a key
if I go with you.

849
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,072
Why schedule all the on-site visits
in the evening?

850
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,699
Gosh, I almost swore at them.

851
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,291
Prime Minister Koo,

852
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:01,546
the Secretariat sent
the 2019 departmental performance report.

853
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,465
Why does everyone look for me
whenever I have this on?

854
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,888
Does this have a sensor or something?

855
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,807
Does an alarm trigger when I rest?

856
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:14,600
Of course not.

857
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,812
There are many invitations
for the holiday season.

858
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,357
Why do they keep inviting me
when I never attend their events?

859
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,277
They just love to bad-mouth me
for not coming.

860
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,072
Your family sent you something else.

861
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:28,990
Again?

862
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,039
Thank you. You can go home.

863
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:37,957
Thank you.

864
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,176
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

865
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:51,554
It's the same one.

866
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:16,871
Hello?

867
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:17,788
Mom.

868
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,583
You really didn't send me anything?

869
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,336
-You didn't send a newspaper?
-Newspaper?

870
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:27,006
Who reads newspapers these days?
Everyone uses their phones.

871
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,508
I was actually going to call you--

872
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,218
Mom, I'll call you later.

873
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,021
A repeating pattern means it's a sign.

874
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,492
US-KOREA SUMMIT
AT POST OUELLETTE INSIDE DMZ

875
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:58,788
BTS TAKES THE WORLD BY STORM

876
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:06,754
What is this?

877
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,256
What am I supposed to see--

878
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:07,523
CONTACTS
JEONG TAE-EUL

879
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,259
AUTOPSY REPORT

880
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,181
BY LEE JONG-IN

881
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,937
THE KINGDOM OF COREA ROYAL COURT

882
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,067
What logo is this?

883
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,153
I'm asking as I saw it before.

884
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,698
Wherever you saw it, you're mistaken.

885
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,742
That logo is used...

886
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,329
Today is the 6th day of the funeral.
After his coronation, King Lee Gon...

887
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,581
...in a different country
in another world.

888
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,454
Jo Eun-sup.

889
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,165
I just saw you in the lobby...

890
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,212
Who are you?

891
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,464
You're not Eun-sup.

892
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,855
What is going on here?

893
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,944
This guy was going through your room.

894
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,036
I know you've been after this emblem.

895
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,915
But you don't know what it is, do you?

896
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:30,916
What is it?

897
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,168
It's our royal emblem.

898
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,377
Don't bullshit me.

899
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,754
You're just
an unregistered stateless dirtbag.

900
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,511
This bastard even has a gun?

901
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,434
Who the heck are you guys?

902
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,396
If I tell you,

903
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:55,649
will you believe me this time?

904
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,860
I've already told you who I am,

905
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:59,820
multiple times.

906
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,488
You'd better tell me the truth.

907
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,243
Then, where is your kingdom?

908
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,871
Somewhere else, not here.

909
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,000
To be more exact,
it's in a different world.

910
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:16,420
I've answered all your questions.

911
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,924
Now, it's your turn.

912
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,636
Who are you?

913
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:26,597
Who the heck are you?

914
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,185
Are you...

915
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,482
Lee Gon?

916
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:43,030
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul

917
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,992
even told you things like that?

918
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,747
Tae-eul knows about this too?

919
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,542
She's not the one who told you?

920
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:02,549
The public is watching

921
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:05,511
the young king's formality
with a sad heart.

922
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,055
Father...

923
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,225
That boy who was crying...

924
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,436
That was really you?

925
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,648
Are you really...

926
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:20,859
Lee Gon?

927
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,196
He heard my wailing.

928
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,407
A lot more people

929
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,576
have come over to this world
than I had thought.

930
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,247
Answer me, asshole.

931
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,457
Hands off unless you want to die.

932
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,084
One thing is for sure.

933
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,799
You are the reason
why I must return to my world.

934
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:49,138
It seems like...

935
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,268
I am your king.
