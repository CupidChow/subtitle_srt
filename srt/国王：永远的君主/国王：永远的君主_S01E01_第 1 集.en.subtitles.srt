1
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,273
This story begins

2
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,984
during King Sinmun's reign
in the Silla Dynasty.

3
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,738
This is recorded in
Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms.

4
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,782
"In the spring of the year 682,

5
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,451
King Sinmun received a bamboo flute

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,537
from the Dragon King of the East Sea.

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,667
When the flute is played,

8
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,462
enemies would retreat,
diseases would be cured,

9
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,090
rain would fall during droughts,
the rainy season would end,

10
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,759
the wind would stop,

11
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,345
and strong waves would subside."

12
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,139
Seeing its powers,

13
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,308
King Sinmun named the flute

14
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,435
"Manpasikjeok"

15
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,938
and designated it as a national treasure.

16
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,362
Although for people
who do not believe the story,

17
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,240
it is merely a myth.

18
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,534
Name, Lee Lim.

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,245
Born in February 1951.

20
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,871
Currently aged 70

21
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,832
in the year 2020.

22
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,291
DATE OF BIRTH: FEBRUARY 27, 1951

23
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,381
Explain this.

24
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,508
For me, this is harder to believe.

25
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,470
I really am 70 this year.

26
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,848
I've hardly aged

27
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,308
since the winter of 1994.

28
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:28,940
Since then, my time passed by slowly,
unlike you guys.

29
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,526
Why did it pass by slowly?
You're just a guy born in 1951.

30
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,614
Because I finally got my hands
on the Manpasikjeok.

31
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,451
I took it from my brother who had it,
but did not believe in it.

32
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:41,995
So,

33
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,455
did you kill

34
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,832
your brother?

35
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,752
The Manpasikjeok was revealed
only once every 20 years

36
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,505
to wish peace upon the world.

37
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,465
Just answer yes or no.

38
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,717
So...

39
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,677
did you kill your brother?

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,388
Yes, I did.

41
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,183
He was allowed to see it every day.

42
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,562
My naive half-brother, who became King

43
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,398
just because he was born
the legitimate son,

44
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,859
did not do anything

45
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,278
when he had the world in his hands.

46
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,658
He did not even know
that the Manpasikjeok in his hands

47
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,787
would bring the world to him.

48
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,416
To be exact, two different worlds.

49
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,753
I did expect

50
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,381
that one day, my nephew

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,010
would face that legend too,

52
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,430
just like me.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,062

00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,946
The King is in Cheonjongo.

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,243
Let's go.

61
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,288
What I need is over there.

62
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,672
-You...
-Yes.

63
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,425
They're helping me, Your Majesty.

64
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,974
Brother,

65
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,060
what are you doing?

66
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,813
Do you still not know

67
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,523
what I'm about to do?

68
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,358
Don't do this.

69
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,029
Put that sword down.

70
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,406
This is treason.

71
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,825
To you, it might be nothing but treason.

72
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,705
But I picked up this sword
to gain something even greater.

73
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,957
What is it
that you're so willing to kill for?

74
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,960
Do you not fear
the punishment of the skies?

75
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,515
The punishment of the skies?

76
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,976
I plan to become the very being
who gives punishment from the skies.

77
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,353
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,523
Brother.

79
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,652
God never created humans.

80
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,445
It was the weak

81
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,989
who created God.

82
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,885
Father.

83
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,096
Father!

84
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,266
Father!

85
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,476
Father!

86
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,687
Father!

87
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,900
Father.

88
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,239
Father.

89
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,158
His Majesty has already...

90
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,453
This is too bad.

91
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,250
You're an orphan now, Your Highness.

92
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,644
Do you really think
you can hurt me with that?

93
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,895
I will try!

94
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,499
This is treason.

95
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,211
I order the Royal Guards
to arrest the traitor, Lee Lim.

96
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,716
I deprive Prince Imperial Geum
of his royal status

97
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,637
and sentence him to the maximum penalty
in accordance with national law.

98
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,977
You sound like the Crown Prince
for the first time in your life.

99
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm ready, sir.

100
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,876
I will do it myself.

101
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,098
I've waited all my life
for this very moment.

102
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,976
I hid my desires,
gathered people to assist me,

103
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,647
endured your foolish father and mine,

104
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,984
and quietly waited for this day
my entire life.

105
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,113
So how dare you...

106
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,949
How dare a little kid like you...

107
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,452
You useless and powerless punk...

108
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,997
How dare you mess this up?

109
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,023
Your Highness!

110
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,124
Emergency alert.
There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.

111
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,792
There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.

112
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,880
Your Highness, we've lost too much time.
You need to get out of here.

113
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,881
It won't take long.

114
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,393
Sir, you won't be able to escape
once the Royal Guards get here.

115
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,800
Let's go.

116
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,553
We're going to leave the palace right now!

117
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,535
Emergency alert.

118
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,747
All Royal Guards gear up
and gather at Cheonjongo.

119
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,600
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

120
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:45,449
Come back to us, Your Majesty.

121
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:51,997
Come back to us, Your Majesty.

122
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,878
Come back to us, Your Majesty.

123
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:03,759
Last night, Prince Imperial Geum
murdered King Lee Ho and fled.

124
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,845
The Royal Family's spokesperson
announced...

125
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,599
Prince Imperial Geum, who is currently
wanted for murder and treason,

126
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,476
will be stripped of his position.

127
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,397
So Crown Prince Lee Gon,
the first in line to the throne

128
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,526
of the Kingdom of Corea,
will be crowned King.

129
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,862
Second in line is
Prince Inpyeong's eldest son,

130
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,574
Prince Buyeong, Professor Lee Jong-in.

131
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,330
Salute.

132
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,459
At ease.

133
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,172
You're here, Prince Buyeong.

134
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,597
Is the Crown Prince awake yet?

135
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,600
I heard his neck was severely injured.

136
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,894
I am sorry to say this,

137
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:01,692
but asking about the Crown Prince's state
in the current situation

138
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,695
could lead to misunderstandings.

139
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,573
Whether I mention him or not,

140
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,992
people will gossip about me.

141
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,454
What about Lee Lim's whereabouts?

142
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,333
The Royal Guards and the police
are investigating together.

143
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,253
We're doing vehicle inspections.
Please open your trunk.

144
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,381
They closed off all the roads right away.

145
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,470
If he is still in Busan,
I'm sure they will find him.

146
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,977
I hope so too, but he seems
to have thoroughly prepared for this.

147
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,774
I believe he would have thought
of an escape plan first.

How in the world
are you walking around like this?

177
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,427
How can this happen?

178
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,778

00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,953
You're living such a lowly life.

183
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:12,127
Well, you and I do look alike.

184
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,716
But

185
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,928
we don't just look alike.

186
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,805
I am you.

187
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,017
You in a different world.

188
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,815
But I'm

189
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,735
very different from you.

190
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,364
I am much nobler

191
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,617
than you.

192
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,820
Uncle,

193
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,155
how are you...

194
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,453
standing?

195
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,180
Even in this world,
you've seen something you shouldn't have.

196
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,727
And you're holding something
you shouldn't be holding.

197
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:06,158
KINGDOM OF COREA
CORONATION OF THE THIRD KING

198
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,472
The King is entering!

199
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,697
KING LEE GON
THE THIRD KING OF THE KINGDOM OF COREA

200
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,610
Long live the King!

201
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,488
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

202
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,115
Long live the King!

203
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,492
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

204
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,661
Long live the King!

205
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,579
-Long live the King!
-Long live the King!

206
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,374
Today is the sixth day
of the former King's funeral.

207
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,376
After his coronation, King Lee Gon

208
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,671
began his first duty as King,
mourning his father's death for 26 days

209
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,798
according to court laws.

210
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:50,011
The public is watching the young King's
formality with a sad heart.

211
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,180
Father...

212
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,184
Father...

213
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,147
Father...

214
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,192
Father...

215
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,029
Father...

216
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,204
Is this your husband?

217
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,833
It seems he was in a hit-and-run accident
while he was drunk.

218
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,419
I know you're startled,
but we'd appreciate your cooperation.

219
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,713
Yes, that's my husband.

220
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,132
I was in the middle of work.

221
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,426
Can I go since I've confirmed it?

222
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,927
Oh, yes.

223
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,181
You may have his body transferred
tomorrow afternoon.

224
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,894
I...

225
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,231
I heard that...

226
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,860
the government
will cremate the body for you

227
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,778
if you sign something.

228
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,588
Well, at least he had a meal
before his death.

229
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,224
I guess there is a God.

230
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,519
My husband just died.

231
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,274
I prayed every day that he'd die.

232
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,527
I thought I would end up

233
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,321
either dying or killing him

234
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,740
before leaving this house.

235
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,161
But...

236
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,624
But someone killed him for me.

237
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,884
And the government
will cremate his body for me.

238
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,553
Now...

239
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,306
I can leave this house with Ji-hun--

240
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,748
Father...

241
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,127
Father...

242
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,298
Father...

243
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,177
Father...

244
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,428
Father...

245
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,429
Hey.

246
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,182
Hey, eat this.

247
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,683
I'll give this to you.

248
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,686
Put that away.

249
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,442
Father...

250
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,152
He's not moving an inch.

251
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,738
-Right.
-He shouldn't talk to the King like that.

252
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,949
It's all part of a plan.

253
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,410
Just wait and see.

254
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,563
Hey, is it fun to study?

255
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,568
How are you getting into this place?

256
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,653
Get out.

257
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,114
Do you think this whole place is yours?

258
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,865
Yes, this place is all mine.

259
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,409
So get out.

260
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,993
You're lying.

261
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,912
Who's your father?

262
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,997
He's your father's friend!

263
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,617
The funeral process is finally over.

264
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:53,374
You've done well in performing
your first duty, Your Majesty.

265
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,682
I miss my father.

266
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,313
I miss my father.

267
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,564
Yes.

268
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,650
I know, Your Majesty.

269
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,612
I know.

270
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,923
Why are you crying?

271
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,218
Don't cry.

272
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,495
You should stop crying too.

273
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,330
Here.

274
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,504
From now on, you're the Unbreakable Sword.

275
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,425
The Unbreakable Board? What's that?

276
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,389
What's your name, though?

277
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,392
Jo Yeong. What about you?

278
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,898
I am Lee Gon,
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

279
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,108
Okay, I get it.

280
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,443
Anyway,

281
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,904
thank you for this.

282
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,298
My goodness.

283
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,562
There's someone over here!

284
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,898
Help! There's someone here!

285
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,569
Help! Someone help!

286
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:34,118
ROYAL HOSPITAL OF COREA

287
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,042
Oh, gosh.

288
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,211
Hello.

289
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,548
This can't be revealed to the public,

290
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,469
so I had to ask you
to perform the autopsy yourself.

291
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,641
I have no idea what to do about this.

292
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,518
Calm down.

293
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,812
You made a wise choice.

294
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,731
I heard that the Royal Guards

295
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,525
think he committed suicide.

296
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,486
Yes, they say it seems like it.

297
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,323
He probably had nowhere to run.

298
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:18,246
They say all his bones were broken.
Probably due to the waves.

299
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,706
Even so,

300
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,709
this can never be suicide.

301
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,503
This has to be

302
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,965
a shooting by the Royal Guards.

303
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,466
Your Highness.

304
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,511
I will have to make a false statement

305
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,015
for the young King
and the Royal Court that is in chaos.

306
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,350
Do you understand?

307
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,353
Yes, Your Highness.

308
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:21,768
FORMER KING'S BASTARD LEE LIM
MEETS TRAGIC END

309
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,647
Your Highness,

310
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,191
you were alive?

311
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,485
You believed I was, didn't you?

312
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,529
Yes, I did.

313
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,989
I believed you were alive.

314
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,580
But how...

315
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,376
How can you still look the same?

316
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,670
It's been over a decade
since I last saw you.

317
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,463
How did you not age at all?

318
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,424
You've held out well.

319
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,261
Let me show you

320
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,389
a new world.

321
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,183
Yes, Your Highness.

322
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,358
KINGDOM OF COREA, BUSAN MAIN PALACE
THE FALL OF 2019

323
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,077
SUNGWOON GROUP
LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

324
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,413
THEY WILL ONLY ADVISE GROUP
ON LABOR UNIONS AND SUCCESSIONS

325
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,097
Yes, I'm caught today as well.

326
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,853
Prime Minister,
please step up onto the platform.

327
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,230
I need to do an additional
pat-down search.

328
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,822
Wireless bras
don't support my breasts properly.

329
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,658
I'll begin the pat-down search.

330
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,007
I will do it myself.

331
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,219
-Are you new?
-Yes, sir.

332
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,180
His Majesty does not like others
touching his body.

333
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,183
This may be a mistake,
but if it happens again, it's intentional.

334
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,769
-Keep that in mind.
-Yes, sir.

335
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,315
His Majesty is going
to the VIP horse riding course.

336
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,984
I'll drop by my bedroom first.

337
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,506
All right.

338
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,178
1. PICTURE IN THE HALLWAY
2. VASE NEXT TO BED

339
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,597
We have to replace these every month,

340
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,558
so make sure to write down
all the locations.

341
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,519
The first one is behind the painting,

342
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,479
and it goes counterclockwise.

343
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,399
And don't say a word to His Majesty.

344
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,734
Gosh,

345
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,487
I heard this talisman is the most
effective for finding a lover.

346
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,867
What? Why aren't you answering?

347
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,621
I almost had a heart attack.

348
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,377
I heard the Prime Minister came early
and is waiting right now.

349
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,088
What are you doing here?

350
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,841
These really seem to be effective.

351
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,595
I guess they have
the power to pull people toward you.

352
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,349
Prime Minister Koo must be coming early
every time because of these.

353
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,352
She might actually become the Queen.

354
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,936
Oh, that bitch...

355
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,898
I mean... My goodness.

356
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,984
She cannot become the Queen.

357
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,820
You said
you don't believe in superstitions.

358
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,655
These don't have any powers--

359
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,116
I don't, but you believe in them.

360
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,201
What?

361
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,245
You believe that someone might
actually answer your desperate prayers.

362
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,624
I have my reasons, you know.

363
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:41,670
The Royal Court
is more unstable than ever.

364
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,758
So, you know, you should get married--

365
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,218
I do not want to.

366
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,971
It is the King's duty
to produce an heir, and--

367
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,223
I am not interested.

368
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:57,853
How can you not be interested
when you are so young and decent?

369
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,023
My goodness. This is unbelievable.

370
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:05,319
You are the very first woman to be
so rude to me since I sat on the throne.

371
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,408
Goodness.

372
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,952
Oh, my.

373
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,995
-You shall be beheaded.
-What?

374
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,167
Tell Prime Minister Koo
we'll meet in two hours as planned.

375
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,047
My gosh. These are really expensive.

376
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,434
Let's put these clockwise this time.

377
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,065
Yeong, I found talismans again.

378
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,235
There were eight today.
That's 51 in total.

379
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,446
Really?

380
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,117
Why?

381
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,952
Is it not 51?

382
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,331
Did she hide more than that
when you were keeping a lookout?

383
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,584
I didn't take an active part in it.

384
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,545
Well, I'm going to reprimand you actively,
so just wait.

385
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,486
I know I'm here early, Your Majesty.

386
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,239
The weather was nice,

387
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,242
and I missed Maximus, so I hurried a bit.

388
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,870
Hi, Maximus.

389
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,542
He doesn't like women.
And he's spoiled, so he bites people too.

390
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,668
Me too.

391
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,295
I bite people often as well.

392
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,798
Can you wave your hand?

393
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,467
They're filming us 50 meters away.

394
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,679
The Royal Public Affairs Office
thought a photo here would look great.

395
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,723
It'll be hard to walk together.

396
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,433
Just stand over here.

397
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,310
The left side of your face is pretty.

398
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,272
And next time,
wear more comfortable shoes.

399
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,606
You're pretty considerate.

400
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,824
You shortened the state affairs
report time by half,

401
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,784
so I had no time to change my shoes.

402
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,328
Your reports last for
an average of 18 minutes,

403
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,956
so I believe 30 minutes is enough.

404
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,374
Shall we begin, then?

405
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,043
Should we shorten five more minutes
since we're busy?

406
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:13,507
Like I said in my written report,
the country is peaceful,

407
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,843
and the people are happy.

408
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,430
And they'll be happier
when they see our photo.

409
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,149
It is all thanks to you.

410
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,116
I'm thinking of learning
horse riding as well.

411
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,410
Do you think I'd do well, Your Majesty?

412
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,912
When you learn to ride,
this is what you hear first.

413
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,999
"If you have trained honestly every time,

414
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,378
your horse will take you
to the edge of the world."

415
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,217
Prime Minister, are you honest?

416
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,263
I received your report,

417
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,224
and we took enough photos,
so shall we end it here?

418
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,354
I have to get washed up
for my next meeting.

419
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,990
Oh, my gosh!

420
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,540
You nearly gave me a heart attack!

421
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,459
This is treason.

422
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,171
You should hurry. You might be late.

423
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,839
What will you do if I'm not late?

424
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,176
And how long have you been standing there?

425
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,553
Do you really want to know?

426
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,389
You're getting beheaded for sure.

427
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,641
This is when we say,
"You reap what you sow."

428
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,393
You bolt like this all the time.

429
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,021
And I don't know if you've dug
some kind of tunnel in your bathroom.

430
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,273
How can you say "bolt" to your King?

431
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,318
As you ordered, we got rid of the term
"single-parent family."

432
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,236
And the banners.

433
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,570
Yes, good job.

434
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,950
But how can you talk like that
to your King?

435
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,452
Everything here is mine.

436
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,913
Get it? It's all mine!

437
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,629
You know that now, don't you?

438
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,133
Hey, Unbreakable Sword.
Aren't you going to answer me?

439
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,300
Do you get it now?

440
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,220
FAIRY TALES TOLD BY THE KING

441
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:28,350
"Alice didn't even think
about how she would return

442
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,854
and jumped into the hole
after the White Rabbit.

443
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:36,567
She fell down and down.

444
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,570
She was falling endlessly.

445
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:45,492
She said in a loud voice, 'How many miles

446
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,077
have I fallen?'"

447
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,164
This is my favorite book.

448
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,041
The author was a mathematician, too.

449
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,627
How is it? Is it interesting?

450
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,296
-No!
-No!

451
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,422
It's boring.

452
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,845
I've never seen anyone talk
so honestly to me since I became King.

453
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,473
Your Majesty, do you have a girlfriend?

454
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,350
This is what we really need to ask.

455
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,727
Oh, no.

456
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:18,233
So even this young girl
is worried about the Royal Court.

457
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:20,986
All right.

458
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,656
I know who ordered you to ask that,

459
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,575
but I'll answer you.

460
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,787
I do not have a girlfriend yet.

461
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,502
Then you should follow
the White Rabbit too, Your Majesty.

462
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:37,878
Should I?

463
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,674
All right, then I guess
I should keep reading.

464
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,594
-"Alice..."
-No!

465
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,055
It's boring! Please!

466
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,701
-Move!
-Hey! Move it!

467
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,620
Find her! Where the hell did she go?

468
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,604
Long strides. Keep it firm.

469
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,564
Navy Academy.

470
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,898
The 88th class!

471
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,360
-Navy Academy.
-The 88th class!

472
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:44,820
Navy Academy.

473
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,405
The 88th class!

474
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,131
THE 88TH CLASS WILL TAKE
THE ROWING CUP AGAIN

475
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:17,144
Hey, men should wear little
and move a lot!

476
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,772
Hey, some men look awesome
even when they're all covered up.

477
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,441
This is so great.

478
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,158
He's moving to the finish line.

479
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,625
1. NAVY 88TH CLASS
2. UX CONSTRUCTION 3. ZENIST

480
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,002
Yes!

481
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,690
You'll need some water later.

482
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,151
Iced water for 1,000 won.
I have iced water here.

483
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,489
Hey, my water!

484
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,742
That crazy bitch! Damn it!
I haven't even sold any today yet!

485
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:17,037
-We are!
-Descendants of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin!

486
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,414
If we fight, we win! Yes!

487
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,669
That way! Run!

488
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,129
Where is she?

489
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,881
Damn it, move aside!

490
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:28,924
Move! Come on!

491
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,550
Damn it!

492
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,766
I'm really serious right now, okay?

493
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,601
If you don't want to die, move aside!

494
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,603
Boss, wait.

495
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,313
Don't move. Stay still.

496
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,439
-You idiot!
-Stay still.

497
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,982
How can I get her if I stay still?

498
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,442
What's this red thing on you?

499
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,569
What is that?

500
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,571
-Put your hands up!
-What? Why?

501
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,614
What's going on?

502
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,826
Soldiers? Why are soldiers here?

503
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,244
Why are they...

504
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,370
I'm sorry.

505
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,747
We should get away from here first.

506
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,000
Team One, take those jerks to the police.

507
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,253
Team Two, let's escort
the VIP away from here.

508
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,013
Your Majesty.

509
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,646
-Over there! His Majesty went that way!
-My gosh...

510
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:41,913
What?

511
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:47,335
Mom, His Majesty is really following
the White Rabbit with the clock.

512
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,264
You have really good stamina.

513
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,184
You rowed 2,000 meters
and you ran like that right after.

514
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,770
Why did you suddenly run like that?

515
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,651
I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.

516
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,777
What do you mean?

517
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,321
Are you saying
you saw a rabbit or a clock?

518
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,453
Weren't you listening
while I read Alice in Wonderland?

519
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,664
I was busy organizing my team's schedules.

520
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,040
You really need some

521
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,751
fairy tales in your life.

522
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,171
And I think you need some shoes,
Your Majesty.

523
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,550
These aren't my shoes.

524
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,388
You must wear this from now on.

525
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,807
You're going to protect me anyway.

526
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,017
Still, you must wear this.

527
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,771
Will you feel better if I do?

528
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,149
Then you can wear two for me.

529
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,694
I'm going to get a warning
if you don't listen.

530
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,737
You're the captain.
Who'd give you a warning?

531
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,197
My sense of duty.

532
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,413
You just made it really awkward.

533
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,917
We caught all the men
who caused the scene at the competition.

534
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,628
And we're looking for
the White Rabbit with the clock you saw.

535
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,632
I will check whether it is a rabbit
or a clock once when we find it.

536
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,898
Are you having fun, Captain Jo?

537
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,774
Don't.

538
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,319
Don't do what?

539
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,573
Why do you want to catch
the culprit yourself?

540
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,034
Do you want to get a Brave Citizen Award?

541
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,493
Why would I catch the culprit?

542
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,455
You should be catching the culprit
as the captain of the Royal Guards.

543
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,211
I'm not catching anyone.
I'm just trying to find...

544
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,089
the face that only I can recognize.

545
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,221
Every time something like this happens,

546
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,850
it feels like that person is there.

547
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,312
When it happened 25 years ago,

548
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:54,856
and today as well.

549
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,859
It's been 25 years.

550
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,737
Your savior must have aged a lot.

551
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,323
Do you think you can recognize the face?

552
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:05,909
I'm not sure.

553
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,913
We might have already met unknowingly.

554
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,292
But...

555
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,047
why hasn't my savior ever come to see me?

556
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,134
Because you've grown up well.

557
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,555
You don't need anyone's help now.

558
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,482
You're not mad at me anymore.

559
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,733
My dear Yeong.

560
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,528
How about a glass of beer?

561
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,154
No, thank you.

562
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,450
You can go home.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
THE FALL OF 2019

568
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,381
Oh, my. She totally crashed into it.

569
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,051
I think that'll cost about 370,000 won.

570
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,470
She didn't have to hit it that hard.

571
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,971
My goodness.

572
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,726
Hello, this is the security office.
You live in Unit 405, right?

573
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,270
-There's some bad news.
-Oh, no. What do I do?

574
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,565
Some woman just crashed
her car into yours!

575
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,858
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

576
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,490
I'm sorry!

577
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,750
What?

578
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,627
What? What is she doing?

579
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,590
Oh, gosh. She's insane.

580
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,385
Hey, that woman over there.
Hey, stop right there!

581
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,929
-Hey!
-It's illegal if you just leave. No, stop!

582
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:13,847
Hey, ma'am.

583
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,183
Did you see that?

584
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,519
You should come down. All right.

585
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,897
He won't come down.

586
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,733
Only delivery guys go up to his house.

587
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,320
-He hasn't come down in quite a while.
-I'm telling you, he'll come down.

588
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,323
Bad guys are more sensitive
when it comes to others breaking the law.

589
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,576
This is the most effective method.

590
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,329
Kim Bok-man and two others
have left the house.

591
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,708
-I'll block their escape route.
-Right.

592
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,297
Oh, no. This is awful.

593
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,631
What happened?

594
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,133
Damn it!

595
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,135
Mister, where did this bitch go? Where?

596
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,095
The bitch who crashed into my car.
Where is she?

597
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,769
Tae-eul, are you okay?

598
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:06,065
I'm fine. You know.
I've done this many times.

599
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:07,942
I'm not hurt. Don't worry.

600
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,028
I mean, is your outfit really okay?

601
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,447
Your top and bottom
really don't match right now.

602
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,824
What's wrong with my outfit?

603
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,412
It's all about being natural.
It emphasizes the colors of these clothes.

604
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,373
I'm dressed as a chic,
professional city girl.

605
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,167
I think I look pretty great.

606
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,003
You should've dressed up properly.
Why only focus on the colors?

607
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,802
She has such a filthy temper.

608
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,143
Wait, there's a weird smell.

609
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:43,895
Come down.

610
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,902
I'm saying some woman just
crashed her car into yours

611
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,986
and just drove off...

612
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,368
It's that car.
The one driving backward like that.

613
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,411
You drove off naturally,
but why are you coming...

614
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,413
Hey! Ma'am! What are you doing?

615
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,706
Hey! Damn it.

616
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,293
Hey! Damn it!

617
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:08,628
Damn it!

618
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,383
Ma'am...

619
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,759
What a crazy bitch.

620
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,219
Hey, do you have a death wish?

621
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,017
Oh, it hurts! My back!

622
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,399
Wait, I know this smell. Oh, no.

623
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,193
We found a body in the trunk.

624
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,862
We're changing this
from an illegal gambling website case

625
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,030
to a murder case.

626
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,700
No! I don't know that person!

627
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,703
I really don't know! I didn't kill him!

628
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,871
-Now give me your wrists.
-Damn it!

629
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,682
The other two are heading that way.

630
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,021
-Damn it.
-Hey.

631
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,607
One is going towards the playground.

632
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,568
You are mine.

633
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,371
Hey!

634
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,297
Shit.

635
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,223
Over here. That's it.

636
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,017
-Okay!
-Damn it. What the...

637
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,020
Nice shot!

638
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,189
Put on the handcuffs yourself.

639
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,273
Okay, let's go!

640
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,859
Hey, I really didn't kill that person.
Stop! Wait! Don't go!

641
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:02,492
-Forensics will be here in 20 minutes.
-Can't they come any faster?

642
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,827
You said it was just a plain
illegal gambling website case.

643
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,746
Are we going to have to work
overtime again?

644
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,414
I can't work overtime.

645
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,499
I'm serious.

646
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm totally serious right now.

647
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,379
-I can't do it until we get a new member.
-I can't do it either. Damn it.

648
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,797
When are we getting a new recruit?

649
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,840
I want one, too.
I think about it every day.

650
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,094
But I have no choice. Nobody wants
to join the Violent Crimes Division.

651
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,388
You can't get promoted,
the pay's bad, you get hurt,

652
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,764
you get disciplined for everything.

653
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,558
-Would you apply if it were you?
-But we're doing this job.

654
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,643
That's right!

655
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,522
But what's with your outfit today?

656
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,399
What? What about it?

657
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,318
I'm a chic, city girl.

658
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,986
This is a natural style.

659
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,198
But did you call me "ma'am" a while ago?

660
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,825
Anyone would have called you that.

661
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,248
He's right.

662
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,868
Tell Captain Jo that I'm going to check
whether it's a clock or a rabbit first.

663
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,875
Teams One and Two,
put on the harnesses and stand by.

664
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,752
Where are you right now, Captain?

665
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,399
We identified the body.

666
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,235
Lee Sang-do, age 45,
a hardware store owner.

667
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,905
He was a member of Kim Bok-man's
gambling website.

668
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,990
He took money worth a whole building
from that site.

669
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:10,036
But he put the store up for sale
and we can't get ahold of his wife.

670
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,330
I'll head back
after investigating around here.

671
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:15,291
Okay, I'm getting the security footage.
We'll discuss it at the station.

672
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,544
I want to check the security footage.

673
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,256
The VIP just passed Point 06. Over.

674
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,800
We're at Point 04.

675
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,468
Report at each point. Over.

676
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,109
What is it?

677
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,445
What's wrong, Maximus?

678
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,352
What was that?

679
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,480
Damn it. That startled me.

680
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,192
That's so scary.

681
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:35,533
I guess I really am getting old.

682
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,868
How could I hallucinate like that?

683
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,039
Gosh, my heart hurts.

684
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,465
What the hell is that?

685
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,384
What a weirdo.

686
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,760
Hey, there's a horse.

687
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,220
It's huge.

688
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,472
What's a white horse doing on the road?

689
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,684
You, the man on the horse,
stop right there.

690
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,938
Horse, horse-rider...

691
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,398
Excuse me, horse-rider.

692
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,443
Park your horse
on the side road to the right.

693
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,403
-Do you see that?
-What's that?

694
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,864
-He is so handsome.
-Park your horse right now.

695
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,117
He's not listening at all.

696
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,627
Maybe it's for a film.

697
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,837
He's really handsome.

698
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,740

699
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,163

702
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,077
You shouldn't
disturb the traffic like this.

703
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:44,620
Get down.

704
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,959
Where did a civilian
get a white horse like that?

705
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,005
You've violated the road traffic law.

706
01:08:57,341 --> 01:09:00,803
And you'll be given a heavier penalty
if that horse poops on the ground.

707
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,976
Why are you staring at me like that?

708
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,187
Oh, I see.

709
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,775
I'm a police officer. Get down from there.

710
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,987
And show me your identification card.

711
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,309
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

712
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,650
What the hell

713
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,069
do you think you're doing right now?

714
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,530
I've...

715
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:05,910
finally met you...

716
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,538
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

717
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:34,999
-Are you out of your mind?
-I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

718
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,251
I came to the conclusion
that this is a parallel universe.

719
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,752
This is a parallel universe?

720
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:42,423
I heard Tae-eul got herself into
a difficult situation with a handsome guy.

721
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:43,465
Kim Gae-ddong!

722
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,676
His Majesty was after whom? A woman?

723
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:48,512
-Did you find the woman they were chasing?
-Isn't that you, Yeong?

724
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,306
-What's your problem?
-I heard you're unidentified.

725
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,057
What is your relationship
with Lieutenant Jeong?

726
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,309
Container ship?

727
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,560
I can't stay here for long.

728
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,313
The reason why
I have to stay in your world.

729
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:00,399
Could there be a reason?
I like being here with you like this.

730
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,901
But I don't know you. How do you know me?

731
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,737
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

732
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,280
I take you...
