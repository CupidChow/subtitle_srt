PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,194
EPISODE 13

4
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,281
What happened to that war?

5
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:20,413
The war that broke out in June, 1950.

6
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,545
How do you know

7
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,924
about that war?

8
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,679
What you are thinking is right.

9
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,104
It was during the still of the dawn.

10
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,899
The cannons began to roar like thunder,

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,401
and all hell broke loose.

12
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,196
I was at a loss

13
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:58,201
after losing my parents and siblings.

14
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,412
Then one man came up to me

15
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,210
and asked if I wanted to go
to a world without war.

16
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,841
I left my hometown with just this book,

17
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,512
not knowing that
I would never be able to return.

18
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,015
That man was

19
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,728
His Majesty's grandfather, King Haejong.

20
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,025
What happened

21
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,320
to that world's history after that?

22
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,207
There was an armistice
three years after the war broke out.

23
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,795
The country is now divided
into North and South Korea,

24
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,840
so we can't go to Hwanghae Province
from Seoul.

25
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:58,970
I'm sorry

26
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,222
to tell you such sad news.

27
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,100
No.

28
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,854
It's fine.

29
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,984
There were many sad days,

30
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,486
but now I know

31
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,075
that everything was my destiny.

32
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,459
Just like how you ended up here.

33
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,883
All right.

34
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,678
Let's talk about that first.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to talk.

35
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,225
Everything in the news is true.

36
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,479
She's the woman I love.

37
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,898
I support her

38
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,692
every step and every moment.

39
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,991
You're always so honest, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,328
Even in moments like this.

41
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,042
That woman has a criminal record.

42
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,629
Are you to deceive the entire country?

43
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,382
I'm not asking for your support on this.

44
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,299
No.

45
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,760
That's not it.

46
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,513
I liked being next to you.

47
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,475
That was where I could see you the best.

48
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,229
But you say that it is not my place.

49
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,523
What should I do now?

50
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,445
Will I be able to see you better

51
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,907
if I stood in opposition to you?

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,336
Stop, Prime Minister Koo.

53
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,090
-If you cross the line further--
-I...

54
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,884
started at the bottom

55
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,430
and climbed up all the way here
toward the king.

56
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,016
But since you've had it all from birth,

57
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,020
love is all it takes to move you.

58
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,232
What will my heart beat for now,
Your Majesty?

59
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,651
I don't think it'll be for honesty
and loyalty.

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,419
I must not have fully recovered yet.

61
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,548
I'll be off now.
I'll see you for the state affairs report.

62
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,063
Ask the forensics team
if they have the autopsy results

63
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,732
of the traitor Kim Gi-hwan.

64
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,201
Since the moment your ID card fell
into the hands of His Majesty,

65
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:14,665
you have been the one guiding him
to his fate.

66
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,210
Please

67
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,505
take good care of His Majesty.

68
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,500
We meet again.

69
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,377
Right.

70
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,130
We met at Gwanghwamun, right?

71
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,923
I saw you buying shoes.

72
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,134
Ms. Koo Eun-a.

73
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,596
Oh, sorry.

74
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,350
I haven't seen anyone from here
mistake me for someone else.

75
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,686
I was talking about when we met
at KU Building.

76
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,357
Shouldn't you know
Prime Minister Koo Seo-ryeong by now

77
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942
if you plan to live here?

78
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,696
Your marriage proposal
shook the whole nation.

79
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,658
What did you do before and after
you met me?

80
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,119
I'm sure you didn't just buy shoes.

81
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,458
Stop acting so cocky and move.

82
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,252
You can't stop me yet.

83
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,754
You walked in here and stopped yourself.

84
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,133
You're heavy-hearted, right?

85
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,720
That's how heavy guilt can be.

86
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,691
Are you curious about what I did?

87
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,236
Of course, I didn't just buy shoes.

88
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,243
I mean the day we met
at KU Building, of course.

89
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,231
All right. I'll head there right away.

90
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,903
I'm sorry. You should go to bed first.

91
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,491
The coroner found the mark
on Kim Gi-hwan's body.

92
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,243
I need to go and check.

93
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,079
Do you know
that Koo Seo-ryeong has that mark too?

94
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,622
Did you see it too?

95
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,541
I ran into her in the hallway.

96
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,085
She crossed between worlds, too.

97
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,463
I saw her in my world before,
and I confirmed it just now.

98
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,341
That's why she was tying me down.

99
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,971
To place herself in the opposition,
with Lee Lim.

100
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,684
But she knows that I found out
about her now. Will it be okay?

101
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,645
Criminals act recklessly
when they're cornered.

102
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,355
That would be great.

103
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,694
If I decide to act recklessly as well,
no one can beat me.

104
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,739
Leave this to me, and just get some rest.

105
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,783
-I want to be with you--
-I know.

106
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,661
Nothing good will happen if I get exposed.

107
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,914
I'll try to be quick,
but I'll probably return tomorrow morning.

108
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,333
I'll be back with Eun-sup.

109
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,051
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

110
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,847
Your Majesty.

111
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,226
KIM JU-HYEON

112
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,396
KIM GI-HWAN

113
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,107
As you can see, there's a scar
that looks like a burn

114
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,569
on the left side of his chest.

115
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,700
Did you say

116
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,244
you've seen that scar before?

117
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,831
Yes.

118
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,757
To be honest, nobody believed me
until now.

119
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,718
I've worked for 11 years,

120
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,889
and I've seen three bodies
with the same scar.

121
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,850
And all on rainy days like today.

122
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,604
But what's strange is that all three

123
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,650
had served terms in prison for parricide.

124
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,944
Those that killed their counterparts

125
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,948
and crossed worlds would get caught easily
by their families.

126
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,577
Please check
if there are any other cases like this.

127
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,789
-I need to find the answer to something.
-Yes.

128
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,012
What is it?

129
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,682
Is it a supplement?

130
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,110
Let go of that.

131
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,362
That's right.

132
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,201
Should I tell you a secret before you die?

133
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,203
His Majesty will arrive soon.

134
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,955
I'll check the premises.

135
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,500
I remember he did something like this.

136
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,347
This beautiful land
With rivers and mountains

137
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,475
Was chosen by Dangun

138
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,603
He built a nation to benefit mankind

139
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,732
There are generations of great people, yo!

140
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,735
King Dongmyeong founded Goguryeo
King Onjo founded Baekje

141
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,237
And Hyeokgeose who was born from an egg

142
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,741
Gwanggaeto the Great rode across Manju

143
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,577
Silla's General Isabu

144
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,123
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm getting discharged tomorrow!

145
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,709
I'll get a good night's sleep
and see you tomorrow.

146
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,086
Die.

147
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,256
You know that song
about the 100 great people of Korea.

148
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,050
It's not actually 100 people.

149
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,449
Great work.

150
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,117
And thank you again.

151
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,829
Open the car door for me next time.

152
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,541
Is the Kingdom going to be okay
without me?

153
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,504
When should Tae-eul and I go?

154
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,172
Maybe tomorrow at dawn.

155
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,345
It's about time she said she'll leave.

156
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,647
Wow, it must be pouring.

157
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,944
Are you all right?

158
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,113
You don't have a scar like a burn
or feel pain?

159
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,865
I'm still in my 20s, you know.

160
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,117
Why would I feel pain when it rains?

161
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,038
So you and Tae-eul don't have it,
but I do.

162
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,791
What do you have?

163
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,711
The mark on those
who've killed their counterparts.

164
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,421
What are...

165
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,466
these cracks?

166
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,524
Mr. Choe is on the special pardons list.
He'll be released on Gyeongchip.

167
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,485
All right.
Get a doctor's appointment for me.

168
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,320
A dermatologist.

169
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,656
Wait, no.

170
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,825
A psychologist?

171
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,120
You didn't see a doctor
while you were off?

172
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,872
Prime Minister.

173
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,084
Why don't you tell me
what you did during vacation?

174
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,426
I guess I like you more than I thought.

175
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,513
You'll be in danger if I tell you.

176
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,810
EOSU BOOKSTORE

177
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,668
You look exactly the same,
so you're definitely not

178
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,171
Lee Lim's hidden son.

179
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,258
You look exactly like
when I saw you in the textbooks.

180
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:29,970
Who are you?

181
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,684
Are you the one who sent me this?

182
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,361
Your parents at least respected me.

183
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,824
They feared me, listened to me,
and kept their heads bowed.

184
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,913
So you're Lee Lim, and not a hidden son?

185
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,874
You have a lot of questions,
so you'll get the answers quickly.

186
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,709
Then you'd be 70 years old.

187
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,878
How is that appearance possible?

188
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,297
And President Trump of the US?

189
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,977
What is this?
Who's she who looks exactly like me?

190
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,063
Which one should I answer first?

191
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,825
As you can see, I'm not dead.

192
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,125
That woman is you in a different world.

193
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,380
Her fingerprints, DNA, appearance,
and birthdate are the same as yours.

194
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,054
There is a parallel world
called the Republic of Korea.

195
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,816
Am I getting blackmailed?

196
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,360
If my answer is wrong,

197
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,158
will that woman replace me?

198
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,875
I've met thousands of people until now,

199
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:28,088
but you're the first one to know
the next step without having to teach you.

200
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,095
What will you do?

201
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,599
Will you try to answer my question?

202
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,488
The men of the Royal Family really know
how to make me laugh.

203
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,242
It's only right for you
to prove your ability first.

204
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,163
Take me to that place.

205
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
The other world.

206
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,504
To the Republic of Korea.

207
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,555
You're the one who chose

208
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,144
where I should go in these heels,
Your Majesty.

209
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:27,981
My guest

210
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,442
wants to go out?

211
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,820
Yes, she asked for a guard
with a big build,

212
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,280
so I sent the best Royal Guard trainee,
Jang Mi-reuk.

213
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,074
And I gave them a business phone.

214
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,288
You really look exactly like Jangmi.

215
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,751
I heard you're the best trainee
of the Royal Guard.

216
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,794
Yes, I am.

217
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,256
Sorry, but how did you know my nickname?

218
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,800
Really?

219
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,010
Is your name Jang Michael?

220
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,595
My name's Jang Mi-reuk.

221
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,392
Even your names are similar.

222
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,477
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

223
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,646
I need to look for a certain place.

224
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,900
It's a snack or bread factory
about an hour's drive away

225
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,320
from this salt field here.

226
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,616
That's a development restricted area,
so there are no factories.

227
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,119
-It's just a forest there.
-Really?

228
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,372
I regained my consciousness
while I was being dragged away,

229
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,959
and I'm sure I smelled something sweet,
like cotton candy.

230
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,045
If so, you've found the right place.

231
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,007
That area is full of cinnamon trees.

232
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,175
Cinnamon trees?

233
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:41,221
Yes, just two trees are enough
to spread a strong sweet scent.

234
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,142
That must be it. Let's go there.

235
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:46,977
What's the number?

236
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,438
She could go with me. Why would she...

237
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,690
She said that you must be very busy

238
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,234
so she'd go there alone.

239
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,071
-Let's go over the urgent matter first.
-There are many,

240
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,199
so let's fix the most urgent one first.

241
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,159
When are you planning to get married?

242
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,953
The nation is buzzing about the queen.

243
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,414
We'll have to make
an official announcement.

244
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,417
-Shall we just do it, or postpone it?
-Postpone it for now.

245
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,961
I haven't received an answer
to my proposal.

246
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,340
Isn't that harsh?

247
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,383
Really?

248
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,928
Stopping Prime Minister Koo
is more urgent.

249
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,513
You should go to the prison

250
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,851
and tell KU Group's Chairman Choe
to send a representative by today.

251
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:33,023
Tell him to make a choice
between his company and his ex-wife,

252
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,902
and I don't want the representative
visiting twice.

253
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,028
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,533
Where's Court Lady Noh?
I haven't seen her.

255
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,371
She's here.

256
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,043
When you're not in my sight,

257
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,338
it's either for a talisman
or something's happened.

258
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,133
Yes, Your Majesty. It's the latter.

259
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,137
Actually, I've caught a spy.

260
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,933
And I got new chickens
during that process.

261
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,895
Someone was using poison?

262
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,116
The spy was a court lady
named Park Suk-jin.

263
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,786
I heard that she had been visiting

264
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,330
the bookstore of the traitors.

265
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,709
She came out of that bookstore
and burned that photo.

266
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,839
When I was revealing her identity,

267
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,717
she suddenly spat out blood.

268
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,305
So his parents were the ones being used.

269
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,350
I still haven't paid him back
for my meal.

270
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,438
How is she? Is she in critical condition?

271
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,190
No, she's conscious now.

272
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:04,364
But she asked to talk to you in person.

273
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,763
You asked to see me?

274
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,807
You've fooled me for such a long time.

275
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,812
I saw you, Your Majesty.

276
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,441
I saw you

277
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,195
with my son, Kang Sin-jae.

278
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,075
It was the last photo
that Lee Lim gave to me.

279
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,370
And with it,

280
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,456
I received the poison.

281
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,253
You haven't fulfilled your role yet.

282
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,176
This will be the last photo
that you receive.

283
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,555
So I gambled.

284
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,392
I drank the poison

285
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,062
instead of poisoning you.

286
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,567
If I died, I'd be paying for my sins,

287
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,195
and if I lived,

288
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,865
I'd talk to you in person like this.

289
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,629
It's shameless of me,

290
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,924
but I'm asking you to decide

291
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,718
the fate of my son.

292
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,267
He didn't do anything wrong.

293
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,520
Please.

294
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,441
Please protect my son, Your Majesty.

295
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,078
Father-in-law, Yu Heung-ik, 510727.

296
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,248
Mother-in-law, Choe Ok-seon, 530305.

297
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,960
Husband Yu Hyeon-jun, 770614.

298
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,005
Sister-in-law Yu Hyeon-seo, 791112.

299
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,472
Your baby must be the luckiest baby
in the Kingdom of Corea.

300
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,185
You're the heir to a fortune
and your husband is a chairman.

301
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,481
I know.

302
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,652
Father-in-law, Yu Heung-ik, 510727.

303
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,697
Mother-in-law, Choe Ok-seon, 530305.

304
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:04,920
What?

305
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,009
What am I doing here?

306
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,264
What am I doing here?

307
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,311
My baby, hang on.

308
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,398
Don't do this.

309
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,449
What happened?

310
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,869
Why am I in a place like this?

311
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,224
What? Is there something in the yard?

312
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,603
What's with you today?

313
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,815
Are you staking out at a club?

314
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,900
Were you heading out or in?

315
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,319
Did you eat? If you didn't, let's eat.

316
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,701
Jeong-hun's mother was really generous
with homemade soybean paste.

317
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,960
Homemade soybean paste is the best.

318
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,753
The soup is amazing.

319
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,010
What is that look?

320
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,014
Are you complaining about your food?
Stop making that face.

321
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,058
I prepared pretty nice side dishes today,
you know.

322
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,816
Dad.

323
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,568
What?

324
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,696
Am I a nice daughter?

325
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:55,947
Of course.

326
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,366
You're nice once a month.

327
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,910
On the 29th. When you receive your salary.

328
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,164
There's one week left.

329
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,918
Put the dishes in the sink after you eat.
I'm leaving now.

330
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,616
It's a Gemini.

331
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,204
That sucks.

332
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,711
Why are you here again?

333
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,714
I have nowhere to go.

334
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,218
You're watching me 24 hours a day.

335
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,470
Where could I go?

336
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,687
I used to work there

337
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,940
when I had Ji-hun.

338
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,828
I'm going to scream.

339
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,205
Should I make people rush over here?

340
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,418
Ms. Min!

341
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,217
Who are you?

342
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,721
Ms. Min, can't you recognize me?

343
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,599
I'm Ji-hun's mom.

344
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,687
Oh my goodness. Right.

345
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,231
It's so nice to run into you here.

346
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,150
My gosh.

347
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,070
I guess things worked out well for you.

348
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,989
How have you been?

349
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,325
Do you still live in that house?

350
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,620
I guess you didn't hear the news.

351
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,955
We moved away
when Sin-jae was in middle school.

352
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,917
To be honest...

353
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,421
I do housekeeping around here.

354
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,222
Ms. Min, let's have a meal together.

355
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,850
A meal?

356
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,938
We ran into each other by coincidence.
We should talk for a bit.

357
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,816
Ms. Min, get in.

358
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,652
Oh, right...

359
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,709
It's amazing

360
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,337
how we ran into each other there.

361
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,966
Do you remember Jong-hun's family?
The bank president.

362
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,175
I work there.

363
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,720
I didn't know if I could do it,

364
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,931
but I think I made a good choice.

365
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,975
I'm helping Sin-jae out, too.

366
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,398
The hospital fees must be overwhelming.

367
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,315
What?

368
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,486
Oh, no. Sin-jae woke up. He's healthy now.

369
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,239
I guess you didn't hear the news
since then.

370
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,077
He regained consciousness?

371
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,163
Yes. One year after the accident.
It was a miracle!

372
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,543
We moved away
because my husband's business failed.

373
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,675
Look.

374
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,595
Sin-jae became a cop.

375
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,974
Nobody would believe me now
if I tell them he was sick like that.

376
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,280
Come to think of it, Ji-hun
and Sin-jae were the same age, right?

377
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,781
How is Ji-hun?

378
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,869
Ms. Min.

379
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,831
It was so nice to see you today.

380
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,793
I thought of you sometimes.

381
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,797
You were really kind to me,

382
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,634
so I was grateful.

383
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,806
Here.

384
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,728
Buy yourself something delicious.

385
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,939
Oh my goodness.

386
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,359
I'll be off now.

387
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,653
Oh, gosh. Wait.

388
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,696
Hang on!

389
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,365
My gosh.

390
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,700
Wait!

391
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,497
What is this? My goodness.

392
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,809
-Which floor are you going to?
-The same floor.

393
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,578
That jerk.

394
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,624
You said you were almost here
a long time ago. But you're not here.

395
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,626
Hurry up!

396
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,170
Carry her on your back.

397
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,138
The guards are to wait here.

398
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,061
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

399
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,441
I was worried.

400
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,193
I heard you took
a guard with you somewhere.

401
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,698
-Why didn't you pick up?
-I didn't even have the chance.

402
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,325
That man's phone was ringing
like a thousand times.

403
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,495
I brought a guard with me
so you wouldn't worry so much.

404
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,249
Let's go somewhere quiet, though.

405
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,376
I have something to tell you.

406
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,923
I think I'm about to find
Lee Lim's bamboo forest.

407
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,473
I remembered something about that day,

408
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,975
and I found the forest where I woke up.

409
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,771
The Jangmi in this world is going to
look for a bamboo forest nearby.

410
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,732
If we find it,
you just have to keep watch there.

411
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,616
What is it? Am I wrong?

412
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,701
The moment that door opens,

413
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,287
time stops.

414
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,751
And it stops

415
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,463
for a longer time each time it opens.

416
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,967
Now, time stops for over an hour.

417
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:02,100
So if you keep men there,
they'll be in danger.

418
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,602
Since only Lee Lim would be moving.

419
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,525
Right. I guess
you would've thought of that already.

420
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:16,114
Time really stops for that long?

421
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,046
Then you'd be alone during that time.

422
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,345
You were with me

423
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,265
a couple of times.

424
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,060
Is there even a way for us

425
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,855
to fix this?

426
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,779
I think time is stopping
because the Manpasikjeok is split in half.

427
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,159
Only half its power is being used,
so the dimensions are falling apart.

428
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,536
Maybe

429
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,957
if it's whole again,
things might get better.

430
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,086
How would it be whole again?

431
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,464
It'll be either of the two things.

432
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,009
You take the piece Lee Lim has,

433
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,012
or he takes yours.

434
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:25,183
Or if I stop Lee Lim
before he takes half of the Manpasikjeok.

435
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,061
But that's in the past.

436
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,898
If there's a time axis in there
as well as a space axis,

437
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,025
then it'll be possible.

438
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:39,030
It'll explain how I got your ID card
25 years ago.

439
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,908
Does it exist?

440
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,284
I'm not sure yet.

441
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,287
I've ridden across that place,

442
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,707
but no matter how long I rode,
I couldn't reach the edge.

443
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,128
I'm sure about one thing, though.
I tossed a coin in the air,

444
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:55,922
and it floated.

445
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,716
Your seeds sank in there.

446
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,470
I think living things sink.

447
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,015
Really?

448
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,979
I bought more flower seeds today.

449
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,232
MAGIC LILY

450
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,071
Do you really believe

451
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,823
that flowers will bloom there?

452
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,828
I know what you're concerned about.

453
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,623
If the Manpasikjeok becomes one,

454
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,460
that door might close forever.

455
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,171
Right?

456
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,883
This is the 10th rule out of the 17.

457
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,386
Don't get scared in advance.

458
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,597
It hasn't even happened yet.

459
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,315
You're right.

460
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,902
But it's the 9th out of the 17.

461
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,613
Oh, it's the ninth?

462
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,201
You say it as if you've followed
the first eight rules.

463
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,955
In this situation,
you should just give me a pat...

464
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,375
Never mind. I'll see you at dawn.

465
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,047
Guards, take one step forward.

466
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,223
Let's watch dawn breaking together.

467
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,059
What boyfriend says that
to stay with his girlfriend?

468
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,770
-What else would I say, then?
-You should say it sincerely.

469
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,939
I guess I said it with something else.

470
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,191
-What did you say it with?
-With impatience.

471
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,854
Wow.

472
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,245
Damn it, bring your own next time.

473
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,663
You're being so cheap.

474
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,040
Damn it.

475
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,296
Hey, kids!

476
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,173
You can't smoke here.

477
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,969
How can you do such an awful thing
in broad daylight?

478
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,846
Should we smoke elsewhere?

479
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,976
When an adult says that,
it means you should stop.

480
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,770
Or I'll make you stop.

481
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,190
Why don't you try?

482
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,827
I can tell by your faces
that you'll become gangsters or cops.

483
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,996
Here, take these.

484
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,255
MANY COPS LEARNED HERE
AT HERO TAEKWONDO CENTER

485
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,383
-Don't be ridiculous. You're lying.
-He's not lying.

486
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,720
Did you get off already?

487
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,224
Dad.

488
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,812
Dad.

489
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,232
I almost got killed this time.

490
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,735
You were worried this time
when I wasn't home, right?

491
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:51,115
But you were home every day.
You even messaged me often.

492
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,617
Are you drunk?

493
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,761
What? What is it?

494
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,096
Give me your phone.

495
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,764
Why?

496
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,727
What's going on?

497
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,312
Huh?

498
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:32,364
Didn't Gon give you any money?
Why are you mooching off a civil servant?

499
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,285
I learned it from Lieutenant Jeong.

500
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,661
This is really nice.

501
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,459
But...

502
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,672
KIM GI-HWAN, KANG HYEON-MIN

503
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,299
KANG HYEON-MIN

504
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,469
Who is Kang Hyeon-min?

505
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,266
Is it okay to drink when you got shot?

506
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,230
I get hurt when I protect people,
and I protect people when I get hurt.

507
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,691
-You're so cocky.
-That's how you should fight every battle.

508
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,486
You still haven't answered me.

509
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,242
Was your name Kang Hyeon-min
in the Kingdom of Corea?

510
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,165
Yes, I think so.

511
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,751
Will you look it up for me?

512
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,047
Anything else you want to know?

513
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,717
Or anything you want to find.

514
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,060
Like your mother.

515
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,273
Anyone.

516
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,109
My mother, or my siblings.

517
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,737
-You wanted to see me for that?
-Why aren't you telling her?

518
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,075
You have feelings for Lieutenant Jeong.

519
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,078
I'm sure you know when even I know it.

520
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,587
I guess this is why you get shot.
I'll shoot you too next time.

521
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,966
His Majesty and Lieutenant Jeong
can't be together.

522
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,052
The two worlds are too far apart.

523
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,434
That's more the reason
for you to be quiet.

524
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,438
There are people more distant
than that even in the same world.

525
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,899
Leaving like that means it's true.

526
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,322
Yes, it's true.

527
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,268
You're here on your vacation?

528
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,189
Why won't you answer your phone?
What have you been up to?

529
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,032
How did you get here?

530
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,207
Are you okay? Are you sick?

531
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,425
What did you just...

532
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,516
It's my dad. Hang on.

533
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,122
Sin-jae!

534
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,582
There you are.

535
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,919
My phone's location
is around here somewhere.

536
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,422
Tae-eul.

537
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,386
Did you...

538
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,101
You saw her, right? Me. I mean,

539
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,769
my counterpart.

540
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,730
Did you meet her?

541
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,024
Did you arrive just now?

542
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,818
Yes.

543
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:43,365
Is it true? Does she look exactly like me?

544
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,371
She even has my cell phone.

545
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,167
She has your ID card, too.
She applied for a vacation.

546
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,670
Go to the station first
and cancel your vacation.

547
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,351
So that's where the ID card is.

548
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,195
She's picking up?

549
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,117
-You know who I am, don't you?
-Of course.

550
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,621
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

551
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,709
Where are you now?
We should see each other.

552
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,836
You came here to see me.

553
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,047
You shouldn't say such a thing.

554
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,634
If you see me now, you die.

555
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,887
Be grateful you didn't run into me.

556
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,140
If you ever touch anyone around me--

557
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,727
If I was planning on that,
I would've done it while you were away.

558
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,981
I came here to see you. I'll see you soon.
Thanks for the phone.

559
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,491
The number you have dialed is currently--

560
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,246
So it's me you're after.

561
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,253
Even her voice was exactly the same
as mine, though.

562
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,967
Have you been well?

563
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,303
Did you eat well?

564
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,097
Did nothing happen?

565
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,392
Did you run into Prime Minister Koo?

566
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,895
How did you know that?

567
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,776
I saw that she had the same scar
that I have on my shoulder.

568
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,737
But don't worry about her.

569
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,282
She'll never be able to go
where she wants.

570
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,909
I've only tied her down

571
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,871
but she'll feel
as if she's lost her wings.

572
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,041
It's been six years, Your Majesty.

573
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,710
Have you been well?

574
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,712
I remember you.

575
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,048
We met
at the former prime minister's office.

576
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,427
I see you're here today
as Mr. Choe's representative.

577
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:13,557
People call me a lobbyist,
but I call myself a laborer.

578
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,560
I get dirt on my hands
so that the higher-ups

579
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,812
don't get their hands dirty.

580
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,525
And you can use me for that this time.

581
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,360
Shall I?

582
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,113
Let's hear his decision first.

583
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,116
Chairman Choe always puts
his company first.

584
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,621
He gave plenty of alimony to his ex-wife.

585
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,920
This is his answer.

586
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,430
It's treason, Your Majesty.

587
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,103
I expected it, but KU really has it all.

588
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,148
But what's more shocking
is that the evidence

589
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,609
came from her private residence.

590
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,446
You should increase security
in the palace.

591
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,824
Your voice was recorded often, too.

592
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,703
You said you can never be indebted to her.

593
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,376
I guess I didn't know her that well.

594
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,794
Breaking news.

595
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:27,089
SBC has just received a voice recording
of KU Group's chairman,

596
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,007
Choe Min-hwan, and his ex-wife,

597
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,219
Prime Minister Koo Seo-ryeong.

598
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,179
Let's hear the file first.

599
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:38,016
Find the ones who participated
in the treason 25 years ago.

600
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,812
If rumors spread about me trying
to catch those traitors

601
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,357
a year before my term ends,
I'll be finished.

602
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,694
All the videos of the scene
are completely gone.

603
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,529
Even from foreign servers.

604
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,781
Can KU find them?

605
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,742
Is your secretary's office
actually that capable?

606
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,035
My goodness.

607
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:10,048
THE CHAIRMAN OF KU SAVES THE COMPANY
BY EXPOSING HIS EX-WIFE

608
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,470
You can't, Deputy Prime Minister.
Let me talk to her first!

609
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,270
Prime Minister Koo, you are to cease
all duties from this moment on.

610
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,355
While you're excluded from duties,

611
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,275
I will work in your place
as deputy prime minister.

612
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,402
Please return your business phone.

613
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,113
And put your belongings in this box.

614
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,990
Who gave the order?

615
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,120
KU? Or the opposition party?

616
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,081
The Royal Court?

617
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,004
Were all of you this close?

618
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,550
-Hand it to me.
-It's fine. I have nothing to take.

619
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,386
Here.

620
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,598
I only need this.

621
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,152
Aren't you coming?

622
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,238
My place is always here.

623
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,582
I knew men were just all talk
about being loyal,

624
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,752
but you are ridiculous.

625
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,465
Who went through
my private residence, and when?

626
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,468
You've spilled the milk.

627
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,639
You should be the one to clean it up.

628
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,974
Fine.

629
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,187
Stay in your place
for as long as you like.

630
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,982
I never stayed in my place.

631
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,568
I was always soaring higher.

632
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,322
Let's go.

633
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,537
Are you going to ignore me, too?

634
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,541
No. Let's go.

635
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,676
Prime Minister Koo cracked
palace security.

636
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,140
You can ask her how yourself.
I don't want to talk about it.

637
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,438
This place still has the best food.

638
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,234
By the way, how did you know I was here?

639
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,779
Did you install a tracking app
on Eun-sup's phone?

640
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,531
No, he downloaded it on my phone.

641
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,784
Did his siblings find out you weren't him?

642
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,496
Of course not.

643
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,629
Eun-bi. Did you know
Eun-sup's got a driver's license?

644
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,634
-That guy isn't my brother.
-Right? It's strange, right?

645
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,179
Of course, you'd notice.

646
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,556
Eun-bi, listen.

647
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,142
Eun-sup!

648
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,312
My little puppies! Hey!

649
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,232
She just said he wasn't her brother.
Hey, Eun-bi!

650
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,943
You just said he wasn't your brother.

651
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,778
This one is.

652
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,155
What do you mean?

653
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:21,740
Why is he...

654
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,327
It feels like he is.

655
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:29,122
Na-ri, it seems like you really missed me.

656
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,667
I really missed you!

657
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,129
Didn't you see me yesterday?

658
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,340
What are you doing?
There are kids watching.

659
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,222
All the reasons for not trading places
with him are here.

660
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,099
Come here!

661
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,435
Who

662
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,854
would be so brave

663
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,190
as to steal a cop's phone?

664
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,362
Are you sure it was stolen?
Service was canceled just now.

665
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,655
-Canceled?
-Yes.

666
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,282
It says you canceled it yourself.

667
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,119
Gosh, that means
I can't even use my phone now.

668
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,871
I'll be off, then.

669
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,999
I need to get a new phone.

670
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:17,837
Cheer up.

671
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,384
04D 7283

672
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,898
I thought it was Na-ri.

673
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,402
What? Did you miss me already?

674
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,199
You wanted me to open the door.

675
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,452
Seriously?

676
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,370
Where's Yeong? Ask him to drive you.

677
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,205
This is the Republic of Korea.

678
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,875
I tried to buy the company but I failed.

679
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,960
I don't have an ID here.

680
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:43,173
So, I've bought you this for now.
You can drive it yourself

681
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,716
since it's yours.

682
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,385
What are you saying?

683
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,390
This car is mine?

684
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,772
Yeong's got a driving license now.

685
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,274
I thank you

686
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,277
sincerely for your service.

687
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,742
Is this for real?

688
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,620
But...

689
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,082
I don't have anything to give you
in return.

690
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,209
This will do.

691
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,630
I was wondering
since you had it all the time.

692
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,052
If you told me,
I would have brought you the whole box.

693
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,805
It'll boost your stamina.

694
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,641
I look forward to it.

695
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,144
I'd love to stay and watch you drive,
but I must go now.

696
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,522
Take good care of the car.

697
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,190
Goodbye.

698
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,405
He looks so cool even when he's leaving.

699
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,324
Sir, yes, sir!

700
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,081
Dad, I'm going to be late today
so make sure to lock the door.

701
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,083
Don't open it for anyone.

702
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,335
Especially for people you know.

703
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,171
-Are you going to work on a Sunday?
-Yes.

704
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,259
I put your phone on the table,
so call me if something comes up.

705
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,096
I'll call if I want to. Eat up.

706
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,556
Thank you.

707
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,113
Oh, the horse owner came.
It's been a while.

708
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,657
So I asked him to join.

709
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,577
Go on, you said you're leaving.

710
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,121
Well, it's...

711
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,585
Isn't that the pork I bought?

712
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,046
Hey, you've been living
in my house for 30 years!

713
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,675
What did you put on your face?

714
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,178
Your skin is glowing.

715
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,305
Did you get a boyfriend?

716
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,225
Don't be ridiculous.
This is my bare face…

717
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,148
Yes.

718
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,443
-What?
-I got a boyfriend.

719
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,321
-He's here.
-What?

720
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,294
I wanted that announcement
to be sweet and emotional,

721
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,795
but I guess it's too late.

722
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,089
But the point is the same either way.

723
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,175
I like your daughter a lot.

724
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,429
I'm Lee Gon. Nice to meet you, sir.

725
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,808
I'm just so startled...

726
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,897
Gosh, Dad. The meat is all cooked.

727
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,691
Right. Yes, it's all cooked.

728
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,070
It's hot, so the meat is cooked.

729
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,863
Oh, sit back down.

730
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,325
Eat up. Enjoy your food.

731
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,493
Here you go.

732
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,081
You like wrapping stuff.

733
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,505
Did you bring it from my world?

734
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,799
It tastes just like the palace's kimchi.

735
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,384
By the way...

736
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,887
Well, I've been wanting to ask...

737
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,848
Who really are you?

738
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,352
Dad.

739
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,271
Can't you just tell?

740
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,232
You can tell just by looking at his face.

741
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,109
He's a decent guy.

742
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,366
I think your father was pretty shocked.

743
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,829
He went through so much to raise you,
but you're seeing a guy with no identity.

744
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,956
I was thinking of seeing you tonight.

745
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,333
I didn't know you'd come home.

746
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,712
I have to go check
where Koo Seo-ryeong went, though.

747
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:55,425
I thought I could end up leaving
without saying goodbye.

748
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,970
You're leaving today?

749
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:02,974
Right now?

750
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,729
Should I stay?

751
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,481
Should I stay

752
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,109
just for today?

753
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,363
If I stop you, will you stay?

754
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,074
Are you sincere?

755
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,369
I'll see you when I'm done.

756
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,048
I bought this a long time ago.

757
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,717
I bought it thinking

758
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,179
I might use it as an excuse
to stop you from leaving.

759
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,475
I just bought something dark.

760
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,603
Something people can't recognize you with.

761
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,272
You didn't seem to have plain clothes.

762
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,525
They won't look plain if I wear them.

763
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,946
Thank you, it'll look good on me.

764
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,074
It shouldn't look that good on you.

765
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,533
I told you it's impossible.

766
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,542
But this...

767
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,672
It feels like I've seen this before.

768
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,633
Yes, that's the kind of thing
I was going for.

769
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,095
Wear it. I'll see you in it later.
And pick up when I call.

770
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:32,230
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD THREE

771
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,867
Sin-jae, I have a favor to ask.

772
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,452
Can you help me?

773
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,000
-Are you going to look for her?
-She'll come to me soon.

774
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,752
There's something more urgent.

775
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,798
Ms. Koo Eun-a.

776
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,352
Looks like she wasn't in
for at least 4 days.

777
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,855
That's why we need to find her.

778
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,734
There's no way Koo Seo-ryeong
would have not visited her here.

779
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:22,238
And if she did,
she wouldn't have done nothing.

780
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,909
It must be about the fingerprints.

781
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,370
Yes, this is Sin-jae.

782
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,330
Hey, Jangmi.

783
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,667
-Right.
-All right. Thank you.

784
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,965
I'll come soon.

785
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,344
Koo Eun-a

786
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,264
was reported missing today.

787
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,727
We got the fingerprint results.

788
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,522
He has a criminal record.

789
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,193
He served three years
for robbing a care home 19 years ago,

790
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,112
and that was the Yangsun Care Center.

791
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,408
That's where Lee Seong-jae died.

792
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,452
Lee Lim's counterpart.

793
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,705
If Koo Seo-ryeong came here with Lee Lim,

794
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,416
and if Koo Eun-a is dead
and not just missing...

795
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,587
She's at Yangsun Care Center.

796
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,761
You know her, right?

797
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,139
No, I don't.

798
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,517
May I take a look around, then?

799
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,144
No. Do you have a warrant?

800
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,272
No. You can just report me.

801
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,942
Why are there so many rooms
that require ID cards?

802
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,241
It's that, right?

803
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,743
I'll borrow this.

804
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,995
-Take the evens. I'll check the odds.
-Okay.

805
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,521
You have no unfinished business here?

806
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,566
No. I planned to come and go
like I was never here.

807
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:23,901
What is that?

808
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,408
Someone didn't want me to attract
anyone's attention in this world.

809
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:39,584
Your Majesty.

810
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,587
Would you like a drink with me?

811
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:46,591
A drink?

812
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,218
Something on your mind?

813
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,431
I'll be back soon.
There's no soju in the fridge.

814
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,267
Lieutenant Jeong taught me,
and it was good.

815
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,499
He didn't do anything wrong.

816
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,878
Please.

817

TAE-EUL'S SO-CALLED BROTHER

01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,435
The number you have dialed is--

819
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,376
Everything is black.

820
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,634
What? Did you forget the key?

821
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,851
I didn't think you'd be here so early.
Did you skip work?

822
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,564
It's all part of my skills. Can I come in?

823
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,749
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

825
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,222
What about Jo Yeong?
It'll be nice to drink together.

826
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:27,812
I looked up how to grow a magic lily.

827
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:29,855
I wanted to grow some.

828
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,359
But it says it's really hard to grow them.

829
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,153
Do you know what it symbolizes?

830
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,535
It's "hopeless love."

831
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,420
What's with that look?

832
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,048
I thought I wouldn't be fooled,

833
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,261
but that face is my one weakness.

834
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,682
What do you mean?

835
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,684
You have a look of anxiety.

836
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,062
Something that Tae-eul doesn't have.
You're not…

837
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,731
Jeong Tae-eul.

838
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,833
JEONG TAE-EUL

839
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,002
You must be Luna.

840
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,037
So that's what happened.

841
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,664
He was tall...

842
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:13,584
He was skilled with a gun,

843
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,712
knew the structure
of the Cheonjongo well...

844
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:19,340
He clearly knew who the enemy was.

845
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:25,387
He was fighting with all his might for me.

846
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,681
The one who saved me...

847
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,978
The one who saved you was yourself.

848
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:37,900
It was me.

849
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:44,949
So that's how…

850
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,037
everything comes together.

851
