PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 14

4
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,813
Sin-jae, I found Koo Eun-a.
The freezer on the second basement floor.

5
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,939
Okay, I'm coming.

6
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,093
Sin-jae.

7
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,951
His Majesty has such an exquisite face,

8
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,704
so I reduced the saturation
of the royal robe.

9
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,292
And the light in Gwangyeongjeon
showcases the splendidness of the crown

10
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,254
-as well as His Majesty's radiant face.
-How far did you go?

11
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:06,853
Are you headed toward that perilous night?

12
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:20,491
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

13
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,963
If you're looking for the whip,
you're wasting your time.

14
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,799
You've got to give up one or the other,
Your Majesty.

15
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,928
It's either your whip or your life.

16
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,308
It's Lee Lim
who wants to take Your Majesty's life,

17
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,478
and what I want is the whip.

18
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,566
Nothing here is mine to begin with,

19
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,319
so I'll settle with the whip.

20
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,379
Get her.

21
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,838
You come first.

22
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,054
Get the whip first.

23
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,100
The gray coat in the closet.
The eighth one.

24
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,060
The inside pocket.

25
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,272
Detective Jeong, it's me.

26
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,817
His Majesty has been poisoned.
He needs to be treated at once.

27
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,902
How is he?

28
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,155
I'm out of town at the moment.
I'll call you right back.

29
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,158
I'll have someone call you.
Follow his instructions.

30
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,580
Ms. Kim.

31
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,376
There's an emergency poisoned case.

32
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,130
But he's an unregistered resident,
so he can't go to the hospital.

33
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,173
Please help him.

34
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,263
Hang in there.

35
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,557
Please hang in there.

36
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,351
Eun-sup, you should wait here.

37
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,794
EMERGENCY BELL

38
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,020
You're that detective
from the other day, right?

39
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,773
Carrying two cell phones...

40
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,442
I thought he looked like you.

41
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,363
He's your family, right?

42
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,991
What are you doing here?

43
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,662
It turns out that my husband
had a good friend I didn't know about.

44
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,083
He paid off our debt for us

45
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,336
and even got me a job here.

46
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,759
Have any other family members visited?

47
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,052
No, no one.

48
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,556
I was told to tell whichever family member
that comes to answer the phone.

49
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,767
Someone will call you.

50
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,323
He's not out yet?

51
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,081
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes, he was poisoned.

52
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,377
But thankfully, we could save him
because Eun-sup acted speedily.

53
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,921
He'll wake up soon,
so don't worry too much.

54
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,466
Who is he?
Why can't he go to the hospital?

55
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,260
And why is he unregistered?

56
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,681
I'm sorry.
I'll explain everything later on.

57
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,727
Does this have to be kept
from Chief Park too?

58
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,063
Yes, I'm sorry.

59
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,232
All right.

60
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,569
This is my friend's clinic,
so he can only stay during the weekend.

61
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,570
-That's it.
-Okay.

62
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,489
Thank you. Thank you so much.

63
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,411
You cannot go in.

64
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,872
The person who poisoned His Majesty

65
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,833
looked exactly like you.

66
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,752
There's no guarantee that you're not her.

67
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,328
Eun-sup, it's me.

68
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,416
Take Eun-bi and Kka-bi and go to my place.

69
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:27,298
My dad, Eun-bi, Kka-bi, and you
should stay there together.

70
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,596
If I come home, call me right away.

71
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,057
Got it?

72
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,643
What do you mean?
Why should I call you when you--

73
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,024
Is this what I think it is?

74
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,776
Yes, it is.

75
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,696
I'm counting on you.

76
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,542
How did you end up at that point in time?

77
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,961
How did you manage to find me

78
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,505
at that moment in time and stop me?

79
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,331
Your Majesty.

80
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,583
Are you all right?

81
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,090
You got through it.

82
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,059
Does Lieutenant Jeong know about this too?

83
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,898
She did stop by.

84
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,151
Yeong.

85
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,781
-You were probably mean to her.
-Your Majesty.

86
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,033
We must return to the palace.

87
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,702
I can't protect you in this world.

88
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,329
Can we go back to that?

89
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,082
That thing you were going to tell
over a drink.

90
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,917
What was it about?

91
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,468
I got flustered
because of what happened to you,

92
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,096
so I forgot.

93
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,974
I don't buy that.

94
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,732
If you need more time to think,

95
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,320
-I'll hear it when I'm back.
-You need more rest.

96
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,533
Tell Lieutenant Jeong
that I'm sorry for leaving without a word.

97
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,911
And I want you to protect her

98
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,956
until I return.

99
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,499
-Your Majesty.
-Yeong.

100
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,547
It was me who saved myself.

101
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,176
And today must be the day.

102
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,763
I started hearing the flute I heard

103
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,101
on the night of the treason.

104
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:17,898
It's Lee Lim.

105
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,775
Is that you, my dear nephew?

106
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,875
Did you know?

107
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,253
When the Manpasikjeok becomes one
inside the gate,

108
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,299
both the axes for time and space
simultaneously form inside the gate.

109
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,511
When the Manpasikjeok becomes whole,

110
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,806
it takes you to the moment
when you wish to save yourself.

111
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,437
So where were the two of them taken
from there?

112
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:01,609
Both the king and the traitor were taken
to the same point in time.

113
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,153
The night of the treason.

114
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,572
Why?

115
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,284
Because the king wished
to save both worlds from the traitor,

116
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,660
1 HOUR BEFORE THE COUP

117
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:16,874
and the traitor wished to save
his foolish self from failing the coup.

118
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,312
What is this?

119
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,273
Who are you?

120
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,027
You've been dreaming
of staging a coup here every single night

121
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,279
under your dim-witted father

122
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,909
and your younger brother who became king
just because he's the legitimate son.

123
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,828
Hence, I came to save you.

124
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,791
To be more exact,
I came to save my foolish self.

125
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,834
Who are you?

126
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,754
Why do you look exactly like me?

127
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,172
Can't you tell?

128
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,257
I'm you.

129
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,510
You from the year 2020.

130
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,555
You're from the year 2020?

131
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,517
I'd be 70 years old

132
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,019
in 2020.

133
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,940
You already know the answer.
That's what I realized, looking back.

134
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,859
And that's why you staged the coup.

135
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,244
That must be it.

136
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,581
The secret of the Manpasikjeok
must be true.

137
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,046
The other world actually exists.

138
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,716
Do you believe me now?

139
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,552
Then I'll show you a shortcut.

140
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,763
You should head
to the crown prince's chambers

141
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,181
instead of Cheonjongo.

142
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,891
Kill the crown prince first.

143
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,602
If his past perishes,
his future will be no more.

144
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,648
The crown prince is the one
who puts a stop to this coup.

145
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,609
You mean, the eight-year-old boy
who is sleeping

146
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,070
to a lullaby at the moment?

147
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,784
That's what I thought
and I only got half of the Manpasikjeok.

148
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,787
So just do as I say.

149
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,207
Slay the crown prince
and bring the whole Manpasikjeok.

150
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,961
If I come to possess it,
that means it will be yours too.

151
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,840
So in other words,

152
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,218
you failed.

153
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,642
You are none the wiser despite your age.

154
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,148
Or should I say that "I" am?

155
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,109
If you're actually me,

156
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,988
you should be keeping your sword here.

157
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,047
I will carry out the coup, not you.

158
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,011
And I will come into possession
of the whole Manpasikjeok, not you.

159
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,645
So, the traitor failed to save himself.

160
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,357
Instead, he created the monster
that he is today.

161
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,737
You're telling the story
as if you've seen it.

162
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,450
By the way, who are you?

163
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,661
Do you live around here?

164
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,497
I warn people of danger

165
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,584
and defeat the enemy.

166
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:34,631
I also want to save myself
and become whole.

167
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,135
Your story is interesting. So?

168
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,471
What happened to the king?

169
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,807
He's following his destiny.

170
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,729
Will he return safe and sound
without getting lost?

171
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,566
The Manpasikjeok is powerless when halved.

172
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,860
Your Highness!

173
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,387
Your Highness, we've lost too much time.

174
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,472
-You need to get out of here.
-Wait.

175
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,016
There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.

176
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,436
Sir, you won't be able to escape
once the Royal Guards get here.

177
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,030
Let's go.

178
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,199
We're going to leave right now!

179
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,776
Emergency alert.

180
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,820
All Royal Guards,
gear up and gather at Cheonjongo.

181
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,569
Identify yourself.
Are you one of the traitor's followers?

182
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,280
You...

183
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,492
saw me that day?

184
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,247
You won't believe me, but I am your king.

185
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,958
You are my king? How dare you!

186
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,595
I am

187
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,433
deeply indebted to you.

188
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,104
And as you advised,

189
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,775
I am following my destiny.

190
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,987
So please

191
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,073
just let me go.

192
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,200
Please.

193
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,752
But...

194
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,447
You shouldn't be wasting your time on me.

195
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,242
The traitor's followers,
Sub-captain Yoo of the Royal Guards,

196
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,536
Kim Gi-hwan, Noh Min-ho, Lee Cheol-jin,

197
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,289
Kang Hyeong-uk, and Choi Sang-min
are with Lee Lim.

198
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:04,002
You're coming from the secondary palace,
meaning they are headed to the rear gate.

199
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,421
Who are you? Identify yourself.

200
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,677
Drop your guns.

201
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,399
I'm sorry.

202
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:58,848
Seung-heon.

203
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,600
Gon.

204
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,061
Hey.

205
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,230
Who are you?

206
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,191
You're not the Royal Guards.

207
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,235
Identify yourself.

208
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,989
If you're a straggler,
you don't need to do this.

209
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,661
Lee Seung-heon,

210
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,330
it was you.

211
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,793
You were the one who helped
Lee Lim escape.

212
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,630
Because of you,
Lee Lim managed to escape the palace

213
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,175
and arrived in the Republic of Korea.

214
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,468
Who are you?

215
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,793
Hello?

216
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,253
It's me.

217
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,466
His Majesty left.

218
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,719
He asked me to tell you

219
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,222
that he's sorry he had to leave
without even saying goodbye.

220
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,260
Hi, Mom. I have a question for you.

221
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,637
It's about Dad.

222
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,600
Did he run a care center by any chance?
Before he ended up in jail.

223
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,572
What's gotten into you?
You never visited me.

224
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,495
It was you, right?

225
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,958
You turned Kang Hyeon-min
into Kang Sin-jae.

226
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,879
Did you meet him?

227
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,718
You met that man, didn't you?

228
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,555
That's why I was chosen?

229
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,017
Because Lee Lim needed a care center.

230
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,103
And the freezer.

231
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,399
What did he say? Will he take you there?

232
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:56,943
What about me?

233
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,612
He said nothing about me?

234
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,325
Just tell me what happened.

235
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,545
We were told Sin-jae wouldn't wake up,

236
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,090
and his mom was utterly devastated.

237
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,801
But that man

238
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,305
showed me a photo of you.

239
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,101
He said he'd hand you over

240
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,938
as a bonus
if I sold the care center to him.

241
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:37,942
Tell him

242
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:39,903
to visit me

243
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,864
just once.

244
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,492
Just once.

245
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:28,535
Sin-jae, you're a miracle to me.

246
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,321
1994 NEW RELEASE
BEEPER VOICEMAIL SERVICE

247
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,503
DECEMBER 20, 1994

248
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,017
DECEMBER 22, 1994

249
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,187
The time axis can only be formed

250
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,398
when the Manpasikjeok becomes whole.

251
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,444
With only half of it,
I can only move laterally.

252
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,865
I have to travel through 26 years
to get to 2020.

253
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,495
That's roughly four months
inside the inter-dimensional gate.

254
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,750
My gosh.

255
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,223
Do I exist in this world?

256
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,144
No, not anymore.
He died when he was eight.

257
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,568
DIAL 112 TO REPORT A CRIME

258
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,035
This is the police. How may we help you?

259
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,414
Lee Seong-jae.
Date of birth, February 27, 1951.

260
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,166
Lee Eun-ho.
Date of birth, October 23, 1952.

261
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,378
Lee Ji-hun.
Date of birth, October 28, 1987.

262
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,214
Song Jeong-hye.
Date of birth, August 8, 1965.

263
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,091
Find that family.

264
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,344
All of them will die,
except for Song Jeong-hye.

265
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,223
Oh, okay. You're filing a report, right?

266
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,184
What's your name, sir?

267
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,230
Please look into it immediately.

268
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,692
-They might already be dead.
-Just a moment.

269
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,819
What?

270
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:55,199
"Lee Ji-hun, born on October 28, 1987.
Died due to lost footing at Paldang Lake."

271
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,660
This must be it from this morning.

272
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,748
Hello? I'm sorry, but where are you now?

273
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,209
So

274
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,088
it already happened.

275
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,928
-Has the perpetrator been caught?
-Please don't hang up.

276
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,931
How did you find out about this?

277
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,975
Are you calling from a pay phone?

278
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,234
PAY PHONE

279
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,261
You looked good in the navy uniform.

280
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,724
-You're the only woman in my life.
-You have quite a wit.

281
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,716
AHN BONG-HUI

282
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,006
Jeong Tae-eul?

283
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,427
Who are you? How do you know my name?

284
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,098
You're actually five years old.

285
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:27,977
I'm...

286
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,231
from a different time.

287
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,235
I ended up in 1994,

288
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,282
so I have to travel through 26 years.

289
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,785
I'll be there soon.

290
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,040
I am on my way to you.

291
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,418
I think I know who you are.

292
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,296
You know who I am?

293
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,423
You're a kidnapper.

294
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,184
Your personality hasn't changed
in the past 30 years,

295
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,394
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

296
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,444
-Who might you be?
-I'm Instructor Jeong's acquaintance.

297
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,113
Please accept my deepest condolences.

298
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,589
Bye.

299
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:11,122
JEONG TAE-EUL

300
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,553
Why aren't you sprouting?

301
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,431
It's spring now.

302
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,856
What's taking you so long?

303
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,204
FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

304
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,124
Hey.

305
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,960
I stumbled upon something very strange.

306
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,381
This fine voice sounds very familiar.
Give it a listen.

307
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,553
Lee Seong-jae.
Date of birth, February 27, 1951.

308
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,431
Lee Eun-ho.
Date of birth, October 23, 1952.

309
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,476
Lee Ji-hun.
Date of birth, October 28, 1987.

310
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,979
What is this? Where did you get this?

311
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,148
It's that guy, right?

312
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,569
That handsome watermark.
Does this make sense though?

313
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,031
There's a record of him
calling and filing a report in 1994.

314
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,616
It wasn't there last time.

315
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,118
The intel you were after...

316
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,955
This guy is the suspect
in the death of that family.

317
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,834
I'm from a different time.
Jeong Tae-eul?

318
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,920
I ended up in 1994.

319
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,925
I'll be there soon. I am on my way

320
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,302
to you.

321
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,224
I have

322
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,560
new memories.

323
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,482
I remember everything.

324
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,860
When I was five,

325
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,031
he came to see me.

326
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,159
He was over there...

327
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,000
Wait, 1994?

328
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,378
The coup took place

329
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,880
in 1994.

330
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,216
He went back to that night.

331
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,762
Then he came to the Republic of Korea
that night.

332
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,100
He's...

333
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,520
in the past now.

334
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,223
How far have you come?

335
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,313
Where should I wait for you?

336
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,722
Thank you for your help.

337
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,392
You said he's your twin brother.

338
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,686
It's a lie, isn't it?

339
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,609
The stories you've been telling me
weren't about a dream.

340
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,240
I really was a quack.

341
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,996
Which one of you is Sin-jae?
And which one is Hyeon-min?

342
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,627
I'm trying to find out.

343
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,145
KIND CIVIL POLICE
BY THE CITIZENS' SIDE

344
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,063
Tae-eul!

345
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,942
We got the footage that shows

346
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,486
routes of the vehicles
that visited the care center.

347
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,404
Okay.

348
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,116
What's going on?
Are you looking for someone?

349
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,742
No, don't mind me.

350
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:03,664
Gosh, it looks like we'll have to pull
three all-nighters in a row.

351
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,749
I'll get it down to two.

352
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,763
I received some of them via cloud.

353
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,975
I gathered all the footage
from the small businesses and malls.

354
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,560
Name, Yoo Jo-yeol.

355
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,104
He regularly gave money
to the care center director.

356
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,190
We need to find out where he went
after leaving the care center.

357
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,332
I found him!

358
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,334
I think I found him.

359
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,462
Gyuyeong Villa, 31-4 Gwangi-dong.
From two months ago.

360
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,297
I found him too.

361
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,550
From three months ago, 31-4 Gwangi-dong.
Also at Gyuyeong Villa.

362
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,095
Looks like we found him.

363
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,431
I'll find Chief Park and get his approval.

364
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,851
We cannot reach anyone at the care center.

365
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,855
Get ready.

366
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,149
Hello? Ms. Song Jeong-hye?

367
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,155
Ms. Song Jeong-hye, are you inside?

368
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,496
Sin-jae, something smells weird.

369
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,333
It's gas. Get out! Now!

370
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:08,390
A fire broke out at an apartment building
awaiting redevelopment in Gwangi-dong.

371
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,559
It was caused by a gas explosion.

372
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,062
Six units in the building
were engulfed in flames,

373
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,940
but thankfully no one got hurt.

374
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,402
The police are investigating
what caused the gas explosion.

375
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,279
Fire officials were dispatched…

376
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,506
How have you been?

377
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,883
Who are you?

378
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,804
I was sent by the person
who can help you get your life back.

379
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,892
The life as the granddaughter
of Hogyeong Pharmaceuticals' founder.

380
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,563
You know me?

381
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,315
Who I...

382
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,526
Do you know who I used to be?

383
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,653
Do you know who I really am?

384
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,534
He'd like to know
what you could do for him

385
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:13,455
if he were to help you get your life back.

386
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,500
Anything. I'll do anything.

387
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,045
Seriously, I'll do anything he says.

388
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,380
Please...

389
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,841
Please help me go back.

390
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,051
Please, ma'am.

391
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,096
Hello?

392
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,515
Yes. It's me.

393
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:34,768
Mom, is everything okay?
Are you at Auntie's place?

394
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,981
Yes, Secretary Kim gave me a ride.

395
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,025
There are no reporters here,
so I'll be fine.

396
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,946
What about you? Are you all right?

397
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,241
Have you been eating well?

398
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,077
I'm just temporarily suspended,
that's all. Don't worry.

399
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:54,997
And Mom.

400
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,626
If I ask you what you had for dinner,

401
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,088
make sure you say you had mackerel, okay?

402
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,048
What are you talking about?

403
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,842
Mackerel? Why?

404
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,135
I'm not joking.

405
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,014
You have to say that, okay?
If not, there will be a problem.

406
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,475
What did you have for dinner?

407
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,145
I had mackerel.

408
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:19,855
Good?

409
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:20,772
Yes.

410
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,650
I'll call you again. Bye.

411
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,088
I could tell he recognized me.

412
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:53,180
Why is it that only the two of you
can open the gate with that thing

413
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,851
and even know more about the pain
I've never experienced before?

414
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,372
I can have it too, right?

415
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,417
The thing that you men
of the Royal Family have.

416
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,713
Manpasikjeok.

417
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,537
Not yet.

418
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,456
Not entirely.

419
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,916
I missed you so much.

420
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,379
I was going to just hear your voice
and leave.

421
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,301
I was going to call you
from that pay phone over there.

422
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,283
How far have you come?

423
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,245
Are you almost here?

424
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,507
Election day.

425
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,551
PEOPLE'S CHOICE

426
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,844
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

427
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,813
I'm thinking of opening
a milk tea place when I get the building.

428
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,189
That sounds great.

429
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,109
Give a discount to the kids
at the taekwondo center.

430
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,277
What's milk tea though?

431
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,369
Do you want to try it with me tomorrow?
Market research.

432
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,620
Sounds good.

433
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,413
What about me?

434
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,541
What about me? I have a lot of time.

435
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,459
Shouldn't you return to school?

436
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,754
Jeez, this is so loud.

437
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,467
My fourth goal was to return to school,
but that won't happen.

438
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,219
I have to look after my siblings.

439
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:26,810
By the way,
are you getting a call from this number?

440
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,061
Yes.

441
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,857
It looked like a spam call,
so I forwarded it to voice mail.

442
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,359
Isn't it the murder game?

443
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,445
Usually, the one who answers first dies
or is the culprit.

444
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,366
Then I'll die.

445
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:43,827
Hello?

446
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,078
Kang Sin-jae?

447
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,415
Who's this?

448
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,000
Someone who needs your help.

449
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:54,379
I'd appreciate it if you could pass it
to Lieutenant Jeong on your left.

450
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,181
He's asking for you.

451
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,227
Just eat, guys. I'll be right back.

452
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,576
You know me, don't you?

453
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,292
Aren't you that man
whom I met when I was little?

454
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,879
My mom's taekwondo belt...
That was you, wasn't it?

455
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,090
You remember that?

456
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,969
Who are you?

457
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,015
You're wearing the exact same clothes
as that day.

458
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,352
Also, your voice and face are the same.

459
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,981
You got me this outfit as a gift.
And this face is my gift for you.

460
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,109
What a crazy nutjob.

461
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,904
Sorry, my bad.

462
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:06,952
Sir, I'm sorry,
but I'm going to have to check your ID.

463
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,403
I should've given you a heads-up,
but I don't have ID.

464
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,447
And I've told you numerous times,
I'm not crazy.

465
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,285
How did you know
I was looking for a hair tie?

466
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,496
Because I like it when you do that.

467
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,629
I'm happy to see all five of you
in one place.

468
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,382
Those who'd help me
no matter what happens.

469
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,512
How did you know I was Jeong Tae-eul?

470
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,639
I heard you asked for me.

471
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,269
I was prepared for this,

472
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,983
but the moment when you don't recognize me
still makes me sad.

473
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,363
That's why I'm here.

474
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,408
To be part of your memories of today.

475
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:32,579
We're passing through different points
in time at the moment.

476
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,082
So until I get back,

477
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:41,296
please don't get tired of waiting
and hang in there.

478
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,761
We'll meet again in Gwanghwamun.

479
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,139
I'll be wearing a jacket
with a lot of buttons,

480
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,308
and I'll be there with Maximus.

481
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,185
Can you

482
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,689
try to be a little friendlier to me
when we meet again?

483
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:02,859
And make

484
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,362
some more time

485
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,947
for me.

486
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,575
We don't have much time.

487
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,037
Why will we meet again?

488
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,914
Because that's our destiny.

489
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,586
I can't come and see you
at every point in time

490
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:25,382
because the cracks
in the Manpasikjeok are deepening.

491
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,013
I should get going.

492
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:36,893
Whenever I'm with you,
I forget to keep count.

493
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,316
Bye.

494
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,232
He came

495
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,943
to see me again.

496
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,532
He came to see me again

497
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,243
in 2016.

498
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,041
Wait for me just a little bit more.

499
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,710
I'm almost there.

500
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,563
Ho-pil to the second floor.

501
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,150
Yeong.

502
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,613
Your Majesty.

503
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,541
Your Majesty.

504
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,836
Why on earth are you there?

505
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:52,880
Why are you here?

506
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,258
You should be at the start line.

507
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,302
-You didn't get changed.
-I'm sure I did.

508
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,305
Yeong, do you have the access card
to the racetracks?

509
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,472
Don't ask why.

510
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,448
Don't touch this. Just leave it here.

511
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,033
It is the king's order.

512
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,703
And you must remember
what I'm going to tell you now.

513
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,413
What's going on?

514
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,709
You'll eventually end up in a place
called the Republic of Korea.

515
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,462
You'll be left alone there,

516
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,715
and I need you to locate Song Jeong-hye.

517
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,470
I think that's what you wanted
to talk to me about

518
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,721
over a drink.

519
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,556
Who is Song Jeong-hye?

520
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,892
Even if I explain,
you won't understand now.

521
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,895
But you'll come to figure it out.

522
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,566
When that moment comes,
reach out to Detective Kang for help.

523
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,319
You won't trust
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul then.

524
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,822
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul?
Did you meet her?

525
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,951
I'm on my way

526
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,788
to meet her.

527
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,167
So you must not stop me now.

528
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,044
This is the king's order, too.

529
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:18,383
If I miss each moment by even a second,
I can't meet her.

530
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,680
Go wait at the finish line.
I'll win today.

531
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,319
Hey, out of the way!

532
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,819
Tae-eul, it's me.

533
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,739
You just went into a grocery store.

534
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,032
Instructor Jeong and Na-ri are inside.

535
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,536
I'll be right there.
Keep tailing her. Don't lose her.

536
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,704
You can do it, right?

537
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,374
Gosh, you can count on me.
I'm the Unbreakable Sword.

538
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:46,512
Hey, why didn't you bring your car
when you have so many?

539
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,848
Because they're all two-seaters.

540
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,184
Then Tae-eul and I can take your car.

541
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,811
Darn it. You got me with that one.

542
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,230
Then what if it's a one-seater?

543
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,690
Then I'll take the car.

544
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,192
But it's my car.

545
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,736
The two-seater too. They're all my cars.

546
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,573
Hey, there are two cars,
yet only three people can get in?

547
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,742
Why would you bring such cars?

548
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,296
Are you two always like this?

549
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:25,760
Does Jeong Tae-eul always listen

550
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,679
to these tear-jerkingly lame jokes?

551
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,849
What's with her?

552
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,855
I was wondering
why she kept telling me to buy beef.

553
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,234
It sounds like she's losing it a little.

554
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,265
Dad.

555
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,433
Na-ri.

556
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,315
Didn't I warn you?

557
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,735
That you'd die

558
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,112
if we crossed paths.

559
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,094
Let go.

560
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,014
Your dad said

561
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,351
he'll head out later to patrol the area,

562
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:44,857
but I saw some punks
who looked like hoodlums going that way.

563
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,861
Why?

564
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,449
You've never lost anyone in your life?

565
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,287
Then you should get used to it.

566
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,916
I've been

567
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,587
losing something every single day.

568
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,249
This is the Police Control Room.

569
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,961
This is Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

570
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,006
Please send backup.

571
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,719
I'm near Hyoja-ro 13-gil.

572
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:40,097
Send a patrol car at once.

573
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,042
Sir!

574
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:10,961
You, the man on the horse.

575
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:47,748
Finally,

576
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,461
we meet.

577
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,215
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

578
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,638
Hold him, Jeong Tae-eul.

579
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:06,934
Hold him in your arms.

580
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,942
You really came.

581
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,403
To Gwanghwamun.

582
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,992
And you're wearing a jacket
with a lot of buttons.

583
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,668
This is strange.

584
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,172
You seem to know me.

585
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,973
When it's fate, there are no coincidences.

586
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,143
It is inevitable by nature,

587
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,480
but when you realize its meaning,

588
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,984
it's always too late.

589
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,737
Let's skip that.

590
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,367
If I don't do this now,
I'll probably regret it later.

591
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,709
I am waiting for someone.

592
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,255
Is there no way for us to change fate?

593
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,966
I'm sorry that I keep making you wait.

594
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,842
Say that you'll be back.

595
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,886
-It's up to you.
-We...

596
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,847
just haven't reached our destination yet.

597
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,307
I won't let you. You can't.

598
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,935
Let's just not save the world.

599
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:14,103
Where's Manpasikjeok?

600
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,854
Where's Lieutenant Jeong right now?

601
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,523
Even if the door closes...

602
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,858
I promise I will return to you.
