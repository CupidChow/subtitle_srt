00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,235
JEONG TAE-EUL

2
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,112
I'm bored, let's play pool.

3
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,036
EPISODE 5

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,040
Thank you for your kindness.

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,334
I should repay you in cash,

6
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,212
but our worlds have different bills,
so I got you goods instead.

7
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,967
I hope you can get a satisfactory price.

8
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,849
Where did you get this?

9
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,393
Did you find oil in your yard
or something?

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
Oh, Sin-jae.

11
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,862
Can I get a sweet milk tea?

12
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,409
-I guess Squad Three is off duty tomorrow.
-Yes, I was thinking of playing pool.

13
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,162
I don't see the horse that was here.

14
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,498
Maximus? It's been gone for a while.

15
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,838
Everyone's been asking,
so I even wrote it on the sign out front.

16
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,846
But Tae-eul isn't here.

17
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,098
Who are you playing pool with?

18
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,643
-She's not here?
-Maybe she's back.

19
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,896
She left with that King guy a while ago.

20
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,193
THE HORSE ISN'T HERE

21
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,328
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

22
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,832
Head Court Lady Noh, it's me.

23
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,043
His Majesty just came back,
and he has a guest.

24
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,298
It's a woman.

25
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,135
Tell His Majesty to take a detour,

26
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,220
and use the sea route.

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,557
He shouldn't be seen by people.

28
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,436
Don't worry about the palace.
I'll make sure nobody talks.

29
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,613
FOUR TIGER SWORD

30
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,751
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

31
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,464
And my name, which you cannot say,

32
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,010
is Lee Gon.

33
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,019
So...

34
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,939
you do have a name.

35
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,111
If you really have a name,

36
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,324
I guess there's no way
to avoid a beheading now.

37
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,081
The way you've talked to me so far,
it's only right to behead you right away.

38
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,546
I'll escort you to the palace.

39
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,965
Let me take care of Maximus first.

40
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,425
The trip has been too long for her age.

41
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,719
Come to the racetracks.

42
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,018
Withdraw the guards from the racetracks
right now.

43
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,479
Two of you go to the control room
and get the security footage.

44
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,480
The rest, follow me.

45
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,633
What is this place?

46
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,095
Is it some kind of a fourth dimension?

47
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,556
I'm not sure yet.

48
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,476
I guess we can say it's something between
one and zero in my world and yours.

49
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,897
This is a place that cannot be
explained scientifically.

50
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,611
Do you see that balloon?

51
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,407
Balloons usually pop within ten hours.

52
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,785
But that one has been floating
like that for over ten days.

53
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,913
It hasn't popped or floated away.

54
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,624
It's exactly where I let it go.

55
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,129
That means there's no light,
wind, or air here.

56
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,048
Isn't that amazing?

57
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,342
If it's not science, what is it?

58
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,678
Is it some kind of magic?

59
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,765
It could be a part of a legend.

60
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,393
Time flows differently here as well.

61
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,438
One minute here is about an hour outside.

62
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,482
My watch stops here,

63
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,817
so I went back and forth
for several days to check.

64
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,030
How could you check when clocks stop here?

65
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,032
I used Euler's number.

66
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,037
I don't know how deep

67
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,540
or how vast this place is.

68
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
I'll reach the edge of this place someday.

69
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,754
And I'll tell you

70
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,923
all about it.

71
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,133
But for today, let's go to my world.

72
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,317
Lady Maximus has a lower blood pressure
than last time,

73
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,904
but it's still within a normal range.

74
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,823
"Lady"?

75
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,743
A horse is called a lady...

76
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,414
I will do another thorough checkup
in the morning, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,540
Please do.

78
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,011
I told you so. Everything I said to you
was true, wasn't it?

79
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,182
Don't you see that's driving me crazy?

80
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,227
If this is all real, it's terrifying.

81
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,188
And if it's not, that means I'm crazy.

82
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,481
Watch your manners.

83
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,858
And that face.

84
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,776
He is supposed to be on my side.

85
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,070
He's been on my side since I was three.

86
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,658
Is that gun real?

87
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,702
Can I take a look at it?

88
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,376
She knows how to handle it. Let her be.

89
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,837
She has to see for herself to believe it.

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,088
Believe what?

91
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,091
That she just crossed
between one and zero.

92
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,852
No way.

93
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,688
This is real?

94
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,815
This P30...

95
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,359
is actually real?

96
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,072
I'm going to check something.

97
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,575
It's nothing personal.

98
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,214
I told you. She can handle guns.

99
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,467
I'm letting this go just this once
because you're His Majesty's guest.

100
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,761
So...

101
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,387
this country...

102
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,389
and you being the King...

103
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,767
It's all real?

104
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,352
It's all real.

105
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,856
That gun, this world, and me.

106
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,610
So don't think of confirming that
by pulling the trigger.

107
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,447
This man is not going to move an inch.

108
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,408
Loosen your grip

109
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,619
unless you want to get killed.

110
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,262
Your Majesty, is she...

111
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,346
Yes.

112
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,807
She's Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

113
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,519
Do you...

114
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,271
know me as well?

115
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,296
Welcome to my palace.

116
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,395
This is Gwangyeongjeon.

117
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,188
It's my private residence.

118
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,482
Make yourself at home--

119
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,239
Did you really have to do this?

120
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,659
Are you trying to worry me to death?

121
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,620
Head Court Lady Noh...

122
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,664
I think it has only been
about 10 minutes and 50 seconds

123
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,750
since she believed I'm a king.

124
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,212
She's the important person who knows

125
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,340
where the buttons came from.

126
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,637
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

127
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,766
Put all your belongings here in the box.

128
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,105
Everyone has to go through
a security check when entering the palace.

129
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,817
Everyone, including the court ladies,
and even the Prime Minister.

130
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,991
You reap what you sow.

131
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,132
You're giving them back
to me later, right?

132
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,968
I'll be penalized
if I lose my ID card again.

133
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,932
You recognize her face, right?

134
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,434
You're right.

135
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,482
Do I have to get frisked now?

136
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,067
We'll skip that.

137
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,944
I should trust you.

138
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,363
You're my King's guest.

139
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,160
Let me talk to you for a moment.

140
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,620
Now?

141
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,001
I'm sure you want to talk later.

142
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,005
But I also would have liked it
if you had left the palace later

143
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:00,428
and brought a guest according
to the correct procedures later.

144
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:05,182
There were five guards and one person
at the stable who saw her.

145
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,728
Twelve court ladies who would be
suspicious of being

146
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,563
-dismissed suddenly--
-I was on my way.

147
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,358
I needed to talk now anyway.

148
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,531
You should leave, too.

149
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,658
It's a King's order.

150
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,419
Don't worry.

151
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,795
Just wait here.

152
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,549
I'll ditch her somehow and come back.

153
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,093
My goodness...

154
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,180
You're really asking for it, aren't you?

155
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,101
I mean...

156
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,937
Your Highness.

157
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,028
I guess that was the wrong thing to say.

158
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,449
She really believes it now.

159
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,744
That I am the King.

160
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,465
My goodness, my head.

161
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,258
Oh, my heart.

162
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,552
My goodness.

163
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,634
You have a staff meeting at 8:00 a.m.
regarding the 25th anniversary

164
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,427
of your coronation.

165
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,431
And you have an appointment for tea
with press company CEOs at 10:00 a.m.

166
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,642
And at 1:00 p.m.
you'll be making the first throw

167
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,060
at the basketball season-opening.

168
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,061
Hang on.

169
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,647
I left the palace for just half a day,

170
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,607
and I have that many things to do?

171
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,152
Maybe someone in the court
holds a grudge against you.

172
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,532
-Is there more?
-Yes.

173
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,909
You have a speech to deliver at 2:00 p.m.

174
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,452
at the International Congress
of Mathematicians.

175
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,873
Then there is a flood relief supply
delivery ceremony at 4:00 p.m.

176
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,875
You can go there by helicopter.

177
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,042
All right.

178
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,711
I'll do all that,

179
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,588
so please let me eat dinner in peace.

180
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,550
It's always suspicious
when you do something on your own.

181
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,260
You're crossing the line now.

182
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,846
I'll be eating by myself in the study.

183
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,973
Alone.

184
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,395
There is a guest in His Majesty's study.

185
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,273
You must keep that guest

186
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,443
locked up in there
until I give other orders.

187
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,879
Ironically, my first duty as King

188
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,089
was to carry out
the funeral of the former King.

189
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,841
It was when I was eight.

190
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,690
I'm positive now

191
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,360
that it's a parallel universe.

192
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,946
Pardon?

193
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,490
Na-ri.

194
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,951
Myeong Na-ri.

195
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,911
Who's Myeong Na-ri?

196
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,165
I'm Myeong Seung-a
from the Royal Public Affairs Office.

197
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,636
I know it won't be true,

198
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,930
but I just want to make sure.

199
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,265
Don't you own a building?

200
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,268
Didn't you rent it out
to a Taekwondo center?

201
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,525
I do own buildings,
but they're all in Canada.

202
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,653
Would you like some tea?

203
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,530
It's herbal tea. It'll help you sleep.

204
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,203
You want me to fall asleep?

205
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,788
I'd be grateful if you could.

206
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,915
I came here to keep an eye on you,

207
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,502
and you won't be able to leave
until Head Court Lady Noh says otherwise.

208
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,713
It will be easy for both of us
if you sleep.

209
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,633
You're really straightforward,

210
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,469
just like Na-ri.

211
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,597
I...

212
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,560
Can I use that laptop over there?

213
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,602
Of course not.

214
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,188
You can't use His Majesty's laptop
without his permission.

215
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,902
-It's the year 2019 here, right?
-Yes.

216
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,780
And was this room's owner born in 1987?

217
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,365
Of course.

218
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,993
And the cultural capital is Busan,

219
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,495
and there are 63 buildings
called 63 Building.

220
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,290
-There's only one 63 Building in Seoul.
-That little jerk.

221
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,834
Did you just swear at me?

222
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,883
What would be the better answer?

223
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,140
Can I have alcohol instead of tea?

224
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,976
I'd love some soju.

225
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,274
Your Majesty, where did you go this time?

226
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,777
A parallel universe.

227
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,138
Why do you need a laptop?

228
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,434
I wanted to look some stuff up
on the internet.

229
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,316
This is a work phone,
so I can't lend it to you.

230
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,402
But if you tell me,
I'll read out the search results for you.

231
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,905
I guess that will work.

232
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,700
All right. Then...

233
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,577
Lee Gon.

234
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,499
What did you just say?

235
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,875
Lee Gon.

236
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,087
Isn't the King's name Lee Gon?

237
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,713
Have you lost your mind?

238
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,008
Are you just casually speaking
the King's name out loud like that?

239
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,471
You don't even know the 63 Building,
and you don't know the King's age.

240
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,143
Who in the world are you?

241
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,895
Oh, did you live abroad for a long time?

242
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,897
But even so,

243
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,233
how could you be so indifferent
toward your home country?

244
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,152
Well...

245
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,155
This isn't my home country.

246
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:22,161
Well, my earth is still flat for me,
so I can't explain.

247
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,706
Let's just say I'm an illegal immigrant.

248
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,876
Oh, my gosh.

249
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,802
Can you leave us? It won't take long.

250
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,228
She's an illegal immigrant.

251
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,360
Why are you smiling?

252
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,322
I know someone who looks like you,
but you're so different from him.

253
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,656
I'm sorry about earlier.

254
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,243
But were you always like this?

255
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,496
So prudent and serious?

256
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,498
Hold this.

257
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,169
I understand how you feel.
I went through that too.

258
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,938
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

259
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,898
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

260
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,109
You can ask your boss why.

261
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,820
He's a science guy,
so he'd be better at explaining.

262
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,867
Are you...

263
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,371
from a parallel universe?

264
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,414
Where the capital is Seoul,

265
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,584
and the country's name
is the Republic of Korea?

266
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,712
How do you know that?

267
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,468
Who are you?

268
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,638
What have you done to His Majesty?

269
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,267
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

270
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,061
He has a scar on his shoulder?

271
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,983
I don't know anything about that.

272
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,444
We're not close enough to show
each other's backs.

273
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,614
And don't talk to me like that.

274
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,200
You were born in 1991, right?
I'm a year older than you.

275
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,998
Captain Jo.

276
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,061
I said I wanted the halls empty.

277
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,068
-Your Majesty, I wanted to ask a few--
-I know.

278
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,029
I know you're curious,

279
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,364
and I understand why you want
to check her fingerprints.

280
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,074
I'll send you a link.

281
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,993
It's about quantum mechanics.

282
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,746
Send me your questions by text
after reading it.

283
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,666
And will you open the door now?
The food is getting cold.

284
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,377
But Your Majesty.

285
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,172
Didn't you get any alcohol?

286
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,468
Your guest was asking for some.

287
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,305
Yeong.

288
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,348
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,477
Will you find out where the alcohol fridge
is located in the palace?

290
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,479
Pardon?

291
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,318
By the way,

292
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,071
when do you think His Majesty saw me?

293
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,656
I greeted him,

294
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,452
but he said we'd met before
and that he was glad to see me.

295
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,830
I had never met him before.

296
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,669
Was there anything notable
about the woman in there?

297
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,422
-Apart from her asking for alcohol.
-You shouldn't ask me.

298
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,633
I'm only going to report
to Head Court Lady Noh.

299
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,762
You're good at your job.

300
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,724
I feel so sad about
missing this great opportunity.

301
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,269
I have to go meet Head Court Lady Noh.

302
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,146
I'll be off, then.

303
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,452
-Did you just lock me up in here?
-I'm housing you.

304
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,079
So be understanding.

305
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,998
I brought you here
without saying anything.

306
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,669
Everyone's in a panic
because this has never happened before.

307
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,170
Why are you so calm, then?

308
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,049
I imagined bringing you here
lots of times before.

309
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,551
But not like this.

310
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,348
Did you sign a contract or something?
Did you buy land?

311
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,563
I stopped myself from wiping it
on the wall because of your citizens.

312
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,149
You should promote that employee
who was watching me.

313
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,275
She's a real patriot.

314
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,778
Let me borrow your phone,
and give it to me unlocked.

315
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,947
She wouldn't lend me her phone.

316
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,450
What are you going to look up?

317
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,452
I'm sure you have nowhere to call.

318
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,163
None of your business.

319
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,372
What's your passcode?

320
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,541
Who would even try to look
through a King's phone?

321
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,459
It's not locked.

322
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,091
Pass me the snack.

323
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,593
It's not a snack, it's dinner.

324
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,888
I thought you might be hungry.

325
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,516
You try it first.

326
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,812
-What?
-I'm not joking.

327
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,106
I'm Alice in Wonderland right now.

328
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,568
She eats weird pills
and grows bigger and smaller and stuff.

329
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,571
What if I eat this and die from poisoning
or natural causes?

330
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,990
Don't worry.

331
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,743
I keep my promises.
You'll die from a beheading.

332
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,662
All right, then.

333
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,080
I'll enjoy the food.

334
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,758
You made this yourself?

335
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,511
Yes. Is it good?

336
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,930
No, it's bad.

337
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,102
I haven't done this for about 25 years,

338
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,146
but I should call my officials today.

339
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,441
In this world, if I say,
"Anyone out there?"

340
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,818
everyone will come rushing...

341
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,155
Oh, gosh.

342
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,912
Were you standing outside the door?

343
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,623
Do you think I have
that much time on my hands?

344
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,709
And you were here this whole time?

345
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,461
No, I came just a minute ago.

346
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,880
I barely sat down.

347
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,969
I prepared a bedroom and a meal
for your guest,

348
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,723
but since she seems to have eaten,
I will escort her to her room.

349
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,894
It is the farthest room from your room,
Your Majesty.

350
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,699
I'll see you tomorrow. Get some sleep.

351
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,290
I was talking to you.

352
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,251
You should really sleep well.

353
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,049
Is it far to the right
or to the left from my room?

354
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,635
My goodness!

355
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,732
Besides emergency situations,

356
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,818
outsiders hardly ever stay

357
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,987
in the palace overnight.

358
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:59,909
So you must never speak
about what happened today

359
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,620
anywhere or to anyone.

360
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:07,292
You must keep everything a secret,
such as the layout of the palace,

361
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,129
or the private conversations
you've had with the King.

362
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,173
You don't need to worry about that.

363
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,467
I'm a government official, too.

364
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,968
So I've seen.

365
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,764
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

366
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,687
I've been meaning to ask this.

367
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,898
How do you people...

368
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,233
know me?

369
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,196
A lieutenant in the police force?

370
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,200
It is very strange.

371
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:47,082
His Majesty has had a strange ID card
since he was young.

372
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:53,129
There was no police officer named
Jeong Tae-eul in the Kingdom of Corea,

373
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,176
and there is no such rank
as lieutenant in the police force here.

374
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:04,766
I thought that it was a fake ID
made as a joke or for some other reason,

375
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,894
but that nonexistent person

376
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,771
suddenly appeared here.

377
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,149
It's shocking.

378
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,737
Everything is just absurd,

379
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,615
but there is one thing I'm sure about.

380
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,328
An existence that cannot be explained
will only bring chaos to the world,

381
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,789
and it will only harm our King.

382
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,833
So...

383
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,210
during your stay here,

384
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,631
please try to avoid contact

385
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:42,011
with anyone besides the King,
the Chief of the Royal Guard, and me.

386
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,766
Furthermore,
don't get curious about this world,

387
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,185
and don't try to stay.

388
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,023
And when I say "this world,"

389
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,776
that includes the King.

390
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,553
I was right.

391
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,847
It was far to the right.

392
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,021
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

393
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,815
You came empty-handed?

394
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,327
There's a bed and a sofa in here.
Why are you sitting on the floor?

395
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,789
There's a draft in here,
especially on the left side of the bed.

396
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,804
Why are you here?

397
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,183
I didn't want to leave you scared
all by yourself.

398
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,395
Trust me. I'm not a weird person here.

399
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:01,025
Why did you use the window
instead of the door if you're not weird?

400
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,195
You should know...

401
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,030
That's the shortcut.

402
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,491
The palace is really big.

403
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,578
I thought you couldn't sit on the floor.

404
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,289
It's not so bad, actually.

405
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,959
And it feels kind of nice with the draft.

406
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,053
When are you going to show me my ID card?

407
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,601
-Tomorrow.
-Why tomorrow?

408
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,229
-Were you just pretending to have it?
-I do have it.

409
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,316
You might try to go back to your world

410
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,193
if I show you.

411
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,577
What is it?

412
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,996
What?

413
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,506
The doll on my car key.

414
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,800
It seems pretty cheap.

415
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:19,729
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

416
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,773
You can win this
if you hit the target seven times.

417
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,233
But if you've served in the military,

418
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,235
it'll be a piece of cake.

419
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,197
It's 10,000 won for 10 bullets.
How many do you want?

420
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,573
I only need seven bullets.

421
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,803
You should really know,

422
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,098
nothing I have is cheap.

423
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,853
How much did you spend?

424
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,773
Anyone who's served in the military
can do it with their eyes closed.

425
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,774
I knew it.

426
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,027
Everyone in your country is a swindler.

427
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,156
Be quiet. There's someone
guarding the door outside.

428
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,618
Are you stupid?
There are dozens of security cameras here.

429
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,333
Is that a security camera?

430
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,210
Wave to them.

431
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,088
Twelve people are watching us right now.

432
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,173
For real?

433
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,138
You believe everything I say now.

434
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,056
That was a lie.

435
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,477
Are you kidding me?

436
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,814
So...

437
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,442
is that really a security camera or not?

438
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,944
It isn't. I was just joking.

439
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,490
You want proof?

440
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,292
Move.

441
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,754
This might look romantic,

442
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,631
but it's actually really uncomfortable.

443
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,593
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

444
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,561
I'm going to ask you something,
so just answer with yes or no.

445
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,605
Okay.

446
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,232
You've never dated before, right?

447
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,444
You startled me.

448
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,238
Yes,

449
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,656
I have.

450
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,784
Should I guess when?

451
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,203
-Guess.
-Now.

452
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,753
Should I have done this?

453
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,737
Try guessing what I just proved.

454
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,198
The fact that I've dated before?

455
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,658
Or...

456
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,577
that I'm dating right now?

457
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,855
Did Squad Two find the weapon used
in their murder case?

458
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,566
Chief Choe is begging me to help him out.

459
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,361
I just handed the information over.
It's a common kitchen knife.

460
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,113
Right.

461
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,323
It'd be about this size.

462
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,283
I see.

463
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,956
Here, here, and here.

464
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,085
And made sure the victim would die.

465
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,881
Why is the world so dark?

466
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,799
Let's live a bright life.

467
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,426
As bright as a light bulb.

468
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:23,931
I can't possibly be bright when
my husband is leaving home at this hour.

469
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,435
Come on, I don't want to leave.

470
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,229
But I can't help it.
Sin-jae asked for just one glass...

471
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,149
Don't make me work
after work hours have passed.

472
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,195
I can check your call records
within ten minutes.

473
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,616
Honey, wait. I'll push that.

474
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,533
No, I'll do it.

475
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,245
Honey, then could I put that in the car
and take a taxi in front of the building?

476
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,788
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

477
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,641
CHIEF PARK

478
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,895
I'm having a drink with you today.

479
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,775
Who are you actually meeting, then?

480
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,446
Loneliness.

481
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,790
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

482
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,138
I told you to sleep well,
but I guess you didn't.

483
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,558
It's a Royal Guard uniform.

484
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,145
You want me to run away in disguise?

485
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,731
I won't let you do that.

486
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,651
I have a full schedule today.

487
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,613
Get dressed and come out.
We have to leave without Noh noticing.

488
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,035
If that was your plan,
you should've been more meticulous.

489
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,756
Oh, my goodness gracious.

490
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,051
I made sure to separate you,
but you came here this early.

491
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,555
Right, I guess it's better for you
to go outside.

492
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,599
Come back as late as you can.

493
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,894
And don't get any photos taken.
No photos together!

494
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,189
My goodness.

495
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,197
This was my plan all along.

496
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,158
I've succeeded.

497
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,829
You said you weren't a weird person here.

498
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,303
IT'S MY VERY FIRST TIME
SEEING HIS MAJESTY IN PERSON!

499
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:28,115
His Majesty will make the first throw
for our victory today.

500
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,076
Please give a round of applause.

501
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,215
Please give a round of applause

502
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:48,135
and a loud cheer for the King
who did the first throw for us.

503
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,143
The architect Richard Fuller said,

504
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,896
"When I find a solution to a problem,

505
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,901
I know that I am wrong if the solution
is not beautiful."

506
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,071
So I'm giving you this advice

507
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:12,159
as an amateur mathematician
and also as your King.

508
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,538
WALK

509
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,623
Leave your lab
for at least 30 minutes a day.

510
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,960
Your labs

511
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,212
need to be cleaned.

512
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,429
Get plenty of rest.

513
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:35,015
Your bodies are not infinite decimals.

514
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,810
ATMOSPHERE

515
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,565
Share beautiful moments
with your family and loved ones.

516
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,068
Even mathematicians can do it.

517
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,249
You are all proud mathematicians
of the Kingdom of Corea.

518
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,668
Whatever problem you are working on,

519
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,213
I hope your solution and your answer

520
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,091
are both beautiful.

521
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,527
Wasn't I cool?

522
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,364
Yes, you were.

523
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,242
I think so, too.

524
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,077
I've thought that for a long time.

525
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,091
Captain Jo.

526
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,968
Please do as I requested.

527
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,100
Can you look this way, please?

528
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,860
It doesn't seem to be a present.

529
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,822
"I got you out of the palace since
you might stay locked up in the study.

530
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,741
Have fun. I'll see you in the evening."

That is what His Majesty said.

His Majesty has other duties to attend to,
so you're on your own now.

533
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,007
"Oh, thanks.

534
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,260
It's totally my style."

535
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,221
Tell him I said that.

536
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:40,808
But...

537
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,435
Do you have some money?

538
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,940
I bought your boss
chicken and stuff in the other world.

539
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,746
It's about 50 minutes
to the disaster area.

540
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,541

552
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,865
Did you photoshop me?

553
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,034
You're crazy.

00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,829
This must be some new scam,

564
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,830
I've never chosen the wrong person.

565
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,668
The woman in these photos is you.

566
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,129
To be exact,

567
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,715
it's you in another world.

568
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,843
In this world,

569
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,390
you're living in hell.

570
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,286
How did you get these photos?

571
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,539
Did you come into my house?

572
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,583
You have a useless lock,

573
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,003
a window with no sunlight coming through,

574
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,964
and walls that can't protect you
from the cold nor the heat.

575
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,091
Is that house any different

576
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,801
from a grave?

577
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,971
How about giving your daughter

578
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,016
a house, a car,

579
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,685
and parents like this?

580
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,149
Instead of used garbage like that.

581
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,946
How do you know it's a girl?

582
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,618
You...

583
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,205
Whether you're a swindler or a member
of a cult, you've got the wrong person.

584
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,539
I'm sending you to jail.

585
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,543

586
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,508
Hello? You may speak.

587
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,433
Who are you?

588
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,228
Someone who's going to save your life.

589
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,271
How are you going to do that?

590
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,192
What do I have to do...

591
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,531
to get that?

592
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,076
You just have to kill the other you.

593
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,038
All right, then...

594
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,669
Would you like to change

595
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,213
your miserable life?

596
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,967
What are you going to do

597
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,552
if I say no?

598
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,804
I already saw your face.

599
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,723
Am I going to die

600
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,600
instead of...

601
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,143
her?

602
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,813
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

603
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,318
Nobody has refused until now.

604
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,201
It's okay

605
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,454
for you to be the first exception.

606
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,708
It'll be interesting to me.

607
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,503
Wait.

608
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,047
Wait...

609
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,427
How...

610
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,224
should I contact you?

611
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,859
I'll be the one

612
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,028
to contact you.

613
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,241
It's an urgent report from
the Ministry of National Defense.

614
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,035
A Chinese fishing boat
sent a distress signal

615
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,120
in the intermediate zone of the East Sea.

616
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,206
The Yi Sun-sin Destroyer
that was nearby received the signal.

617
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,752
-Are they sure it's a fishing boat?
-Yes, they confirmed it.

618
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:45,005
They say it must've been stranded
because of the severe fog and swells.

619
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,882
This happened last spring as well.

620
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,052
The Japanese Navy
could interfere again, right?

621
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,096
Yes, after Japan broke off
the EEZ agreement,

622
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,432
both Japan and China
are sensitive about such things.

623
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,142
Let's just think simply.

624
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,603
We'll be more aggressive
at the next negotiation with Japan,

625
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,647
and rescue those people
since we got the signal.

626
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,651
And tell our people to ask them
why they keep fishing in our waters.

627
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,445
Yes, ma'am.

I hope you become a Prime Minister
who values the citizens.

633
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,853
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

634
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,733
What kind of Prime Minister
should I be to you?

635
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,781
Please be a Prime Minister
who mostly gives written reports.

636
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,750
Prime Minister Koo.

637
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,752
I can never be indebted to you.

638

647
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,466
I mean, the Kingdom of Corea's
GDP is that high?

648
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,302
We export rare-earth elements
internationally.

649
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,763
It's even in school textbooks.

650
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:43,141
I'm sorry, but what are
rare-earth elements?

651
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,393
It's always mentioned in exams.

652
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,562
Cerium, lanthanum, yttrium, samarium...

653
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,483
Are you a foreigner?

654
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,029
Yeah, something like that.

655
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,282
So, what are they?

656
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,159
Well, they're minerals.

657
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:05,330
There are 30 million tons
just in the northern area, and in the sea.

658
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:09,084
Anyway, those minerals in the north
are worth $20 billion a ton,

659
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,836
so it'd be about six quintillion dollars.

660
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,340
And that's all owned
by the Kingdom of Corea?

661
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,675
Oh, no.

662
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,345
The mountains where they're buried
are owned by the Royal Court,

663
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,556
so they're actually the King's.

664
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,188
It's a diamond?

665
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,692
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

666
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,610
A king?

667
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,072

Sir. Over there.

679
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,508
Hey, look who it is. Isn't that Luna?

680
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,719
She even changed her hairstyle.

681
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,387
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

682
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,639
-Get her.
-Yes, sir.

683
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,186
Who are you to block my way?
Do you have a death wish?

684
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,646
You're...

685
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,855
Yes, I'm Jo Yeong.

686
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,233
You got out quickly.

687
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,861
-What did you say that woman's name was?
-Luna.

688
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,113
You know, the one
we were chasing last time.

689
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,198
Are you sure?

690
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,699
She took off with our boss' money

691
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,577
and even got a new hairstyle with it.
How could we forget her?

692
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,829
Our boss is still in jail because of her.

693
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,666
-But that bitch is wandering around--
-All right. Get lost.

694
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,959
She's my guest for now.

695
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,961
Don't make me repeat myself.

696
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,827

00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,161

00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,103
Right, don't end up like me.

707
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,188
My husband cheated on me

708
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,149
when I was seven months pregnant.

709
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,486
Excuse me.

710
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,363
I guess Seo-ryeong is coming.

711
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,283
I've just lost my appetite.
Did she have to come?

712
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:29,909
I'm leaving first.

713
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,536
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

714
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:40,920
Did she just leave?

715
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,672
She said she lost her appetite.

716
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,842
The food isn't even served yet.
That's nonsense.

717
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,218
Didn't you know?

718
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,387
Congressman Park Cheol-ung,
the one involved in the sex scandal.

719
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,098
-He's her sister-in-law's brother-in-law.
-So what?

720
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,808
I barely remember my sister-in-law's face.

721
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,853
Bad things keep happening
to people who oppose you.

722
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,608
Rumors say the only one
who benefits from the scandal is you.

723
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,860
The person who benefits the most

724
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,278
is usually the culprit.

725
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,740
It's just that the people who oppose me
happen to have dark secrets.

726
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,786
My husband says Prince Buyeong
has your back.

727
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,080
-Is that true?
-What if it is?

728
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,165
Does he want to take sides with me?

729
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,750
Can he?

730
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,711
Are the Royal Family your in-laws now?

731
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,838
Is that why you're serving another term?

732
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,256
You really think she can?

733
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:29,094
That "I studied while selling fish" line
doesn't work anymore.

734
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,430
A queen with no term limit is better

735
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,766
than a Prime Minister
with a five-year term.

736
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,769
But I'm not sure
if His Majesty likes old women.

737
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,565
Do you want to see
if it still works or not?

738
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,152
What will you do if the priority
for the remainder of my term

739
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,364
is to do a tax investigation into
your husband's company, Sungwoon Group?

740
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,992
What'll you do
if I obsess over that like a lunatic?

741
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,455
Aren't you going to leave?

742
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,335
I don't think our conversation
will be good for your baby.

743
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,257
Auntie's sorry about that.

744
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,744
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

745
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,761
Excuse me.

746
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,434
Don't you know me?

747
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,352
It's Jeong Tae-eul.

748
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,937
Don't you know?

749
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,022
Well...

750
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,565
Do you know her?

751
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,362
No, I don't. Who are you?

752
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,948
Then what about Kang Sin-jae? Or Jangmi?

753
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,618
Or what about Director Kim Hee-ju
from Forensics?

754
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,453
I'm not sure who they are.

755
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,164
The names sound like
they are kind-hearted people...

756
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,707
What is this about?

757
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,709
Are you visiting the station?

758
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,837
Are you a detective?

759
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,510
No, it's nothing. I guess I was mistaken.

760
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,429
Enjoy your meal.

761
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,598
-All right.
-Oh, okay.

762
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,480
You've been on the news
too often these days.

763
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,650
Yeah, I was so shocked.
I look so good on screen.

764
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,609
You looked so cool.

765
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,402
What do you want to eat?
I want ox bone soup.

766
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,779
I want ox knee soup.

767
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,951
Hey, but how did she know
we were on our way to eat?

768
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,209
Bye.

769
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,633
-Let's eat ox knee soup.
-All right, I know a place.

770
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,051
It's been there for 50 years,

771
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,428
and the bone soup tastes
just like knee soup.

772
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,721
Don't be ridiculous.

773
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,659
If he hasn't become a detective...

774
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,036
Right...

775
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,455
It means his family didn't go bankrupt.

776
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,251
The Kang Sin-jae of the Kingdom of Corea

777
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,086
is so cool.

778
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,841
Wow.

779
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,252
Oh, hey.

780
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,922
I'm running into you often lately.

781
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,007
And you're still eating sweets.

782
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,719
I don't eat sweets that often,
but I keep getting caught eating them.

783
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,390
-What are you doing in this neighborhood?
-I live around here.

784
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,644
Well, I used to live around here.

785
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,356
I guess you're having a gathering today.

786
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,567
I'm just going to have some drinks.

787
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,903
This won't be enough
if I start drinking in the daytime.

788
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,279
Do you want one?

789
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,709
Is it okay for a psychiatrist
to be an alcoholic?

790
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,295
I'm not that dependent.
I have a high alcohol tolerance.

791
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,590
But are sweets really effective?

792
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,137
It's just nice
because it's sweet and melts fast.

793
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,681
Isn't it better for it to melt
slowly if it's sweet?

794
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,474
It's going to melt anyway.

795
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,187
By the way, what's your job?

796
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,692
I thought I'd ask you at the next session,
but you didn't come.

797
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,779
-I'm a detective.
-Really?

798
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,365
I guessed totally wrong.

799
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,077
-I thought you were a gangster.
-What kind of psychiatrist...

800
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,164
That's why the meds didn't work.

801
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,082
You probably didn't even take them.

802
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,503
When did you move away
from this neighborhood?

803
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,423
I've always lived here,
so we could've run into each other...

804
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:48,181
Yes. I told you that my family
went bankrupt when I was little.

805
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,726
We moved out when I was in middle school.

806
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,897
The house prices here
went up a lot, right?

807
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,108
I visit here sometimes,
but I feel so bitter.

808
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,863
What do you think makes you
keep returning to this place?

809
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,159
Do you still have
the same recurring nightmares?

810
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,664
Don't start a session
so suddenly like this.

811
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,917
Especially when you're drinking.

812
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,960
You're treating me like some quack.

813
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,381
All right. Let's just drink, then.

814
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,817
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

815
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,237
Jeong who?

816
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,696
SUIM ORIENTAL CLINIC

817
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,365
Jeong Do-in.

818
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:51,160
He's a Taekwondo instructor
at a Taekwondo center.

819
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,246
I don't know anyone by that name.

820
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,458
Then...

821
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:05,007
How about a woman named Ahn Bong-hui?

822
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,093
Do you know her?

823
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,178
Her face looks really similar to mine.

824
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,722
Have you ever seen her?

825
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,808
Ahn Bong-hui?

826
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,810
No, I haven't.

827
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,354
We've lived here for 30 years.

828
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,107
Why? Did they say they live here?

829
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,193
No, never mind. Thank you.

830
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,499
It's 41,800 won.

831
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,001
Oh, right. One second.

832
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:52,179
I'm sorry, but how much
is a standing ticket?

833
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,682
It's 34,800 won.

834
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,148
I rode a taxi
without thinking about the ticket.

835
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,736
I'm sorry,
but is there a bus terminal in Gangnam?

836
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,487
There's one in Songpa-gu.

837
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:12,033
But even if you go now,
you'd miss the last bus.

838
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:13,910
Don't you have a card?

839
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,543
I'm telling you, it's not a prank call!

840
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,045
I really know Lee Gon...

841
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,883
I mean, the King... I know the King.

842
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,427
Okay? I'm an acquaintance.

843
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,637
I...

844
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,893
I'm really serious.

845
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,063
I just need to talk to him for one minute.

846
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:49,153
I'm short of 2,600 won,

847
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,615
so I can't return to Busan right now.

848
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:58,913
Just ten seconds.

849
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,540
Please, just ten seconds. I...

850
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:09,966
Who

851
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,260
did you say it was just now?

852
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,513
Well, Your Majesty,

853
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:20,726
some woman called the Royal Court's
main number 17 times asking for you.

854
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,521
-The security team was checking--
-No,

855
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,399
I mean the name of the caller.

856
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,986
Well, she said she was Princess Diana.

857
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:33,030
They tracked her location just in case,
and she's at Seoul Station.

858
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,492
Turn the helicopter.

859
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,536
We're going to Seoul.

860
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:40,538
Pardon?

861
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:43,416
Check Captain Jo's location right now.

862
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,417
Yes, Your Majesty.

863
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,648
Oh, my gosh!

864
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,360
What are you doing here?

865
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,987
I received orders from the King.

866
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,323
He said you must be kept alive
until your beheading.

867
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,705
But do you even really behead people here?

868
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,292
It hasn't happened since 1920, but...

869
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,046
it seems like it could happen again soon.

870
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,380
My gosh.

871
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:34,925
Who are you, really?

872
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,761
Are you really a detective?

873
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,638
Why did you go
to the police station earlier?

874
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,100
Were you following me?

875
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:45,686
Follow me.

876
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:37,905
I heard you were looking for me.

877
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,032
Yes.

878
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,200
Seventeen times.

879
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,035
Yes.

880
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,954
I thought you were going to stay in Busan.

881
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:46,956
Why did you come so far?

882
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,584
Did you get to find Ahn Bong-hui?

883
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,877
How did you know?

884
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,174
How long were you following me?

885
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,718
You should have lent me money
if you were there all along.

886
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,054
Who is she?

887
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,307
Who are you looking for in this world?

888
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,021
My mom.

889
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,692
If this is a parallel world...

890
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,404
and since Na-ri and Eun-sup are both here,

891
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,116
although I might not exist...

892
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,953
my mother could still be alive.

893
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,456
I know she is someone else,

894
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,085
but I didn't want her to be sick
in this world.

895
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:37,006
I only have memories of her
from when I was five.

896
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,218
So I just wanted to watch her from afar.

897
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,220
That's why I came here.

898
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,849
You should have told me.

899
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:48,976
I was just curious.

900
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,145
But she wasn't there.

901
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:53,647
Anyway...

902
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,984
I had fun today because of you.

903
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:58,986
Is that why you searched for KTX?

904
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,071
I was wondering what KTX is.

905
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,115
Search?

906
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,494
He didn't tell me that.

907
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,830
The auto-save function told me.

908
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,875
You were curious about a lot of things.

909
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,920
Why were you curious about
Lee Gon's ex-girlfriend?

910
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,339
Didn't you think
that I never had a girlfriend?

911
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,343
Why would you read that?

912
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:23,928
That's cheating.

913
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,765
Your Majesty, Prime Minister Koo is--

914
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,392
Right. You looked up
Prime Minister Koo as well.

915
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,019
That was because...

916
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:36,523
Because I heard she was
the youngest female Prime Minister.

917
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:39,068
I only looked up her name
because I was amazed by that.

918
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,987
Why? Do you feel guilty?

919
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,572
I meet her every Friday.

920
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,075
Is she IU?

921
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,042
Yes, it's Prime Minister Koo.

922
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:59,088
She probably got a report
that your helicopter landed in Seoul.

923
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,870
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,

924
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,665
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

925
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:36,500
You're right.

926
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,877
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

927
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:41,880
Nice to meet you.

928
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,342
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong,
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Corea.

929
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,652
