EPISODE 4

2
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,632
Here's the iced tea latte.

3
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,636
Hot.

4
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,973
What the...
Why is the iced drink so hot?

5
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,101
You are a piece of work.
Are you still drunk?

6
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,727
It was really hot just now.

7
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
My gosh.

8
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,191
Are you okay?

9
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,862
I don't understand why guys
from the southern region like this stuff.

10
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,906
How are you supposed to drink
something so hot?

11
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,950
Next time, I'll make it for you.

12
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,871
I should at least know
how to make my own cup of coffee.

13
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,289
It's okay. I'll do it.

14
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,374
Sir?

15
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,961
Prime Minister has arrived at the helipad.

16
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,045
Today's Friday?

17
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,715
I can't believe this.

18
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,051
-Sir?
-What?

19
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,143
I'm listening.

20
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,856
We found an intruder at Point 06,
and it turns out it was His Majesty.

21
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,450
I've

22
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,911
finally met you,

23
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,413
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

24
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,291
Where are you going?

25
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,251
Back to my world.

26
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,963
I'm the king of my country.
I left the palace empty for too long.

27
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,884
It's not that I didn't know
how to go back.

28
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,178
I just didn't want to go.

29
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,722
So, this is a parallel world?

30
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,182
Prove it.

31
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,684
The proof is right in front of you.

32
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,648
I came from the other world.

33
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,703
LEE SANG-DO MURDER CASE

34
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,539
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

35
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,626
FOUND LEE SANG-DO'S BODY
WEAPON, CROWBAR

36
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,340
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

37
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,841
CASE SUMMARY

38
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,970
Why did you become a detective?

39
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,139
I was born into my profession.

40
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,641
The king.

41
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,603
I am curious as to how others grow
to have aspirations.

42
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,274
You know that sounds cocky, right?

43
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,109
It may be,

44
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,529
but I go through things
that others don't go through.

45
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,783
When I was little,

46
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,329
I watched The Police with my dad

47
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,541
while other girls watched
Snow White and The Little Mermaid.

48
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,335
By eight, I picked out the criminal
on the show.

49
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,212
So, it was your talent.

50
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,631
No. It's the reruns.

51
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,052
As I kept watching the show,
I wanted to be a cop.

52
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,014
It's dangerous to be a cop.

53
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,599
I know.

54
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,478
Not everyone in the world can be brave.

55
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,522
So I decided to become brave.

56
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,203
That's cool, Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

57
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,249
So that's my story.

58
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,836
Tell me what kind of a king you are.

59
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,839
A young,

60
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,593
handsome, and rich king?

61
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,472
A rower,

62
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,223
a mathematician,

63
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,642
a well-grown orphan,

64
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,564
and the owner of the Four Tiger Sword.

65
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,361
A king who has never been asked
such a question

66
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,821
and is trying his best

67
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,366
not to panic.

68
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,997
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

69
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,378
Evidence that points
to another evidence...

70
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,592
-Prime Minister.
-Yes, I know.

71
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,345
Please hurry.

72
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,181
I know they asked you
to buy time but make it quick.

73
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,558
She's unbelievable.

74
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,561
Does she think the palace
is some kind of a supermarket?

75
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,273
The security team tried to buy time,
but it didn't really work.

76
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,526
What did she say she's here for?

77
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,821
I'm here to report to His Majesty
regarding national affairs.

78
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,743
We asked everyone
to send in a written report

79
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,413
unless it's regarding
a national emergency.

80
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,790
And everyone already agreed to that.

81
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,376
You can't just barge in here like this.

82
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,588
Do you want us to make it harder
for people to visit here?

83
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,967
Or do you just need us to teach you
the rules all over again?

84
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,219
Why don't you take a step back?

85
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,805
His Majesty is gone, isn't he?

86
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,851
I'd call that a national emergency.

87
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,270
I won't turn a blind eye to this.

88
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,149
And I won't let you hide it
regardless of your position in the palace.

89
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,445
His Majesty stayed in his study
all day long.

90
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,655
And he went to bed early today.

91
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,617
-I should've gone to his bedroom.
-You're crossing the line!

92
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,455
You're just a public official
who will be replaced in five years.

93
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,498
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

94
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,375
I haven't crossed the line yet.

95
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,504
Tell His Majesty
that I'll be waiting in his office.

96
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,549
-Please move aside.
-Stay right there!

97
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,678
I won't take a single step
from where I'm standing now.

98
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,180
That will cause trouble.

99
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,976
His Majesty is the only person
who has the right to stop me.

100
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,187
And I'm a lot stronger than you.

101
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,485
Ma'am!

102
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,195
How dare she...

103
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,288
Didn't I tell everyone to send me
written reports this week?

104
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,374
Yes, Your Majesty.

105
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,046
I told her so,
but she just barged in anyway.

106
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:31,344
Since you're up, why don't you just check
what she has to report?

107
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,387
Okay, then.

108
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,556
Will you please excuse us?

109
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,488
I was solving a problem
I've been working on for a while.

110
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,450
I'm sorry for worrying you.
I made you work until so late.

111
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,160
It comes with the job.

112
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,162
Did you solve the problem?

113
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,915
I was horrible at math,
so my answers were always

114
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,918
either zero or minus one
whenever I didn't know the answer.

115
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,254
That's interesting.

116
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,590
My answer was zero as well.

117
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,260
Lucky you.

118
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,304
My answer turned out to be incorrect.

119
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,975
By the way, you're a bit tan.

120
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,270
I thought you stayed in your study.

121
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,521
Really?

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,315
The study is in Gwangyeongjeon.

123
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,695
It gets lots of sunlight during the day,
and it's covered with stars at night.

124
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,783
It looks like my grandfather
spent a fortune building that place.

125
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,790
I haven't been able to laugh
due to all the issues.

126
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,543
I'm not here to report.

127
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,379
I just came to see if you were missing.

128
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,880
And I'm glad I came.

129
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,598
You're indebted to me now, Your Majesty.

130
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,977
Good luck with solving this one.

131
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,438
I'll see you next week.

132
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,276
Prime Minister Koo.

133
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,074
Let me tell you this.

134
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:22,038
I didn't want to offend you,
but this won't sound pleasant.

135
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,211
Every moment of my life
is the history of the Kingdom of Corea.

136
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,673
And I want that history to last forever

137
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,926
because I am the king.

138
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,304
But that will require

139
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,223
more than just my benevolence.

140
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,937
Therefore, I can never be indebted to you.

141
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,941
Let's wait and see
how my absence will be recorded

142
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,526
in the pages of history books.

143
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,445
Do you understand?

144
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,866
I'll see you next week.

145
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,306
Captain Jo, please excuse us.

146
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,224
Stay here.

147
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,143
Keep me and the royal court safe.

148
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,728
Come here.

149
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,398
You should be coming to me.

150
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,776
Then stay right there.

151
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,238
You must want to see me die of stress.

152
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,490
My goodness.

153
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,742
I missed you.

154
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,786
My goodness, gracious.

155
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,330
You're unbelievable! You really are!

156
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,795
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,091
It'll probably happen again,
but I'll try not to worry you next time.

158
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,303
My gosh, must I die to make you come back?

159
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,265
How are you going to make it to my funeral

160
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,017
if you travel so far away?

161
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,436
Let me guarantee this.

162
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,521
You'll live a long life.

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,315
See how hard you struck me just now.

164
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,692
It's based on science.

165
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,113
Prime Minister Koo barged in
as if she has a mole in here.

166
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,741
And the court ladies were all suspicious.

167
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,660
I was so worried someone might post
something on the internet.

168
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,706
My goodness, what in the world...

169
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,708
My gosh.

170
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,127
My goodness.

171
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,255
What... What happened?

172
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,467
Where are all your buttons?

173
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,013
Well... I had to use them urgently.

174
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,265
They used a different currency.

175
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,559
You never know

176
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,811
what life has in store for you.

177
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,440
My gosh, those buttons were worth so much.

178
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,942
I can't believe you used every single one.

179
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,069
Don't you have a lot of work to do?
Let's go.

180
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,362
Let me help you out.

181
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,492
His silence is making me anxious.

182
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,080
Lady Noh, Yeong just glared at me.

183
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,500
My gosh, I can't believe
you used all of these.

184
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,710
Didn't you hear me? He was glaring at me.

185
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,545
How could you use every single one?

186
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,255
-Are you listening?
-My goodness.

187
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,132
My goodness.

188
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,134
Lower the security level
for Prince Buyeong

189
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,844
and keep it at Level Green.

190
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,269
Your Highness.

191
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,193
The security level for you
has been lowered to Level Green, sir.

192
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,571
I guess His Majesty
finally came out of his study.

193
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,948
Thank you.

194
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,199
Salute.

195
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,412
Oh my goodness.

196
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,206
What in the world is...

197
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,542
What?

198
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,168
Wait.

199
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,129
What is...

200
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,297
Wait.

201
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,929
What is...

202
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,180
BBQ CHICKEN GOLDEN COUPON

203
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,808
What is this...

204
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,647
My gosh.

205
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,872
AZALEAS
SELECTED POEMS OF KIM SO-WOL

206
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,457
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

207
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,920
No. No way. Just no.

208
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,131
I didn't even start speaking.

209
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,466
I can tell you the whole story.

210
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,761
Hey, I told you to write a report.
What's taking so long?

211
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,472
She worked overtime last night.

212
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,767
She hung a towel around her neck
to impress you. Let's hear her out.

213
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,685
Gosh.

214
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,813
First, let's prepare the mind. Here.

215
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,443
I don't have to hear it.
I know what you're going to say.

216
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,406
From three months before the incident,
Lee Sang-do hasn't accessed

217
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,699
the gambling website.

218
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,035
It's probably because he had no money.

219
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,578
He could have had money.

220
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,371
Kim Bok-man changed the web address

221
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,457
multiple times
to escape the police dragnet

222
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,042
and lost a lot of members.

223
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,627
And guess what he did.

224
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,630
He gave a lot of points to new members.

225
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,591
It's why Lee Sang-do made a new account
under his wife's name.

226
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,594
But for three months before the incident,

227
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,639
he hasn't accessed it at all.
Even when he had points left.

228
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,142
Let's exclude murder

229
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,478
and put a gambling charge on him for now.

230
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,147
-We can charge him with murder later.
-You, too?

231
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,149
I know a bit about gambling addiction.

232
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,276
-How many points?
-3.7 million.

233
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,111
She has got a point.

234
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,697
How could he stay away
from 3.7 million in points?

235
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,241
If you get lucky enough,
you get 30 million won.

236
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,244
We are restoring Lee Sang-do's 2G phone.

237
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,623
It will take two weeks to restore,
so let's wait until then.

238
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,540
My gosh.

239
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,793
Exactly two weeks.

240
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,629
If you fail to find evidence in two weeks,

241
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,548
-I will kick both of you out.
-Yes, sir.

242
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,884
Division Two asked for help
for a robbery case

243
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,220
I don't want to see you. Get out.

244
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,137
Yes, sir!

245
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,764
I admire you.

246
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,269
Do you have the things from the pocket
of the buttonless jacket?

247
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,314
The things from the outer pockets
to the study

248
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,566
and the book from the inner pocket...

249
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
in the bedroom.

250
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,572
Get ready. We don't have time.

251
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,490
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,789
Last night,

253
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,500
the father of Captain Choe Gi-tae,

254
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,420
who was your superior in the army,

255
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,463
has passed away.

256
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,051
All your military colleagues
will be there.

257
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,595
It's a great chance

258
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:58,642
to dismiss the rumors
and show that you are well.

259
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,186
It's fortunate

260
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,690
that I came right on time.

261
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,110
You could have told us before you left...

262
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,621
Put this on before you go in
and please hold on for a while.

263
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,702
Thank you for coming, Your Majesty.

264
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,537
How have you been?

265
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,831
I am sorry for your loss.

266
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,459
May he rest in peace.

267
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,836
I was a bad son my whole life,

268
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,715
but I was lucky enough to be by his side
on his deathbed. He was laid to rest.

269
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,010
I have followed your lead and admired you

270
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,846
as you were an upright soldier.

271
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,935
I'm sure your father was proud of you.

272
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,605
Thank you for your kind words,
Your Majesty.

273
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,819
I saw you win the rowing competition.

274
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,197
I should've stopped you
from leaving the army.

275
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,119
Right. You wouldn't have been promoted
because you're not talented in combats.

276
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,496
-You came in last place.
-Last place...

277
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,415
I wasn't...

278
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,214
Hasn’t it been classified
as a national secret yet?

279
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,259
I heard you never leave Gwangyeongjeon,
so I was worried.

280
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,469
But I guess there was no need to.

281
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,722
Visit the bridge sometime.

282
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,100
You can come
as a discharged Navy Lieutenant,

283
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,727
or as the commander-in-chief
of the Kingdom of Corea.

284
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,229
Okay.

285
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,439
I will visit you.

286
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,125
BUSAN CATHEDRAL

287
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,821
Focus on driving only.
That is best for His Majesty's safety.

288
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,573
Yes, sir.

289
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,095
I see.

290
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,723
All we can see
is the wheel of the motorbike.

291
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,434
I knew she would get in trouble.

292
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,646
She always gets out of a taxi
in front of the store

293
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,440
and buys beer and cigarettes here.

294
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,193
And she's always drunk.

295
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,403
She is lucky that I'm a nice person.

296
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,864
If I weren't, I would've robbed her first.

297
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,289
How long have you been working here?

298
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,959
Are you suspecting me?

299
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,544
It's been less than a month.

300
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,089
Do you know the number
of the previous employee?

301
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,676
The culprit knew where the victim
was going to be, how much she'd have,

302
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,469
and even the blind spots of the CCTV.

303
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,179
Right. I see.

304
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,391
Hang on a second.
I have her number because of the handover.

305
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,561
Found it. Here you go.

306
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,071
Her number is
on the online secondhand market.

307
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,781
She's selling a red wallet.

308
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,998
Tae-eul, do you need a wallet?

309
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,125
Is a direct purchase okay?

310
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,295
Excuse me.

311
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,090
-Are you buying the wallet?
-Oh, right.

312
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,885
Can I see the wallet first?

313
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,558
Oh my. It's pretty.

314
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,186
It's almost brand new.
I didn't really use it.

315
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,855
I see.

316
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,108
I would've asked for a refund,
but I lost the receipt.

317
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,111
Will you wire me the money?

318
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,657
I think I will arrest you.

319
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,284
Ms. Kim Su-jin?

320
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,663
Where were you between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.
yesterday?

321
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,664
Who are you?

322
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,082
What the hell?

323
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,459
-Wait.
-It hurts.

324
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,960
-Wait a second.
-What?

325
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,256
Ms. Kim Su-jin, you are under arrest
for bodily injury and theft.

326
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,175
You have the right to an attorney,

327
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,304
and you have the right to remain silent.
You have all sorts of rights.

328
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,306
Let's go.

329
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,524
Fine. I'm coming.

330
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,448
-Detective Jeong, thank you.
-No problem. See you.

331
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,366
Bye.

332
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,753
Oh, hey.

333
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,630
Hi.

334
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,006
What are you doing here?

335
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,467
I'm working.

336
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,054
I haven't heard from you in a while,
so I was curious. How are you?

337
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,098
I'm busy every day.

338
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,475
What about your nightmares?
Is it better now?

339
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,187
What?

340
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,443
I've been having
sweet dreams too recently.

341
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,654
There's no way
you can be cured this quick.

342
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,074
You must still eat a lot of sweets.

343
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,868
It's better than medicine.

344
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,161
There is no way it is.

345
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,789
If sweets don't work, come see me.

346
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,548
Who is she?

347
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:49,719
I've never seen any woman who talks to you
except for testifiers, suspects,

348
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,304
and criminals.

349
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,600
Is that mystery man's horse
still at your place?

350
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,523
Don't change the subject. Who is she?

351
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,275
You're changing the subject.

352
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,154
He said he was a king.
Was anything stolen from your house?

353
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,198
He left to his home.

354
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,741
Where's his home?

355
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,911
I don't know where his home is.

356
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,803
Yeong. Are you going to keep giving me
the silent treatment?

357
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,018
What? Do you want me to hold your hand?

358
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,857
Give me your phone.
I'm going to install a GPS tracking app.

359
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,067
Because you kept...

360
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,863
staying in the study, I almost got fired.

361
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:50,906
You're lying.

362
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,200
You know what?

363
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,454
When it was first invented,
the GPS had large discrepancies

364
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,415
between the tracked location
and the actual location, but--

365
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,708
What's your ID?

366
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,044
"King," of course.

367
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,881
But when they applied
Einstein's theory of relativity

368
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,257
to the tracking process--

369
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,759
That ID already exists.

370
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,470
Who dare calls himself a king?

371
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,389
Go for "King Two."

372
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,226
Anyway, about the theory of relativity--

373
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,102
All Kings are taken until King 987.

374
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,814
Track the IP addresses of those 988.

375
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,359
Right now.

376
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,985
It's the king's order.

377
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,572
Currently, our shipbuilding companies
has bid for 120 vessels, 40 each,

378
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,076
in order to win the transportation rights
for the LNG from Qatar Gas,

379
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,412
which is one of Qatar's
government-controlled companies.

380
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:44,000
Therefore, it's inevitable for us
to compete with the Japanese.

381
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,754
We're already facing trouble
with our Japanese competitors

382
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,340
regarding the patent of our PRS system--

383
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,510
Did you prepare a presentation
to tell me that we can't do it?

384
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,430
I bet you asked your smart subordinates
to make the PowerPoint for you.

385
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,103
The Kingdom of Corea produces
rare-earth elements,

386
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,105
and has advanced processing technology.

387
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,148
And thanks to that, we have allies.

388
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:12,279
Figure out which country can help us
persuade Qatar as fast as possible.

389
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,366
Next, the Ministry of Agriculture.

390
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,744
Why haven't I still heard
about the pesticides found in eggs?

391
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,162
This is crazy.

392
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,248
-Is the Prime Minister inside?
-Yes, but--

393
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,583
Yes, I know. It's urgent.

394
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:26,918
Ma'am.

395
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,753
Ma'am.

396
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,131
I'm too tired to eat.

397
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,967
I'll have some red ginseng instead.

398
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,804
You need to see this. It's urgent.

399
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,893
She keeps saying
we need to spend more on national defense

400
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,187
when she doesn't even know anything.

401
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,856
That will only upset the Japanese.

402
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,402
Congressman Park was
at Jeguk University's homecoming event.

403
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,322
A few reporters from that university
were there, too.

404
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,326
I'm sick of hearing her say that.

405
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,705
Japan is our ally.
Are you trying to start a war with them?

406
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:08,668
I bet she only cares
about what she's going to wear every day.

407
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,838
What would she know about politics?

408
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,590
Look at her nose.

409
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,968
It can't be her actual nose.

410
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,138
My friend is the best cosmetic surgeon
in the country.

411
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,222
And I asked him.

412
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,224
Should I kill this jerk?

413
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,185
What?

414
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,187
Look at me. Does my nose look fake?

415
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,648
It's probably because it looks so perfect.

416
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,107
Right?

417
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,278
Then let's just make him regret
that he's alive.

418
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,705
Send this to Reporter Song.
Tell him it's exclusive.

419
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,712
My goodness.

420
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,800
Why did you keep...
I mean, where did you get this?

421
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,553
You've been working for me
for a year and a half.

422
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,390
You shouldn't be intrigued
by these kinds of photos.

423
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,975
What's the matter with you?

424
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,688
Do you really want to be a politician?
I'm really curious.

425
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,356
I'll send it right away.

426
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,826
Where do you get those kinds of photos?

427
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,037
I'm just really curious.

428
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,957
Why don't you have coffee outside?

429
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,376
You should drink near the campus.

430
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,962
And with someone handsome if possible.

431
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,607
Prime Minister Koo.

432
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,779
It's been a while, Prince Buyeong.

433
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,573
I'm glad.

434
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,241
What do you mean?

435
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,326
His Majesty has been away.

436
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,829
And seeing you make
journal entries like this

437
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,749
only means that you know that he's away.

438
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,876
I have no idea what you're saying.

439
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,670
His Majesty was in his study.

440
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:21,092
Once he begins studying mathematics,
he doesn't come out for days and weeks.

441
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,844
It happens a few times a year.

442
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,597
Could it be that he was out
every time that happened?

443
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,267
Whenever it happened,
the security level for you was elevated.

444
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,649
I'm just curious.
You were born as the son of the king,

445
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,569
but four generations of your family
can't be in politics

446
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,614
nor hold important posts.
You can only be a scholar.

447
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,283
Your children and grandchildren
must live abroad.

448
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,869
Are you okay with such a life?

449
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,039
People are jealous of the royal family.

450
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,291
Don't you think it's unfair?

451
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,252
Not once have I thought that way.

452
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,088
Is that so?

453
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,967
You were born to an ordinary family.

454
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,222
People love you
for your friendly and honest image.

455
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,393
I suppose class disparity
can never disappear

456
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,896
nor will it ever disappear in the future.

457
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,944
That's quite a dangerous statement.

458
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,864
I guess our conversation isn't so light.

459
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,034
So, what's your point?

460
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:33,289
Don't you think our current situation
is perfect to spark rumors?

461
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,708
Yes. Exactly.

462
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,556
A member of the ruling party
was just kicked out because of a scandal.

463
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,354
ASSEMBLYMAN PARK'S SEX SCANDAL

464
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,691
Will people think that you have my back

465
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,485
if I sit here with you like this?

466
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,237
I hope they do.

467
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,787
Your Majesty.

468
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,249
I'm here for a scolding.

469
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,712
Head Court Lady Noh made

470
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:25,592
tons of traditional donuts today.
I hope it's like the one up North.

471
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,887
It'll taste pretty similar
since Head Court Lady Noh made it.

472
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,305
Thank you for this.

473
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,058
Did you have fun, Your Majesty?

474
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,936
Where did you go this time?

475
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,937
This time,

476
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,691
I went somewhere very far away.

477
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,696
It was the most exciting trip ever.

478
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,409
If you're going to keep traveling,

479
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,579
at least get married and have a son.

480
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,624
You have a duty to carry on
the royal bloodline.

481
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,584
Gosh, you sounded so old.

482
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,378
I thought I was in the Joseon Dynasty.

483
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,431
My favorite photo is the one

484
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,477
taken during the spring trip
in elementary school.

485
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,564
Cherry blossoms are everywhere.

486
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,442
And I'm holding both your hand

487
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,821
and Head Court Lady Noh's hand.

488
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,493
The hand of my uncle who has to live
his entire life away from his family.

489
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,745
Your Majesty.

490
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,372
Don't you hate me

491
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,749
for that?

492
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,210
That's complete nonsense.

493
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,840
My father's stepbrother killed my father

494
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,134
and even tried to strangle me.

495
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:56,182
And because of me,
all your family has to live abroad.

496
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,518
All their lives.

497
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,561
So I'm curious.

498
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,357
Is my father's cousin

499
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,110
on my side

500
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,570
or not?

501
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,783
What are you asking, Your Majesty?

502
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,202
You're being absurd.

503
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,915
Do you want me to kill my own children
to prove my loyalty to you?

504
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,084
I couldn't bear

505
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,796
to kill my own kids,

506
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,549
so I forbade them from coming here
all their lives.

507
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,929
What kind of absurd rumor
has made you come this far?

508
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,431
I wasn't swayed

509
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,267
by any rumors.

510
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,562
That wasn't my question.

511
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,192
Are you hiding something from me?

512
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,904
I trust you,

513
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,865
and I admire you.

514
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,993
Please don't hide anything from me.

515
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,334
I've been trying to solve this
for a long time.

516
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,672
I can't seem to solve it,
so I'll leave it here with you.

517
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,575
AUTOPSY REPORT
LEE JONG-IN

518
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,085
What's wrong?

519
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,005
Do you think

520
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,342
the library is in the same place here?

521
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,636
The library?

522
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,784
THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE

523
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:36,963
When did you come?

524
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,050
Did you have dinner?
If you haven't, let's go eat out.

525
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,261
Where have you been?

526
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,931
I was with friends. You know the mothers
of your middle school friends?

527
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,641
Did you gamble again?

528
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,893
I told you not to...

529
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,187
Give me your bag.

530
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,149
I didn't. Come on. What's wrong with you?

531
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,735
Sin-jae, why are you doing this?

532
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,294
I got lucky today.

533
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,963
I won these.

534
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,133
Please, believe me. This is my last time.

535
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,301
Seriously, Mom.

536
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,096
This is way more
than how much you can earn!

537
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:41,277
Jangmi, I'm going to send you an address,
so go there right now.

538
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,655
Where's the house?

539
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,616
I said, where's the house?

540
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,454
Mom!

541
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,913
All right. Let's do this!

542
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,626
All right. Let's do it!

543
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,840
Let's go.

544
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,154
Jangmi, from now on, take pictures
of everything that has a face.

545
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,405
Yes, sir.

546
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,869
Hey!

547
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,705
Stop!

548
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,209
Is this a scam?

549
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,752
-What?
-What's this?

550
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,630
First, take your money back.

551
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,840
Look over here and smile.

552
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,843
Show me your eight teeth.

553
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:48,928
All right.

554
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,846
I'm dead if I get caught again.

555
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,225
Hey, you. The man who looks like
the picture on the card. Scoot over.

556
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,309
Look over here.

557
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,437
-Hey, you guys join the photo too.
-Sin-jae.

558
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,357
-Smile.
-Goodness.

559
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,819
My intuition's never wrong
about shit hitting the fan.

560
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,072
I was wondering who took my money,

561
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,074
and gosh.

562
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,992
It was your mother.

563
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,664
Did you have some meat with your son?

564
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,750
He said he was a builder and he'd do it,
so I believed him.

565
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,671
-I never saw him before. Believe me.
-Shut up and follow me.

566
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,425
Are you out of your mind?

567
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,468
How dare you touch a cop's body.

568
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,762
You want me to help you
remove your wrist?

569
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,514
Wow.

570
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,767
Looking at his build,
he looks just like one of us.

571
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,061
I told you to shut your mouth.

572
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,565
You're going away for a long time.

573
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,318
I will make sure
that your last meal will be in prison.

574
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,114
Sure. I should do as the policeman says.

575
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,366
But am I the only one going away?

576
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,411
The person who won my money
should come too.

577
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,745
Am I wrong, ma'am?

578
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,087
Mom.

579
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,214
Watch this.

580
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,306
Oh my.

581
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,767
Taking money from a jerk like this
makes me a joke.

582
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,645
And I can't work as a detective anymore.

583
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:25,608
-I need to quit, okay?
-You don't know how much money this is.

584
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,904
Come on, Mom!

585
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,699
There's been a report.

586
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,632
I made the report.

587
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,553
Detective Kang, this isn't right.

588
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,388
I won't go alone.

589
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,435
Arrest every single one of them here.

590
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,063
-Sin-jae.
-Sir.

591
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:04,980
Come with me.

592
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,275
Sin-jae!

593
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,610
I will stay.

594
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,197
Come on out.

595
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,909
I will wrap this up with them.

596
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,579
That's all I will do.

597
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,418
Sin-jae!

598
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,714
You can't just leave like this.
You should take me with you.

599
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,930
He's my son. I'm his mother.

600
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,431
Bye then.

601
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,434
My son is a detective! Sin-jae!

602
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,852
Bye, sir.

603
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,280
I'm sorry.

604
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,490
Should I try to get it out?

605
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,493
You can't.

606
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,954
It all went down the drain.

607
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,749
My performance assessment.

608
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,125
My promotion.

609
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,840
It's okay.

610
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,014
FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN

611
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,684
I know it was a mistake.

612
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,811
You can go now.

613
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,690
It's okay.

614
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,401
I'm fine.

615
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,035
Hey, Gyeong-ran.

616
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,204
Hey, where did that money come from?

617
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,289
Where did you get that bill?

618
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,167
-Where are you now?
-What's the matter?

619
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,549
What is it?

620
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,094
What is this?

621
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,261
What do you think?

622
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,931
It's a flyer.

623
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,142
Yes, it is. It's an advertisement.

624
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,187
But this is real.

625
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,565
It's real. Even down to its watermark.

626
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,442
Even his watermark is handsome.

627
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,277
What do you mean?

628
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,322
I know this sounds crazy,
but this is real.

629
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,741
The proportion of noil, ink,

630
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,202
and even the anti-forgery methods
are identical.

631
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,747
It's a real banknote printed by a bank.

632
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,932
THE KING RETURNS TO THE PALACE

633
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,231
Leaving the palace.

634
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,404
Returning to the palace.

635
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,040
So it happened.

636
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,502
My nephew

637
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,423
finally stands before the legend.

638
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,404
Father.

639
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,949
Father.

640
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,101
FOUR TIGER SWORD

641
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:01,443
"The sky bestows the heart upon us,
and the ground helps the spirit.

642
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,779
The sun and the moon are formed.

643
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:08,367
As the mountains and streams form,
lightning strikes."

644
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,413
"A sage is moved to defeat the evil
of the mountains and streams.

645
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:18,293
Wield it with deep thoughts
and make things right."

646
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,463
That is the calling of
the Four Tiger Sword.

647
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,844
Only the king can become
the owner of the Four Tiger Sword.

648
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,516
Do you think you can
fulfill this calling, Gon?

649
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,143
Yes, Father.

650
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,478
Even if

651
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,772
it requires you to eat beans

652
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,983
and spinach?

653
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,071
Then, maybe next time, Father.

654
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,913
All right. But why?
Is the challenge too steep for you now?

655
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,564
He was spotted twice.

656
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,858
But we can't find him.

657
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,110
He disappeared somewhere.

658
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,280
There's nothing but a bamboo forest.

659
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,199
I know.

660
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,362
Did you really come here?

661
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,490
Why?

662
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,850
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

663
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,357
Your Majesty!

664
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,111
Your Majesty!

665
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,240
Head Court Lady Noh is upset again.

666
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,617
She thinks you left the palace again--

667
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:21,935
2.71828182845904523536028747135...

668
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,272
She's searching everywhere.

669
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:30,193
-You should at least tell her--
-Wait. Let me check how many seconds.

670
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:36,658
2.71828182845904523536028747135...

671
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,410
What are you doing?

672
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,538
Time just stopped. It was the second time.

673
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,498
Did you feel anything?

674
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,710
-Are you saying your watch stopped?
-Of course, the watch stops, too.

675
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:48,920
Your Majesty.

676
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,007
Where were you this time?

677
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,843
A parallel universe.

678
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,887
Right...

679
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,930
"A parallel universe"?

680
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,768
Their capital is Seoul, and the statue
of Yi Sun-sin is in Gwanghwamun.

681
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,104
Their country is called
the Republic of Korea.

682
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:12,110
So you went to the parallel universe

683
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:16,615
where the capital city is Seoul,
and it's called the Republic of Korea...

684
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,366
Is the earth round or not?

685
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,245
I'll ask for a doctor.

686
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,831
-Ma'am!
-No, don't call Head Court Lady Noh.

687
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,625
-Ma'am!
-Hey, Unbreakable Sword.

688
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,168
Come here!

689
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,931
What is the other world like?

690
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,892
Which world is better?

691
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,609
RARE EARTH ELEMENT

692
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,069
We don't have this book here.

693
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:57,155
If you were going to bring something,
some gold would've been nice.

694
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,699
You said I exist over there too.

695
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,285
I don't need this.

696
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,956
Just make sure not to favor him over me
in the end.

697
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,169
You in the other world
told me to give you the book.

698
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,755
You on the other side

699
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,049
runs a bookstore.

700
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,988
You go to the charnel house very often.

701
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,990
It's for myself.

702
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,577
Who knows when I'll be dead?

703
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,705
Although, you'll never die.

704
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,209
You'll have to eat dinner by yourself.
Or you could eat out.

705
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,175
What's the matter with you?

706
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,468
Why don't you ever age?

707
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:28,872
At ease.

708
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,901
AUTOPSY REPORT

709
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,112
LEE JONG-IN

710
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,346
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Did I get any phone calls?

711
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,515
From whom, Your Majesty?

712
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,102
Never mind.

713
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,021
You can go home.

714
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,615
Why aren't you going home?

715
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,785
Did Lady Noh ask you to watch me?

716
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,663
Yes. And Ho-pil is outside the window
if you must know.

717
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,625
I'm telling you so you don't feel awkward
when you try to escape.

718
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,476
Okay.

719
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,228
With a white top,
your face will stand out too much.

720
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,648
We have clothes here,
so why don't you put on a jacket?

721
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,900
Okay.

722
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,573
Good.

723
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,659
-Now, let me take it.
-Hold on.

724
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,577
Okay.

725
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,038
Smile.

726
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,915
All right. Here we go.

727
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,251
One, two, three.

728
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,629
One more.

729
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,131
One, two, three.

730
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,221
REISSUE OF CIVIL SERVICE ID CARD

731
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,398
LOST AFTER A FIERCE SCUFFLE WITH A SUSPECT

732
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,567
Here.

733
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,280
When will it be ready?

734
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:53,243
Your ID card that I have was issued
on November 11, 2019.

735
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,454
Around late October.
It will take about a week.

736
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:02,168
Right? I don't have to wait
until November 11, do I?

737
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,087
No.

738
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,424
All right. Thank you.

739
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,373
Time stopped for a bit just now.

740
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:41,916
Didn't you feel it?

741
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,794
Everything stopped except for me.

742
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,965
But thanks to that,

743
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,426
I saw something beautiful.

744
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,224
What did he see?

745
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,878
The proposed salary raise for congressmen
was sent back to the assembly.

746
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,172
The Prime Minister won.

747
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,634
You seem happy.

748
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:33,968
Yes, Your Majesty.

749
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,930
If she serves another term,
she'll flirt with you less.

750
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,937
Are you worried
I might fall for Prime Minister Koo?

751
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,979
To be honest,

752
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,398
she's quite pretty.

753
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,610
Don't worry.

754
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,655
I know someone prettier.

755
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,615
You do?

756
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,832
What's wrong? Are you all right?

757
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,420
-I need my shoulder checked.
-Yes.

758
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,922
I want only Yeong to see it.

759
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:15,468
Don't worry, and don't tell
Head Court Lady Noh about this.

760
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,970
I have Captain Jo with me.

761
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:19,973
Yes, Your Majesty.

762
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,524
Drop the act. You can't fool me.

763
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,526
It really hurts.

764
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,652
Take a look.

765
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:34,862
Hurry.

766
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,369
What is this?

767
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,912
When did this start?

768
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,290
Not long ago.

769
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,835
-What's going on?
-Hang in there.

770
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,003
I'll call the doctor.

771
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,109
There's no record of calls and texts.

772
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,652
It's an unregistered burner,

773
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,530
so there are only three voice messages
recorded.

774
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:20,199
Thanks to the service provider,
we got them here.

775
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,369
It took more than two weeks
because the service provider was so slow.

776
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,414
You are the best.

777
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,458
-Thank you.
-Sure.

778
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,543
Thank you.

779
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,966
From August 1st to 4th,
the Global Medical Center

780
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:41,262
will be developing a training program
for the health workforce in Thailand.

781
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,640
For a successful business and research,

782
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,475
rehabilitation medicine of Sukhumvit--

783
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,935
This is the news.

784
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,230
Is this not Lee Sang-do's phone?

785
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,692
The head of the business,
Prof. Lee Jong-in says

786
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,403
an efficient development
of a training program--

787
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,615
Why did you lose your ID card?

788
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,076
Was it from a fierce scuffle
with a suspect?

789
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,371
Right.

790
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,917
Well... I think it might have been

791
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,252
the time your friend...

792
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,337
Well done.

793
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,215
How long have you been holding out
without the ID card?

794
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,842
-Don't you want a promotion?
-It hasn't been long.

795
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,387
I had to get it late October.
I forgot about it.

796
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,806
What do you mean? It was issued today.

797
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,016
Today?

798
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:38,861
Today is...

799
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,323
November 11?

800
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,660
They said you were accidentally left out.
They said sorry.

801
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,538
Right. Today is November 11.

802
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,541
It's garaetteok day.

803
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,252
I love you.

804
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,924
By the way, did you hear about the news?

805
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,010
-What news?
-We'll have this year's first snow today.

806
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,762
It's early this year.

807
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,307
Doesn't it feel like
some kind of a good omen?

808
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,768
What about an omen of a scolding?

809
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,186
I love you...

810
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,440
You can say that to her,
but I need an apology.

811
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,997
Lieutenant Jeong
of Violent Crimes Division Three.

812
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,540
It's me.

813
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,876
You haven't gone home yet. I'm relieved.

814
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,840
-What's wrong?
-What?

815
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,309
Let me answer it.

816
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:56,230
Hello?

817
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,107
You keep hanging up on me.

818
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,568
Do you get off late again?

819
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,946
I thought I'd go see you
since you might've waited for me.

820
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,410
I should get going.

821
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,742
Where were you?

822
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:33,911
My world.

823
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,538
Don't lie to me.

824
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,417
-I really did.
-You don't even know your name,

825
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,169
but you went home?

826
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:48,050
I never said I don't know my name.
I just said you can't call my name.

827
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,513
Then why did you come back?

828
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:57,184
There's some money I have to pay back,
and I need two more stamps for my coupon.

829
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,730
But I forgot the coupon
as I was in a rush.

830
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,609
And I was also wondering
if you were doing all right.

831
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,866
Now that I've paid back and saw you,

832
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,454
I should get going
because I sneaked out this time.

833
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,000
Do you really have a house?

834
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,376
I do.

835
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,212
I have a really big house.

836
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,841
There are many rooms
and it has a great view of the ocean.

837
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,801
And a large garden as well.

838
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,266
I have one question.

839
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,062
The picture on my ID card that you saw.

840
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,314
In that picture,

841
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,485
is my hair down or tied up?

842
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,780
So it was today.

843
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:55,117
Did you lose your ID card
while I was gone?

844
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,293
That's why it was today.

845
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,297
You got your ID card today.

846
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,633
Just answer my question.

847
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:12,969
In the picture,

848
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,514
is my hair down or tied up?

849
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,015
It was tied up.

850
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:35,658
Like this.

851
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,164
What am I wearing in the picture?

852
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,960
-The uniform, right?
-No.

853
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,963
Just a navy jacket.

854
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,425
It can't be.

855
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,726
Do you want to see for yourself?

856
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,771
You can come with me if you want.

857
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,818
Come with you where?

858
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,089
Come with me.

859
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:34,341
To my world.

860
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,055
If you're lying again, you are so dead.

861
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,267
-Where should I go?
-You can't get there by car.

862
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:09,794
Hold the rope tightly.

863
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,672
I will hold you.

864
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:15,466
Giddy up!

865
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,076
I must be crazy.

866
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:44,995
We've been here before.

867
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,456
I'll seriously kill you.

868
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,085
You'll regret having said that.

869
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,921
Whatever happens, don't get too startled.

870
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:55,923
Just trust me.

871
01:08:58,759 --> 01:08:59,760
Giddy up!

872
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,370
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

873
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,624
I command the royal guards
to take ten steps back.

874
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:17,963
You too, Yeong.

875
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:20,841
She seems too shocked.

876
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,391
Is he...

877
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,645
Yes.

878
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,064
In your world, he's Eun-sup.

879
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:41,987
See?

880
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,531
I was right, wasn't I?

881
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:01,215
I'm the king of the Kingdom of Corea.

882
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,469
And my name, which you cannot say,

883
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,014
is Lee Gon.

884
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:45,175
Welcome to my palace.

885
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:48,220
-I didn't want to leave you alone.
-It's just my type.

886
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,639
-What have you done to His Majesty?
