00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,879
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

2
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,304
What the hell

3
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,681
do you think you're doing right now?

4
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,184
I've...

5
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,772
finally met you,

6
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,359
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

7
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,931
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

8
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,101
Can't you see my ID?
I'm a police officer. What are you doing?

9
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,186
That was a greeting.

10
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,814
-What?
-Because I'm happy to see you.

11
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,191
So, you were across the universe.

12
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,320
You really existed.

13
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,159
And after 25 years,
you're still a lieutenant.

14
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,747
LIEUTENANT JEONG TAE-EUL
BIRTHDATE: MAY 27TH, 1990

15
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,295
How do you know my rank?

16
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,715
I have been watching you for a long time,
although you may not believe me.

17
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,384
If you knew I wouldn't believe you,
why say such bullshit?

18
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,803
I will ask you again, sir.

19
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,847
Show me your ID.

20
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,849
I'm afraid I can't.

21
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,102
-I don't have an ID.
-Why don't you have an ID?

22
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,270
Because I am

23
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:08,938
who I am.

24
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,817
I guess you won't believe this either.

25
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,570
What the...

26
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,781
It seems that my feelings are conveyed,
and you are confused,

27
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,117
so I will sum up the current situation.

28
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,703
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

29
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,539
I crossed the dimension
with lightning and thunder

30
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,250
while chasing after a suspicious person
and arrived here.

31
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,669
I was confused for a while,

32
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,880
but after giving it some thought,

33
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,259
I came to the conclusion
that this is a parallel universe.

34
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,639
This is a parallel universe?

35
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,058
It's a bit different,
but let's not get into the details.

36
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,309
There's already one thing

37
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,228
that makes a big difference.

38
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,899
QUEEN YUNA
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LEGEND

39
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,361
It seems that this country
is ruled by a Queen in this universe.

40
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,655
And she seems to be pretty beloved.

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,616
We do love our Queen Yuna.

42
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,035
She's loved by the whole nation.

43
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,453
Just like I am.

44
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,123
Now, escort me to your Queen,

45
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,292
and give well-dried grass and water
to Maximus,

46
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,544
my seventh-grade official.

47
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,755
How am I supposed to take you

48
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,923
to Queen Yuna?

49
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,967
You've got to buy a ticket.

50
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,721
There seems to be something wrong
with our conversation.

51
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,600
-Am I right?
-Now you're talking sense.

52
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,435
This is annoying.

53
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,396
He must be a movie star.

54
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,526
-He must be a celebrity.
-Take a picture of his face.

55
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,909
So, you're saying

56
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,620
you came from a parallel universe,

57
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,790
where you are
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

58
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,419
And there was lightning on your way here.

59
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,130
And the horse is a seventh-grade official.

60
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,966
Is that what you're saying now?

61
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,594
It looks like you don't understand
what a parallel universe is.

62
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,305
Did you not study science?

63
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,350
Who is this half-crazy bastard?

64
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,647
Is this what your personality is like?

65
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,149
Yes.

66
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,153
My personality has been like this
for about 30 years now.

67
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,529
Why?

68
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,740
I have never imagined it.

69
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,327
I thought you would be softer...

70
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,413
This is new.

71
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,914
Sure.

72
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,750
Enough with the self-introduction.

73
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,710
Let me introduce myself now.

74
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,760
You didn't show me your ID,
you violated the traffic law,

75
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,306
and you touched the body
of a police officer on duty. Right?

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,019
You have the right to an attorney,
and you have the right to remain silent.

77
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,354
If you move, it will only hurt more.

78
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,570
I am the King of the Kingdom of Corea--

79
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,448
My arm. My arm!

80
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,575
EPISODE TWO

81
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,202
FORENSIC SERVICE

82
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,376
-What a handsome white horse.
-What is it?

83
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,253
-What's going on?
-It looks so pretty.

84
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,379
It makes a great photo.

85
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,090
Where did you come from?

86
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,299
It looks great.

87
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,177
-I haven't seen a real white horse.
-What's this?

88
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,223
Let me ask you again.

89
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,101
What's your name?

90
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,646
I can tell you,
but you cannot call me by that name.

91
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,397
That's my answer again.

92
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,441
The name is not meant to be used.

93
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,986
Then let's say it's "Kim Gae-ddong"
for convenience's sake.

94
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,404
"Gae-ddong" as in "dog poop"?

95
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,909
You could have called me
"Hong Gil-dong" or "Mr. so-and-so."

96
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,661
And my family name isn't even Kim--

97
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,372
Mr. Kim Gae-ddong,
take out all your belongings

98
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,414
and put them here.

99
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,167
If you disobey the order,
I will take them out myself.

100
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,847
I will check your belongings.

101
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,433
THE KINGDOM OF COREA

102
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,902
Right, there was one there, too.

103
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,988
Think of it as the concern

104
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,575
of the Head Court Lady
over the Royal Ancestral Shrine.

105
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,909
Good luck.

106
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,211
-100,000 won bills?
-What's wrong?

107
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,880
Don't you have those bills here?

108
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,631
Did you play Monopoly yesterday?

109
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,842
-Did you buy much land?
-Will you keep talking down to me?

110
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,469
You've talked down to me
since Gwanghwamun.

111
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,138
-I'm three years older than you.
-Does that matter right now?

112
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,599
Goodness. It looks quite real.

113
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,312
There's a chance that this may've been
involved in crime or fraud,

114
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,105
so I'm seizing it.

115
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,196
-When will we get the result?
-In about two hours.

116
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,324
Bring it to the office.

117
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,992
Okay. I'll bring it to you straight away.

118
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,079
What's that?

119
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,958
You don't have an ID,
you failed to identify yourself,

120
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,128
and you've been uncooperative with police.
You know that, right?

121
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,547
I need your cooperation
with the fingerprint identification.

122
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,384
No one is allowed to touch my body.
Even you--

123
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,810
Don't think that you just overpowered me.

124
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,855
I have trained my body
with all kinds of exercises.

125
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,441
You seem to not believe me.

126
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,152
I hope to be able to prove it.

127
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,072
Rowing, horse-riding,
taekwondo, fencing, boxing...

128
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,629
His Majesty went out again?

129
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,132
Yes.

130
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,344
He went out without permission again
in the early evening.

131
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,555
I thought so, since my security level

132
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,390
has been elevated.

133
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,226
Where has he gone this time?

134
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,395
Did he go see the ice cap again?

135
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,063
No, not there.

136
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,274
He left all his winter clothes.

137
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,444
This time, I have no clue.

138
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,574
Captain Jo assumes that he disappeared

139
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,785
through the bamboo forest
near the racetracks.

140
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,959
Just until this summer,
he was shameless about running away.

141
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,545
This is no laughing matter.

142
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,507
You should really knock some sense
into him this time.

143
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,176
Don't ask him if he had fun this time.

144
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,721
But that's my biggest interest.

145
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,307
So, what should we say this time?

146
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,642
We've already used acute gastritis

147
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,312
and acne caused by the change of season.

148
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:11,110
Why don't you use the method
that you used a year ago?

149
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,321
Let's say he cooped himself up
in his study

150
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,740
because he has math fever again.

151
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,202
Let's say he even has the Prince over
to help him solve math problems.

152
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,707
I guess I should stay here
for a few hours.

153
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,044
Looks like we'll have another rush
of applicants for science and engineering.

154
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,504
This is so frustrating.

155
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,302
Captain Jo said he's searching,
so let's hope he finds something.

156
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,989
The CCTVs caught him pass by
the sixth point but not the seventh point.

157
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,868
This bamboo forest
is the only thing between them,

158
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,703
but the footprints stop here.

159
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,376
It means he disappeared here,

160
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,544
which makes no sense.

161
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,048
I'll check the footage again
to make sure we didn't miss anything

162
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:14,965
and search again.

163
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,258
Right.

164
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,385
That makes sense.

165
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,722
Either you missed something,
or I missed what you missed.

166
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,809
You two take care of it.
Just the two of you.

167
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,811
-You know what I mean.
-Yes.

168
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,438
I will be on outside duty,
so call me to keep me updated.

169
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,316
Right.

170
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,363
You said His Majesty went to check
if it's a clock or rabbit, right?

171
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,781
Yes.

172
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,283
Seriously, we are innocent.

173
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,829
We had no idea that His Majesty was there.

174
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,957
We were trying to catch the bitch
that ran away with our boss' money

175
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,999
and ended up there.

176
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,418
-That's what happened.
-Hey.

177
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,296
That bitch doesn't have a home
nor does she have an identity.

178
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,174
We must get her while she's in our sight.
Otherwise, we can't.

179
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,927
Please be generous.

180
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,595
You see, we did some investigating,

181
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,891
and what they say
mostly corresponds to what happened.

182
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,269
-Did you find the woman they were chasing?
-Not yet.

183
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,062
We have our eyes on her too,

184
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,190
because she's committed
various crimes like theft and assault.

185
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,734
But we don't know her face or her name.

186
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,487
Rather, we got tips from these guys.

187
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,990
-What is she called again?
-Luna.

188
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,575
Luna, it is.

189
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,869
I will call you as soon as we catch her.

190
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,455
Please prepare
the CCTV footage of her as well.

191
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,414
I will.

192
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,331
Hey.

193
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,501
Hey.

194
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,212
Give me a cushion to sit on.

195
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,630
Or at least a chair.

196
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,050
I have never sat on the floor before.

197
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,680
I know you can hear me.

198
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,057
Is he the person you talked about?
Prince Charming?

199
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,784
JO EUN-SUP

200
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,253
Yeong.

201
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,048
Is that you, Yeong?

202
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,216
What's your problem?

203
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,386
I'm here.

204
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,471
This way.

205
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,767
He says he's not a prince but a king.

206
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,102
-He says he can't sit on the floor.
-I see.

207
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,646
See? I knew you could hear me.

208
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,654
Yeong, I had no idea
that you would follow me.

209
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,239
He's a little scary.

210
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,784
Director Jeong asked me
to pass this to Squad Three.

211
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,369
This...

212
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,246
is for the delivery.

213
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,795
He's not

214
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,172
Yeong.

215
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,384
He's not.

216
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,345
Yeong? You keep saying that name.
Who is that?

217
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,555
My name is Jo Eun-sup.

218
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,432
Why do you answer him? Don't talk to him.

219
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,018
One should not ignore what others say.

220
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,770
There is a horse outside.

221
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,273
It was one dashing horse.

222
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,817
Are you the owner of the horse?

223
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,738
He's like King Arthur.
King Arthur rides a white horse, you know.

224
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,615
I loved that cartoon.

225
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,783
Did you see it?

226
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,160
Wait.

227
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,540
My, look at that watch.

228
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,499
What is it?

229
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,714
At least you have good taste.

230
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,885
It's the only watch in this world
that was made

231
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,929
to celebrate the first victory of Maximus,
my fine horse.

232
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,389
Right.

233
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,224
There are two worlds now.

234
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,061
It's the only watch in two worlds.

235
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,606
Yeong would have recognized right away

236
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,525
that the accurate watch
doesn't go faster or slower

237
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,528
even by one tenth of a second.

238
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,238
I get it.

239
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,449
He speaks with elegance,
just like his horse.

240
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,534
I wish my horses were as elegant.

241
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,662
-I do have horses too, you know.
-You do?

242
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,123
Horseradish, sawhorse,

243
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,250
Red Horse.

244
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,045
Eun-sup.

245
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,758
It's seven already. Aren't you going home?

246
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,010
Wait.

247
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,805
I didn't want to say this,

248
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,310
but please lay it
on at least a piece of paper.

249
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,271
It has never been laid on the floor.

250
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,065
He seems pretty ill.

251
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,859
This is why I told you not to talk to him.

252
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,320
I should get going.

253
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,452
FORENSICS TEAM
GYEONG-RAN

254
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,704
You can't find his identity? At all?

255
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,791
Are you saying he's an unidentified man?

256
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,584
There must be some record.

257
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,212
I know. But we found nothing.

258
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,507
I haven't seen any adult over 30
whose fingerprints aren't registered.

259
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,511
It's a rare case,
but there's a chance that he was a child

260
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,763
that went missing
before registering his fingerprints.

261
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,184
Take his DNA sample and send it
to the Women and Juvenile Division.

262
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,770
And I will have to take a look
at the bank notes again.

263
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,940
I don't know who made it,
but it looks like real money.

264
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,191
Good luck.

265
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,318
Okay, bye.

266
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,072
Gosh, I dug my own grave.

267
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,325
Seriously, who are you?

268
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,328
Open your mouth.

269
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,297
You tried to identify my fingerprints,
but you failed to identify me.

270
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,258
Is that right?

271
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,801
It means

272
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,679
I don't exist in this world.

273
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,851
And the two worlds
aren't exactly the same.

274
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,148
Will you keep talking nonsense?

275
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,192
-I said, open your mouth.
-Just like I don't exist here,

276
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,570
you didn't exist in my world either.

277
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,364
It took me a while to find you
and some effort to confirm it.

278
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,408
Your affiliation was questionable,

279
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,327
and a photo of you and your birthdate
was the only lead I had.

280
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,712
A photo?

281
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,006
Are you saying you have a photo of me?

282
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,717
Why?

283
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,261
Why do you have a photo of me?

284
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,182
Seriously, what are you?
You said this the moment you saw me.

285
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,142
"I've finally met you."

286
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,436
Why did you finally meet me?

287
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,397
You had better worry about your life.

288
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,400
Anyone who talks down to me like you
gets beheaded.

289
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,321
Are you a spy?

290
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,865
Is your mission
to explode this police station?

291
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:59,328
-Is that why you secretly investigated me?
-You don't look that important...

292
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,164
-Do you know me?
-I was curious about you,

293
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,665
and I thought about you a lot.

294
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,667
You also look better in real life.

295
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,760
That young man is the Captain
of the Royal Guards in my world.

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,554
Some people don't exist in both worlds,
like you and me.

297
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,225
So, this is a parallel world?

298
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:22,935
Prove it.

299
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,603
The proof is right in front of you.

300
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,189
I came

301
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,566
from the other world.

302
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,621
Why...

303
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,457
do you look at me like that?

304
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,376
How else should I look at you?

305
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,586
Make sure they don't give me
the wrong idea.

306
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,214
Right now,
your eyes are those of a criminal.

307
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,173
A petty criminal.

308
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,969
-Do you have any other proof?
-Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

309
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,056
To help you understand,
I will give you a simple explanation,

310
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,099
so listen carefully.

311
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,478
Quantum mechanics,
which Albert Einstein discovered...

312
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,361
You know, I don't know about other things,
but I know my eyes are charming.

313
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,779
I was born with deep-set eyes.

314
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,575
What about the quantum mechanics
which Albert Einstein discovered?

315
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,326
Did the mechanics fix a car or something?

316
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,212
Quantum mechanics,
which Albert Einstein discovered,

317
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,339
led to the parallel universe theory,

318
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,218
which states that our universe
consists of particles

319
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,013
that can exist in two places

320
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,140
if particles that form substances

321
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,601
can be waves as well,

322
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,062
just like light can be both waves

323
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,440
and particles at the same time,

324
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,319
and therefore suggests the possibility
of the existence of parallel universes.

325
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,743
I guess that didn't help.

326
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,039
The theory where our universe--

327
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,754
Thanks for the speech.

328
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,550
They are all idiots.

329
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,970
I thought I'd see only gorgeous men
once I became Prime Minister.

330
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,263
But you...

331
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,812
But you formed the cabinet.

332
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,940
I know.

333
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,777
I chose them to shoot in the foot.

334
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,613
-So, that was it for today, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

335
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,324
I will see you tomorrow.

336
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,545
Was the state administration
article published?

337
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,713
Yes.

338
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,676
Here.

339
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,514
And starting from tomorrow,
His Majesty's schedule is open for a week.

340
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,598
So, I had a look into it

341
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,309
and the security level for Prince Buyeong
has elevated, as expected.

342
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,979
So, the King ran off again.

343
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,778
Maybe he has a woman.

344
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,863
That woman is here.

345
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,408
If the King has a woman,
that woman has to be me.

346
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,077
I'm trying to make
the whole nation believe that,

347
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,121
so it would be bad
if he has another woman.

348
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,456
Is she young? Is she pretty?

349
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,419
Chances are pretty high.

350
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,837
Get out.

351
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,088
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,481
THESE ARE THE FACES
OF THE KINGDOM OF COREA

353
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,607
THEY LOOK CUTE TOGETHER

354
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,946
IS THE KING AND THE PRIME MINISTER
ON A DATE?

355
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,197
He was right.

356
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,160
The left side of my face looks prettier.

357
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,165
The lipstick was a bit too much.

358
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:22,007
I'm letting you go because I'm a good cop.
Consider yourself lucky.

359
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,134
I was bound to be freed
after 48 hours anyway.

360
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,387
-There was no reason to arrest me.
-Yes, but you got out earlier.

361
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,224
How can I contact you
when I get the DNA test result?

362
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,225
Right.

363
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,852
Well...

364
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,986
You can contact me here.

365
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,988
I heard this was near your place.

366
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,574
-Who said that?
-That young man from earlier.

367
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,658
ROYAL INFINITY HOTEL

368
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,619
Was his name Eun-sup?

369
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,497
I heard he was your junior in high school.

370
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,042
And I also heard that your father runs
a taekwondo center.

371
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,505
Do you even know
how expensive this hotel is?

372
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,256
This is a five-star hotel.

373
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,051
-Do you have money?
-I don't, but I can get some.

374
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,137
Where's the nearest jewelry shop
around here?

375
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,977
This is a diamond.

376
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,771
It's a diamond?

377
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,733
If that's a diamond, I'm Princess Diana.

378
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,656
I have been a gemologist for 40 years,

379
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,076
and I haven't seen a diamond
with such delicate cuts.

380
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:36,039
I would say
it practically has no inclusions at all.

381
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,958
Goodness.

382
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,044
Where did you get this?

383
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,421
I will ask where they bought it later.

384
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,423
The Head Court Lady is in charge.

385
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,718
How much can you give me?

386
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,845
Well...

387
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,348
It's a fine product,
but there's no warranty.

388
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,310
And a fine diamond like this
includes risks.

389
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,606
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

390
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,985
-Are you a cop?
-Yes.

391
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,322
Tell him about your other identity.

392
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,574
Princess Diana.

393
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,548
You seem confused.

394
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,759
So, what's with the diamond?

395
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,179
Did you steal it?

396
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,559
Have you ever seen someone bring a cop
while trying to sell a stolen diamond?

397
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,108
Who knows?
Maybe that Head Court Lady or whatever

398
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,484
stole it.

399
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,820
I will ask her that too.

400
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,199
She's not the kind of person, though.

401
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,371
What is that, by the way,

402
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,372
Princess Diana?

403
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,086
It's the 63 Building.

404
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:06,922
Why?

405
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,925
Does your world
not have something like that?

406
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,553
We have 63 of those in Haeundae.

407
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,514
-Is that the only one here?
-Yes, it's the only one.

408
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,142
You can take a taxi across the road
to get to the hotel.

409
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,231
Are you leaving?

410
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,733
Why?

411
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,568
Don't go.

412
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,657
It took 25 years for me to meet you.

413
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,285
I hope

414
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,372
today will be a long day.

415
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,749
Get out of my way.

416
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,253
I already had a long day today
because of Kim Gae-ddong.

417
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,927
LEE SANG-DO'S WIFE
TESTIFIER

418
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,680
Hello?

419
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,808
Is this Mr. Lee Sang-do's wife?

420
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,187
Yes, I can. I will be right there.

421
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,568
Hey, Lee Sang-do's wife
answered the phone.

422
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,279
Okay. See you at the hardware store.

423
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,912
I think it's been about three weeks
since my husband left home.

424
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,001
Why didn't you report him missing then?

425
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,462
It's not like this is the first time
he ran away after we fought.

426
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,340
I just thought he might
be gambling somewhere.

427
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,593
This time it lasted a bit longer, though.

428
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,765
Is there anyone
who might hold a grudge against him?

429
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,559
To be honest,

430
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,479
whoever killed him, it would make sense.

431
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,775
He borrowed money from everyone he knew.

432
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:55,447
He borrowed money from everyone,
carrying two phones around.

433
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,158
Now I have to pay for all the debt...

434
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,564
My, she grew by leaps and bounds.

435
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,406
-Hello?
-This is a collect call.

436
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,366
Eun-sup.

437
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,701
It's me, King Arthur.

438
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,537
Please pick up the phone.
I need to talk to you.

439
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,749
If you wish to continue the phone call,
press the pound key.

440
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,250
He's out of his mind.

441
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,340
Come in.

442
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,342
Wow.

443
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:01,221
I'm glad I managed to convince you
after 13 attempts.

444
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,223
This suite is awesome.

445
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,476
By the way,

446
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,729
why did you bring me here?

447
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,648
I wanted to catch up with you.

448
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,316
"Catch up"?

449
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,735
We've got nothing to catch up with.

450
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,656
Everything in your left hand is all yours.

451
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,366
Do you want me to sit over there?

452
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,327
So, what should we begin with?

453
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,538
I want to see a photo of your family.

454
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,290
It would be better if it was from
when you were very young.

455
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,795
Most people usually don't carry around
photos like that,

456
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,798
but I looked the best then.

457
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,091
Hold on.

458
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,217
All right.

459
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,057
There it is!

460
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,060
Why do you want to see the photo, though?

461
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,649
I was right.

462
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,695
This is a parallel world.

463
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,490
Hey, do you want to die?

464
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,952
Answer your phone before I kill you.

465
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,037
You freak. A horse?

466
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,707
Are you serious? You told him, didn't you?

467
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,001
Pick up the phone already,
or I will kill you.

468
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,336
Answer me! You are so dead.

469
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,258
Someone is texting you.

470
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,427
A warning of murder.

471
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,396
I heard you had a broad yard.

472
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,108
Please take good care of Maximus,
my seventh-grade official.

473
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,194
What in the world is this?

474
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,070
It doesn't make any sense.

475
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,322
It looks so well-fed.

476
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,658
It doesn't seem to be a regular horse.

477
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,995
-It's a seventh-grade official.
-I knew it.

478
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,290
Tae-eul, are you sure the man
who left this horse is the owner?

479
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,959
If he is, you must not let him go.

480
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,545
Not many people in Korea own horses.
He must be incredibly rich.

481
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,130
-Is that so?
-Yes.

482
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,966
See that? Old sayings are always right.

483
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,219
"Nice horses for nice horses,

484
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,347
soft horses turn away wrath."

485
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,598
That's right.

486
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,017
It sounds somewhat off, though.

487
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,685
-Delivery!
-What do you mean?

488
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,270
Hey, take a picture of it.

489
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,191
Did you order fried chicken?

490
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,192
-Yes.
-Delivery.

491
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,693
Thank you.

492
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,112
I ordered some food.
You should have some.

493
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,949
-Come here.
-I have got no appetite.

494
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,119
Dang, I really am in trouble.

495
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,163
Kim Gae-ddong!

496
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,750
A moment of your time, please.

497
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,003
Has a well-built man
in his early thirties,

498
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,256
around six-foot-one with a likable face,

499
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,091
checked into this hotel today?

500
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,761
I'm sorry, but we are not permitted
to give out information--

501
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,804
Yes, I know.

502
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,931
You don't need to tell me.

503
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,224
Hold on a second, please.

504
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,733
The horse you left at my place.

505
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,944
I bet I can sell it for a good price.

506
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,738
I'm giving you ten minutes.

507
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,623
Please deliver this message to his room.

508
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,557
That was nine minutes and forty seconds.
Close call.

509
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,018
The suite is on the upper floors,

510
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,312
so it took five minutes
for the manager to come up.

511
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,230
-I headed down as soon as I could.
-Sit.

512
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,648
I was about to.

513
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,485
Should I sit here like this?

514
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,196
What are you going to do about the horse?

515
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,949
If it's okay with you--

516
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,451
It's not okay with me.

517
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,494
I will feed him and brush him myself.

518
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,704
Stop stating the obvious.

519
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,997
It's only for a while.

520
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,999
I can't stay here for long.

521
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,918
I must return to my own world.

522
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,589
Could you lend my dear Maximus
just 16 square meters of your lawn?

523
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:08,009
Isn't that my entire lawn?
When are you going back to your world?

524
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,636
I haven't decided yet.

525
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,638
You should have done that first.

526
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,056
I should have,

527
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,808
but I postponed it for later.

528
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,393
I like

529
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,521
being here with you like this.

530
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,696
And you went shopping in the meanwhile?

531
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,744
I was out shopping for Eun-sup,
and the clerk asked me to try it on.

532
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,664
I tried it as I needed
a change of clothes,

533
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,668
and it looked so good on me.

534
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,920
I wasn't asking a question.
It was an insult.

535
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,296
Never mind.

536
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,841
I'll look after the horse
until the DNA test result comes in.

537
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,802
Why are you tying your hair?

538
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,928
Don't tie your hair.

539
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,724
Focus, will you?

540
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,769
I'm going to look after your horse.

541
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,729
Animals are innocent,

542
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,108
but Kim Gae-ddong might not be.

543
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,611
So, stay out of trouble until then.

544
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,489
Unless you want to find out
how much your horse can sell for.

545
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,500
That was scary.

546
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,464
The cause of death
is blunt force trauma to the head.

547
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,133
The stage of rigor mortis shows

548
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,677
that the body was disposed of
in the trunk after death.

549
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,972
Taking into account
that the decaying process was quick,

550
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,141
the death was three weeks ago.

551
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,935
The victim Lee Sang-do
left home three weeks ago.

552
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,896
-Did you figure out what the weapon was?
-Yes.

553
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,149
One is the wound on the corpse,

554
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,443
and the other is on the suspect,
Kim Bok-man.

555
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,696
The two wounds are identical.
There's one weapon.

556
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,406
It must be something quite heavy.

557
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,617
Could it be something like this?

558
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,039
A lever?

559
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,833
I don't see why not.

560
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,003
It's often used
at the National Assembly too.

561
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,507
Could this be

562
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,801
what made these wounds?

563
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,846
I guess it could be.

564
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,307
-Let's find the weapon first.
-Okay.

565
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,062
BOTTLES, METAL, STYROFOAM

566
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,238
Hello?

567
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,158
It seems that there's a dish called
budaejjigae in your world.

568
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,494
I would like to try it.
If you are free sometime--

569
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,374
Hello?

570
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,460
I'm in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace,

571
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,629
and they happen to be reenacting
a royal event.

572
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,214
Why do they say it's for the last king?

573
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,007
Did something happen to Queen Yuna--

574
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,427
Hello?

575
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,513
I just discovered
something very interesting.

576
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,432
It turns out the bakery that makes
my pre-meal bread

577
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,934
exists in this world too.

578
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,895
What's odd, though,

579
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,939
is that everyone here is tasting--

580
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,865
Excuse me.

581
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:18,991
Thank you.

582
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,661
I wouldn't mind if you used it for longer.

583
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,412
That would be dangerous.

584
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,457
I suppose she's tying up her hair now.

585
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,834
I see.

586
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,628
I would like to have this one packed.

587
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,672
This is a sample.

588
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,384
Here.

589
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,593
No.

590
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,262
I want this.

591
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,222
Excuse me?

592
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:05,288
I'm sure you have a good car, a secretary,

593
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,040
and other better things to do.

594
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,627
Why are you doing tough work like this?

595
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,047
This dancheong has 300 years of history.

596
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,259
Painting over it like this

597
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,262
is as if I am covering it
with another history.

598
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,935
A history of my own.

599
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,145
I see.

600
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,646
That's why

601
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,526
your color seems to have depth.

602
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,381
Good.

603
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,095
Thank you so much
for coming to Myeong-ho's birthday party.

604
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,556
Don't say that. We should thank you.

605
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,350
It's fun.

606
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,606
Okay. So, enjoy the food and have fun.

607
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,816
Right. I got him a present.

608
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,365
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

609
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,449
Thank you.

610
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,577
Hurry. Take a picture.

611
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,623
Look at his face.

612
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,089
He looks ugly in this one.

613
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,133
This one?

614
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,763
It would be nice if you could
play soccer with Myeong-ho one day.

615
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,517
Now, shall we blow out the candles?

616
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,851
We were just about to leave.

617
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,062
We're going to play on a trampoline,

618
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,480
but Myeong-ho can't do that.

619
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,398
Let's go.

620
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,412
-I want to go to the toilet.
-Sure.

621
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,038
No, I can go by myself.

622
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,667
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,419
We were too loud, weren't we?

624
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,464
What did you pray for?

625
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,758
Well...

626
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,011
I wish that my son could...

627
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,813
I wish my son could walk.

628
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,524
That will not happen.

629
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:26,530
Your child will never get to walk.

630
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,741
However,

631
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,204
you can make those children limp.

632
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,043
Would you like to change the prayer?

633
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,887
Three elementary students
have been seriously injured

634
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,056
by a truck while jaywalking.

635
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,518
It is unlikely that the three students
will make a full recovery.

636
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,855
We must review the speed limit
in school zones.

637
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,233
Is there a happy occasion to celebrate?

638
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:04,860
Yes.

639
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,738
It's my dead son's birthday.

640
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,741
I'm sorry.

641
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,705
Why are you sorry?

642
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,333
Just finish what you were doing.

643
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,153
Ms. Song Jeong-hye, are you inside?
It's the police.

644
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,367
I'm here because of your son, Ms. Song.

645
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,745
Your son...

646
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,666
tripped at a reservoir and drowned.

647
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,128
Your husband was killed in a hit-and-run.

648
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,422
Both your husband and son

649
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,133
had suspicious deaths.

650
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,677
Now, the whole world

651
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,555
will accuse you.

652
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,769
What do you want to do now?

653
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,858
Do you want redemption?

654
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,088
How pathetic you are.

655
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,299
You've sinned by laughing once,

656
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,722
and now you can never laugh again.

657
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:10,486
LEE JI-HUN

658
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,622
This is the record of the blackmailing
text messages the victim sent you.

659
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,917
He sent dozens of messages a day,
saying that you should watch out

660
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,835
and that he would kill you.

661
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,172
He even found the address
to your apartment and blackmailed you.

662
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:39,515
Detective, you shouldn't let
such trivial texts fluster yourself.

663
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,017
I didn't kill him.

664
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,271
A bloodstain was detected in your place.

665
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,939
That's my blood.

666
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,610
I was going home after drinking
and someone hit the back of my head.

667
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,696
Is that so? When was that?

668
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,243
Tell me the exact date, time,
and your whereabouts on that day.

669
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,289
I think it was three weeks ago.

670
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,332
Wait. Maybe it wasn't that long ago.

671
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,709
Damn it. I don't know.

672
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,378
When I regained consciousness,
I found myself at home.

673
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,255
The floor was all bloody so I wiped it.

674
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,634
It's not your blood.

675
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,761
It corresponds to the victim's DNA.

676
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,558
Lee Sang-do attacked you
with a weapon first and you murdered him

677
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,518
with the weapon.

678
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,854
Where is the weapon?

679
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,108
What weapon? I didn't do it.

680
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,445
Go ask at the bar.
I'm a regular customer there.

681
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,951
NUMBER ONE

682
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,708
Wait.

683
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,129
It's Lee Sang-do.

684
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,385
I checked the CCTV,

685
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,181
and it's certain that Lee Sang-do
followed Kim Bok-man three weeks ago.

686
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,309
Lee Sang-do followed him
to the entrance of his apartment building,

687
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,853
and his whereabouts after that
is unconfirmed.

688
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,108
The CCTV at the apartment is useless.
The footage is only kept for a week.

689
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,070
It seems pretty simple now.

690
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,905
All we need to do is find the weapon.

691
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,031
The weapon?

692
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,991
It's ten. Let's go home.

693
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,577
-Let's go home.
-Wait.

694
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,958
How did the owner of a hardware store,
who is just an ordinary man,

695
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,796
find Kim Bok-man's phone number
and home address?

696
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,634
There's no information whatsoever
on Kim Bok-man's website.

697
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,303
Why would he hire a private detective

698
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,430
when he had so much debt?

699
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,724
I guess he didn't mind
having a little more debt.

700
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,934
You see,

701
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:51,355
when one loses money and loses their mind,
they can do anything.

702
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,817
We might need to hire a private detective
ourselves to find the weapon.

703
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,985
Tomorrow, we need to scavenge--

704
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,904
That's a good point. Let's go home.

705
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,617
Let's go home.

706
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,868
Let's go.

707
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,428
Open your mouth.

708
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,723
You seem like a high-class horse,
so I got an organic one.

709
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,518
What's the matter?

710
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,937
Is it not good enough
for a seventh-grade official?

711
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,273
Does it have to be fresh from the farm?

712
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,066
My goodness.

713
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,781
Why do I feel like you just got mad at me?

714
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,703
Where's your owner?

715
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,464
Hey, Eun-sup.

716
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,965
Where are you now?

717
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,019
THE KOREAN WAR, A NATIONAL TRAGEDY

718
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,315
He's been doing that for three days now.

719
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,485
I gave him a cushion to sit on
and fed him after work.

720
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,237
I will feed him today.

721
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,914
Why is she sitting there?

722
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,917
Is she his girlfriend?

723
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,168
He had a girlfriend?

724
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,179
Are you from the Louvre Museum?
You're like a sculpture.

725
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,640
A nation that forgets its past
has no future.

726
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,016
Drink this and keep it up.

727
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,809
Most people here seem very kind.

728
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,229
They kept giving me things like this.

729
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,232
And I discovered something important.

730
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,026
In this world,
this country has a presidential system.

731
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,027
Well done.

732
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,156
She's leaving.

733
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,282
Is he going with her?

734
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,077
Please don't go.

735
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,037
-Oh, no. Don't go.
-Please don't.

736
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,849
Why aren't you eating?

737
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,102
I don't eat food
that wasn't tasted beforehand.

738
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,312
I could be poisoned anytime.

739
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,565
Is that so?
Then how have you been eating food here?

740
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,899
Eun-sup did it for me.

741
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,568
You made him taste your food?

742
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,195
I didn't even have to.
He always eats first.

743
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,657
So, are you saying
I should taste your food?

744
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,616
No.

745
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,412
If this food is poisoned
and I'm dying here,

746
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,583
what I'm saying now will be my last words.

747
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,672
Shoot.

748
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,383
Thank you for everything.

749
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,678
Because you existed somewhere,

750
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,014
I was less lonely

751
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,182
for the past 25 years.

752
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,040
How can food

753
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,167
taste like this?

754
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,336
I haven't tasted anything like this.

755
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,880
Do you not have any chicken in your world?

756
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,299
We don't have ones
covered in sauce like this.

757
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,556
It tastes excellent.

758
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,768
What did you do in the library?

759
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,187
I read about your world's history.

760
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,522
I wanted to know how different it is
from my world's.

761
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,149
So, how is it different?

762
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,943
The history of this country separated
since Prince Sohyeon.

763
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,155
In your world, he passed away early,

764
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,033
while in my world,
he remained in history as King Yeongjong.

765
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,534
He stopped the Qing invasion.

766
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,913
The history of the two worlds
started to go separate ways since,

767
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,498
and ended up here now.

768
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,084
It seems that in your world,
the country has quickly grown

769
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,836
through intensive industrialization
since the war and division.

770
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,380
I was impressed.

771
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,256
Do you write novels online?

772
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,467
Is that what you wrote until now?

773
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,303
Do you think it's here?

774
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,349
The reason why I survived that day.

775
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,813
Even on a night like that, a baby is born.

776
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,356
Isn't it great?

777
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,610
That night,

778
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,863
I heard the sound of a flute.

779
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,721
Do you think
it was the sound of Manpasikjeok?

780
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,597
No way.

781
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,393
Manpasikjeok doesn't make any sound,
Your Majesty.

782
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:22,894
That's not true.

783
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,439
I definitely heard it.

784
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,941
That's why I went to Cheonjongo.

785
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,986
I couldn't hear anything

786
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,655
because the flute was too loud.

787
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,075
I couldn't even hear the gunfire.

788
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,460
I didn't know you remembered everything

789
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:51,923
because you have never mentioned
what happened that day.

790
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,469
I held onto two things

791
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,929
that night.

792
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,682
I'm asking if one of them

793
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,353
is in the whip you are holding.

794
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,862
Also, whether or not
you have the other one.

795
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,783
That's right.

796
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,830
I have been keeping it in secret,

797
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:28,835
and I brought it to give it back to you
despite my fear.

798
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,924
What an odd thing it is.

799
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,385
Something that is silent made a sound,

800
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,807
and something
that cannot be identified exists.

801
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,188
Which is why I wished

802
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,733
you had forgotten everything.

803
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,997
Is this a secret between us?

804
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,376
Yes, Your Majesty.

805
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,588
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

806
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,798
Do you think it's here?

807
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,758
The reason

808
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,928
why I survived that day.

809
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,475
Why do you never believe

810
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,936
anything I say?

811
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,437
Is that how belief works?

812
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,191
Am I supposed to believe
nonsense just like that?

813
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,320
I'm the type of person who still can't
believe the Earth is round.

814
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,239
But a parallel universe?

815
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,241
Pre-meal bakery?

816
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,160
Stop your nonsense
and eat before it gets cold.

817
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,205
Just do one thing
before we get your DNA test result.

818
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,874
Do nothing.

819
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,168
If you don't believe me,
why do you help me?

820
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,504
Is it some sense of duty?

821
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,048
You only need that
when you have to save the country.

822
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,425
Then why?

823
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,011
There's no reason. I just do it.

824
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,221
I'm a police officer
of the Republic of Korea.

825
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:09,811
Anything else?

826
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,982
Is there any other reason?

827
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,444
The reason why
I have to stay in your world.

828
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,946
Could there be a reason?

829
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,315
EXHIBITION FROM KING TAEJO
TO THE LAST KING SUNJONG

830
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,247
I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.

831
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,314
Goodness. What was that?

832
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,317
Wait. You are Jo Yeong.

833
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,862
Where did you buy this?

834
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,655
It's our class uniform.

835
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,074
I suppose we ordered them online.

836
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,535
Please excuse me.

837
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,412
Can I take a picture with you?

838
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,705
No.

839
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,675
They said they would call me by today,
but I still haven't heard back.

840
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,510
I guess it means I didn't pass.

841
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,512
Where are you? Let's go grab a drink.

842
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,098
Hang on a second.

843
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,101
Hey, I'll call you back.

844
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,062
THE ROYAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE

845
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,398
Hello?

846
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,816
Yes.

847
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,651
That's me.

848
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,072
The final interview? Really?

849
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,740
Okay.

850
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:10,909
Okay.

851
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,496
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

852
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,374
Are you Ms. Myeong Seung-a?
I work for the Royal Guard--

853
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,211
Jo Yeong. You're really him.
This is unbelievable.

854
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,921
That's right. I'm Jo Yeong.

855
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:28,009
Is this the camera that you were holding
at the rowing competition?

856
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,053
May I see the photos?

857
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,222
What?

858
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,641
Sure. Take a look. Here.

859
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,896
Did you know I was here?

860
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,856
Yes, I knew you were here.

861
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,817
Oh, you did.

862
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,361
How?

863
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,081
Thanks for your cooperation.

864
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,459
Could you please send me
the photos by email?

865
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,460
Wow.

866
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,921
I guess these photos are helpful.

867
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:08,633
I don't know yet,
but I might find a clue later.

868
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,426
Here's my email address.

869
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,928
He's so cool.

870
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,096
I can hear you.

871
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,305
Really?

872
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,032
Did you investigate the assailants
from the rowing competition?

873
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,036
Yes, but they seem unrelated
to His Majesty's absence.

874
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,789
I found one lead, though.

875
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,916
It's the woman that caused the incident.

876
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,586
It seems that His Majesty
was after that woman as well.

877
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,503
Wait.

878
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,590
His Majesty was after whom?

879
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,133
A woman?

880
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,219
I just saw the White Rabbit
with the clock.

881
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,555
It's just my suspicion.

882
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,891
I will let you know
when I find concrete evidence.

883
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,729
-Make sure to investigate thoroughly
-Yes, ma'am.

884
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,982
The talismans haven't been working,

885
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:10,445
so I was just about to go
and grab the shaman by the hair.

886
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,449
I might end up bowing to her
to show my appreciation.

887
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,654
One, two, three.

888
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,527
I think that car owner will understand me.

889
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,781
Welcome.

890
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,410
Weren't you just in the yard?

891
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,830
Wait. Are you the owner of the horse?

892
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,376
It's nice to finally meet a citizen
who recognizes me.

893
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,169
As you probably have assumed,

894
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,213
I am the owner
of the seventh-grade official, Maximus,

895
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,215
who is staying in the yard for a while.

896
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:57,802
I am also
the King of the Kingdom of Corea.

897
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,471
What an interesting character you have.

898
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:04,559
If you don't mind, I would like to have
a cup of tasted milk tea.

899
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,563
It's 5,800 won and you need to pay first.

900
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,844
Hey, I'm in the yard. Come on down.

901
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,307
Give me five minutes.

902
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,602
Were you home?

903
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,189
He appeared at the Gwanghwamun Junction,
on horseback.

904
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,692
He seemed a bit crazy,
but he's good-looking.

905
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,737
I found no one
that matches his fingerprints.

906
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,322
But he was handsome.

907
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,825
I heard Tae-eul got herself into
a difficult situation with a handsome guy.

908
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:03,993
Have you seen him?

909
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,998
Hey, Eun-sup is waiting. You can go first.
I'll join you after hanging the laundry.

910
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,292
What should we order? Half and half?

911
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,960
-Hey, wait--
-Sounds great!

912
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,059
I know that I have just met you,

913
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,188
but what exactly is the relationship
between you and Lieutenant Jeong?

914
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,731
The relationship between
Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny?

915
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,609
The relationship between two and three?

916
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,152
The relationship between
Hongdae and Kondae?

917
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,571
What do you mean?

918
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,949
If you know we just met,
then why do you say such bullshit?

919
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,409
That's what I meant.

920
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,078
Stand there.

921
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,502
It's a mug shot. Just in case.
I heard you're unidentified.

922
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,003
Stand there.

923
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,299
Are you crazy? What was that?

924
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,051
Just in case you are my savior.

925
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,012
I wished you weren't, and you aren't.

926
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,347
Who is this crazy bastard?

927
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,058
I've heard that many times
since my arrival, although...

928
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,853
that doesn't mean you can say it, though.

929
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:15,106
Every word you say is beyond common sense.

930
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,983
You had better watch what you say.

931
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,359
Beheading is my kindest offer.

932
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,827
What do you think
my kindest offer is, then?

933
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,789
I'm kindest when I've just met someone.

934
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,630
Which means if I see you again,
there will be more than just kind words.

935
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,016
Yes, I'm coming.

936
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,816
I still have no clue
what relationship he and Tae-eul have.

937
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,463
Father!

938
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,633
APRIL 2006

939
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,555
Are we living in the Joseon era or what?

940
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,517
How could you accept eggs for tuition?

941
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:39,565
Well, Min-gu's family sells eggs...

942
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,944
and they have too many left this month.

943
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,782
You know, it takes quite a while
to go to the supermarket to buy eggs.

944
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,868
It's all protein.

945
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:55,498
You're saying nonsense.

946
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,625
How can you pay the rent
for the center with this?

947
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,503
I told you that you should help the kids
with their homework.

948
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,631
You can't teach
the five tenets of taekwondo

949
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,633
to the kids that want pink belts.

950
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,468
By the way,

951
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:10,972
why haven't you shown me
your report card from April?

952
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,473
Tell me.

953
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,018
It's been four months
since you entered high school,

954
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,062
and I haven't seen any report card.

955
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,240
Father,

956
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,451
I have a good idea.

957
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,830
It's a brilliant idea.

958
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,207
The idea just crossed my mind,

959
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,585
and I think it will work.

960
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,427
-Want to play pool?
-You are so bad, but if you insist.

961
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,721
Hey, you are the worst.

962
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,139
Hey, wait.

963
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,231
Let's go.

964
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,527
TAEKWONDO

965
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,603
It doesn't work.

966
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:41,520
Taekwon!

967
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,856
I told you I wanted to get
the double eyelid surgery.

968
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,900
You will get it when you're older.

969
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,693
Do it properly.

970
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,697
Keep holding up. Then you will get it.

971
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,034
All right. Let's do it again. Taekwon!

972
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,327
Taekwon!

973
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,496
Good. Let's do it again.
Keep your voice up.

974
01:05:58,579 --> 01:05:59,455
Taekwon!

975
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,248
Taekwon!

976
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,092
I told you it was a brilliant idea.

977
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:19,850
Someone actually came.

978
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,144
All right. At ease.

979
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,940
That's it for today. Let's take a bow.

980
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:30,069
Thank you for the lesson!

981
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,329
What are you doing here?

982
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,999
I know what "half and half" means too.

983
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,543
I'm coming with you.

984
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:46,752
No, you aren't.

985
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,547
Have quality time
with your seventh-grade official.

986
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:11,485
Anything else?

987
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,780
Is there any other reason?

988
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:18,034
The reason why
I have to stay in your world.

989
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:20,661
Could there be a reason?

990
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,657
Why are you still here?
Will you keep standing here?

991
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,493
You...

992
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,037
really shouldn't treat me like this.

993
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,288
Why not?

994
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,499
Because it upsets me.

995
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,919
-What?
-Why would you leave me?

996
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,962
You are the only person I know
in this world.

997
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,259
You are driving me crazy.

998
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,638
Fine. Since you brought it up,
let me ask you.

999
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,307
Why am I the only person you know
in this world?

1000
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,310
You act like you know me,
but I don't know you.

1001
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,270
How do you know me?

1002
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:31,857
I acquired your ID card 25 years ago.

1003
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,318
To be precise, someone lost it.

1004
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,362
Twenty-five years ago?

1005
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:37,822
Who lost it?

1006
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,741
I'm still looking for the person.
They seem to be related to you.

1007
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,159
Of course.

1008
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,454
If that person had my ID card,
they have to be related to me somehow.

1009
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,790
Let's say what you are saying is true.

1010
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,750
But 25 years ago,

1011
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:51,627
I was only five.

1012
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,381
Of course, I was more than qualified
to become a detective when I was five.

1013
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,258
But still, you fool,

1014
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,969
how would someone
find my ID card 25 years ago?

1015
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,930
I don't know how,
but the ID card that I have

1016
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,141
was issued on November 11th, 2019,

1017
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,268
and I've been waiting for that day.

1018
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,774
November 11th?

1019
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,196
That's Leonardo DiCaprio's birthday.

1020
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,535
I totally forgot about him.

1021
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,621
Were we just meant to be?

1022
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,668
Hey, Mr. Kim Gae-ddong.

1023
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:34,962
You're having delusions.

1024
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:37,673
Seriously,

1025
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:41,635
stop this and go see a doctor
with the money you got from the diamond.

1026
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:42,970
I don't have any left.

1027
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,138
Right. It's...

1028
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,059
I'm not just saying this.

1029
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,020
You must have a family,

1030
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,148
and they must be worried about you.

1031
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:55,900
Family...

1032
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,866
Is that what you wanted to know?

1033
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,576
Yes, it is.

1034
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,995
Okay, then. I will give you an answer.

1035
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,665
I'm still single.

1036
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,502
What are you trying to say?

1037
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,630
Which means
I don't have any immediate family.

1038
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:21,050
Therefore, I have just made
a very important decision.

1039
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:26,263
I am going to give you the position
where you have to know who I am.

1040
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,098
Fine.

1041
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,059
Give it to me. What is it?

1042
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,978
I wish I could understand you.

1043
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,369
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

1044
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,039
I take you...

1045
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,417
to be my wife, the Queen.

1046
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,922
-What?
-You just became the reason.

1047
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,466
The reason...

1048
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,844
why I should stay in this world.

1049
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,848
Goodness.

1050
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:15,521
He isn't half-crazy,
he is completely crazy.

1051
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:25,424
-I have been longing for you for 25 years.
-Be quiet!

1052
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,093
-You will be beheaded for cutting me off.
-I can't stand you!

1053
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,970
-What is this logo?
-I left the palace for too long.

1054
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,472
Where are you?

1055
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:32,806
I can stop time.

1056
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,517
I think it's a side effect
from crossing the gate.
