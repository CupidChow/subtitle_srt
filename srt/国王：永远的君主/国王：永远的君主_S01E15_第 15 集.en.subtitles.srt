1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,980
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,619
You really came to Gwanghwamun.

4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,792
And you're wearing a jacket
with a lot of buttons.

5
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,503
This is strange.

6
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,839
You seem to know me.

7
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,855
Let's skip that.

8
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,860
If I don't do this now,
I'll probably regret it later.

9
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,208
When it's fate, there are no coincidences.

10
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,503
It is inevitable by nature,

11
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,924
but when you realize its meaning,

12
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,469
it's always too late.

13
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:29,357
DAD

14
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,283
-Dad.
-Hey.

15
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,869
I got your call
and beat up all those guys.

16
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,245
Where are you?

17
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,291
You got my call?

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,252
Hey, what's wrong with your voice?

19
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,799
Hang on. The police are here.
They're asking for me.

20
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,134
I'll call you later.

21
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,192
-Is that a person?
-Oh my gosh.

22
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,153
Excuse me, are you okay?

23
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,864
She's bleeding badly.
We should call an ambulance.

24
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,785
So you're saying
that my mom met Lee Gon's,

25
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,206
I mean, Lee Ji-hun's mom?

26
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,250
At the Grace Heritage Hotel.

27
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,963
Start with the security camera there.
You'll be able to track Song Jeong-hye.

28
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,882
Will you help me?

29
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,010
Why did you follow my mom?

30
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,056
Are you going to help me?

31
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,158
Hello?

32
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,289
It's been a long time.
I believe your name was Hyeon-min.

33
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,916
Kang Hyeon-min.

34
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,715
You must have lost your mom.

35
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,634
I'll find her for you.

36
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,761
Who are you?

37
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,931
How can you look the same as before?

38
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,602
That's right.
That's why I thought I had a lot of time.

39
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,776
But now that I think of it,
that was the first crack.

40
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,738
My nephew was just a baby back then,

41
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,492
but now he's all grown
and he's almost caught up to me.

42
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,287
Enough with your family issues.
Tell me why you called--

43
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,798
It's time for you to repay me
for changing your life.

44
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,017
A mother
who was deceived her whole life,

45
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,811
and a mother
who deceived her whole life.

46
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,731
The lives of both your mothers

47
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,899
depend on you.

48
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,077
Just get to the point.

49
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,912
What do you want?

50
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,167
You're someone who is far from
yet close to my nephew.

51
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,337
This is a very easy deal.

52
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,882
Bring me Lee Gon's whip,
whatever it takes.

53
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,887
And it'll be even better
if you kill him in the process.

54
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,100
Can't you suggest a normal deal?

55
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,062
I'm not a good son.

56
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,064
I'm not that devoted.

57
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,190
You should be.

58
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:02,487
I'm sure you have an affection
that's sweet and melts quickly.

59
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,711
So, Hyeon-min.

60
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,882
Let's just die together.

61
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,009
-Let's die together.
-No!

62
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,469
-Hyeon-min!
-Mom!

63
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,137
-Mom!
-I'm sorry.

64
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,639
I'm really sorry!

65
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,142
It will only take a second.

66
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,228
-I'm so sorry!
-Stop...

67
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,229
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,482
Don't mind us, and just be on your way!

69
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,861
Your name is Min Seon-yeong.
And your son is Kang Hyeon-min.

70
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,078
Is this your thumbprint?

71
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,295
I said I'd pay by tomorrow.

72
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,673
I still have one day left.

73
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,341
Did you pray?

74
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,264
If you want to throw away your life,
why not give it to me?

75
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,893
I will give you and your son a new life.

76
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,398
You will be a palace worker
named Park Suk-jin,

77
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,569
and your son will have a rich father.

78
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,906
Who are you? What are you on about?
How would you do such a thing?

79
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,663
You...

80
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,498
Are you...

81
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,709
Prince Imperial Geum?

82
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,045
You're supposed to be dead.

83
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,720
You just need to nod

84
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,515
and grab a hold of the luck
that came to you.

85
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,233
What is it?

86
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,653
-Are my palm lines strange?
-It's interesting.

87
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:54,033
This scar connected with your fate line,
and became your new fate.

88
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,995
What kind of fate?

89
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,790
Well, since this is just for fun,
I'll tell you.

90
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:05,086
Your fate is to commit treason
if it were the old times.

91
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,339
Will it succeed?

92
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,925
Well, that's the problem.

93
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,930
You're fated to be beheaded,
I mean, if it were the old times.

94
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,017
So in other words,

95
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,479
you failed.

96
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,315
If you're actually me,

97
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,194
you should be keeping your sword here.

98
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,294
That fate has already passed.

99
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,256
I took part in the beheading myself.

100
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,635
Although it was foolish of me to do so.

101
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,015
I should've trusted myself

102
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,518
and killed the crown prince first.

103
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,605
The crown prince?

104
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,941
Na-ri! Hello, Na-ri!

105
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,779
Why are you holding hands?

106
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,072
It's so cheesy.

107
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,824
I've joined a palm-reading club.

108
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,368
-Should I read yours too?
-Yes.

109
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,715
You look familiar.

110
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,015
My gosh. Where did I see you before?

111
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,853
He is the traitor's follower.

112
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,064
Get him!

113
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,405
-Stay right here behind me.
-Yes, you saw me at Haeundae.

114
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,617
Can you relay a message
to my nephew?

115
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,579
I don't know where he's hiding right now,

116
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,875
but I'd really love to see him
on the memorial day of his mother.

117
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,171
Tell him I'll be attending
the memorial mass.

118
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,217
And that if he doesn't show up,

119
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,473
I'll be visiting
your fortune-telling friend again.

120
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,530
Who is he? Do you really know him?

121
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,534
Stay right here, okay?

122
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,786
I need to call Tae-eul.

123
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,915
-She's right over there.
-What?

124
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,751
Tae-eul!

125
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,587
What's going on?

126
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,383
Lee Lim came by just now.

127
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,009
You know, Lee Lim.

128
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,013
Here? Where's Dad?

129
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,766
He went to pick up the kids.
He couldn't cancel the class.

130
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,561
-What's all this fuss? Who is he?
-I'll tell you later.

131
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,024
Hey, what happened to your forehead?

132
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,028
-What are you doing here when you're hurt?
-You're hurt? Where? Why?

133
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,533
Something happened. Let's go, Sin-jae.

134
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,451
Jeong Tae-eul.

135
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,620
You were stabbed on your left side.

136
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,373
Oh, right.

137
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,375
I'm right-handed.

138
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,552
What's going on?

139
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,514
Eun-sup, take care of Na-ri.

140
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,601
What's with your forehead?

141
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,312
I asked him already,

142
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,482
-but he's not answering.
-Shut up.

143
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,168
It's you, Jo Yeong.

144
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,216
Don't look at me like that.

145
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,678
-We're from the same country.
-If I saw you there, you'd be dead by now.

146
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,889
Who put you up to this?

147
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,100
Who told you to poison the king?

148
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,269
Is it Lee Lim?

149
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,481
Narcotic painkillers.

150
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,108
They're prescribed for late-stage cancer.

151
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,070
-Do you have cancer?
-Yes.

152
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,324
I'm going to die soon.

153
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,410
But don't get too excited.

154
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,498
Can you two give us a moment?

155
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,458
I'll talk to her.

156
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,419
Call me, then.

157
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,882
Call me if anything happens.

158
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,017
So

159
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,395
you came to kill me

160
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,231
because you have cancer?

161
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,400
What do you need?

162
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,068
A liver? A kidney?

163
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,657
Is that why you avoided my organs
when you stabbed me?

164
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,119
So it's true.

165
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,750
There really isn't
even a hint of anxiety in your eyes.

166
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,590
You're the one who called my dad
and told him, right?

167
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,926
Why didn't you stab me
deep enough to kill me?

168
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,352
Homemade soybean paste is the best.

169
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,605
The soup is amazing.

170
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,403
I didn't want to upset your dad.

171
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,407
What did you talk about with my dad?

172
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,870
I heard you were at my house
when I wasn't here.

173
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,332
We talked about food,

174
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,834
money,

175
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,295
and work.

176
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,339
It was all about you in the end.

177
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,181
Sitting here like this,

178
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,143
feels like I'm looking into a mirror.

179
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,939
Tell me about yourself now.

180
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,152
You're a sentimental one, aren't you?

181
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,181
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD THREE

182
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,395
Oh my gosh!

183
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,439
How can we help you?

184
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,734
Is Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul here?

185
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,411
Is it April, 2020 right now?

186
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,123
Excuse me,
but how do you know Detective Jeong?

187
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,422
I've finally come to the year 2020.

188
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,508
Where is Lieutenant Jeong right now?

189
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,222
My name is Lee Gon.

190
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,059
Where have you been?

191
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,812
I told you that you need rest.

192
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,191
And if you came to the hospital,
you should head to your room.

193
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,985
What are you doing here?

194
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,033
I'm waiting for someone.

195
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,341
He's here.

196
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,219
He's over there.

197
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,260
How have you been?

198
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,514
You've been waiting for me?

199
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,266
I missed you.

200
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,187
I missed you so much.

201
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,480
I'm sorry.

202
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,566
I'm sorry

203
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,779
for keep making you wait.

204
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,157
I'm sorry.

205
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,203
I'm sorry.

206
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,035
Don't go.

207
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,876
-I won't.
-Don't go tomorrow, either.

208
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,839
I won't.

209
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,843
Lie down.

210
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,387
You got scolded for not getting rest.

211
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,402
I guess you'll leave when I fall asleep.

212
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,489
I really won't.

213
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,451
Do you need proof?

214
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,262
You're still wearing that.

215
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,393
I wanted to change,
but I had no money for clothes.

216
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,688
Oh, no.

217
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,860
I was happy that you came to see me

218
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,404
when I was five

219
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,782
and when I was 27.

220
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,580
I was happy that you hugged me

221
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,668
when you saw me at Gwanghwamun.

222
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,964
I thought you were crazy
both times you came.

223
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,593
I thought my two visits
would have been endearing.

224
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,554
I didn't think you'd ask for my ID again.

225
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,648
Do you remember

226
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,736
what happened between us after that?

227
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,287
Unlike the first time,

228
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:32,165
I believed half of his claims
about being the king of the Kingdom,

229
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,836
understood the concept
of parallel worlds a bit faster,

230
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,422
and went to his world a little earlier.

231
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,592
I still bought flower seeds
and scattered them,

232
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,681
and decided to embrace my fate
a little earlier,

233
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,936
but what was bound to happen
happened anyway,

234
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,691
and ironically,
the tragedy came earlier as well.

235
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,422
Fate did not change.

236
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,760
Is there no way

237
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,221
for us to change fate?

238
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,015
I'm sure there isn't.

239
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,354
There's no way
that fate can be broken so easily.

240
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,275
The larger the fate,
the more you need to walk

241
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,903
to reach your destination.

242
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,950
We just haven't reached
our destination yet.

243
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,086
Get some sleep.

244
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,129
No.

245
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,616
Yeong.

246
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,535
Your Majesty?

247
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,338
Kang Sin-jae?

248
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,843
Could you please pass the phone
to Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul on your left?

249
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,887
It's you, right?

250
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,683
You called me in front
of the chicken place about four years ago.

251
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,268
Yeong.

252
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,231
Was it really you
at the rowing competition?

253
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,068
I guess I did arrive at the right year.

254
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,070
You two have aged quite a bit.

255
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,782
You can even travel back in time now?

256
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,078
It is a relief that you are all right.

257
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,915
I found Song Jeong-hye.

258
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,835
I got a lot of help from Detective Kang.

259
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,465
I guess I have a lot to repay you.
Thanks for your help.

260
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,717
Then repay me.

261
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,387
Repay me for your food
and the ride I gave you.

262
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,805
What do you want?

263
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:36,850
Your life.

264
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,063
You must have met Lee Lim.

265
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,316
He must've used your two mothers.

266
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,445
Did Lee Lim tell you to kill me?

267
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,367
Will you die for me?
Preferably in your world, if you can.

268
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,119
Killing a king will be difficult.

269
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,164
It'll be easier to kill someone
without an identity.

270
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,958
It's so that you'll have a lot of mourners
at your funeral.

271
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:04,961
Call me when you leave.

272
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,801
-Your Majesty.
-What about Song Jeong-hye?

273
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,476
It's that house.

274
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,438
Lee Lim still hasn't shown up yet.

275
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,649
You must stand watch

276
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,027
and find out Lee Lim's route
to his bamboo forest.

277
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,278
I will.

278
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,658
And I got a call from Jo Eun-sup.

279
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,785
He said he met Lee Lim.

280
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,955
And Lee Lim mentioned

281
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,708
the memorial mass of the late queen.

282
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,798
Song Jeong-hye will go to church soon.
There's always someone watching her.

283
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,017
I think you've got the time wrong.

284
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,143
Let go of me.

285
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,772
If I scream right now,
things will get more complicated.

286
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,796
It must be you.

287
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,674
Lee Lim's nephew.

288
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,930
The same face as Ji-hun.

289
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,439
If Ji-hun were alive,

290
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,984
he'd have grown up like you.

291
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,367
But Ji-hun died

292
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,786
because of you.

293
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,084
And it seems like you'll die
because of me.

294
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,714
Lee Lim said that's why he kept me alive.

295
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,146
Detective Kang, it's me. I need your help.

296
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,024
Will you be okay?

297
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,535
It's my mother's death anniversary soon.

298
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,788
I believe Lee Lim

299
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,958
is planning on taking you there that day.

300
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,963
If you go to there,

301
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,717
you can't come back.

302
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,137
I'll help you.

303
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,389
Then will you come and save me?

304
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,350
Come two days before the anniversary.

305
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,936
I know the date, too.

306
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,486
-Your son--
-There's no point saying that.

307
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,823
The fact that he died because of you
won't change.

308
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,457
Don't die because of me.

309
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:13,960
I'm...

310
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,588
not your mother.

311
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,277
I'll come and escort you.

312
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,035
When will you leave?

313
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,527
Ms. Jeong Tae-eul's guardian? She's ready.

314
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,322
It's me. I'm her guardian.

315
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,832
Yeong, just for today.

316
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,253
Just until she can wash her face
on her own.

317
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,340
I should thank Luna.

318
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,094
I get to stay with you
because she stabbed me.

319
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,639
Don't say such a thing.

320
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,724
All right?

321
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,811
Don't you know how startled I was?

322
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,147
Put my hair back to how it was.

323
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,776
My hairstyle is what makes me look pretty.

324
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,407
Let me see.

325
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,266
What did you pray for?

326
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,187
It wasn't a prayer, but a threat.

327
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,773
I told him to stop being so harsh.

328
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,859
We didn't do anything that bad.

329
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,235
I asked

330
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,573
if we really have God's blessing.

331
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,800
I've never seen an adult
who couldn't do this.

332
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,803
Any messages for the owner?

333
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,474
Do I have to?

334
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,270
Thank you, I'll enjoy the food.

335
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,358
Enjoy your food.

336
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:25,985
What's this?

337
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,447
You said you wanted
convenience store food today.

338
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,033
Did you know you can get these delivered?

339
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,453
It was pretty easy to order this.

340
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,291
I saw you getting scolded by a little kid.

341
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,835
Wow, there's a lot of meat.

342
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,837
He was just explaining loudly.

343
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,132
Here.

344
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,720
What should I do?

345
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,558
I was told to get lots of rest,
so I can't pick up the spoon.

346
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,772
My goodness.

347
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,153
-Meat.
-Okay.

348
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,617
Is it good?

349
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,787
It's good.

350
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:22,917
This is nice.

351
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,336
Spending time like this.

352
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,964
Let's sneak out

353
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,049
after we eat.

354
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,677
Excuse me! Jeong Tae-eul is trying to--

355
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,931
-What are you doing?
-Here.

356
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,145
Eat up,
and don't think about sneaking out.

357
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,981
-Let's sneak out.
-Excuse me!

358
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,783
Yeong.

359
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,618
Just for today.

360
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,455
Let me just say goodbye.

361
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:45,792
Yes, Your Majesty.

362
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,710
I should, too.

363
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,685
Thanks for this.

364
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,854
I got it dry cleaned.

365
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,317
I said keep it. Why call me here?

366
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,074
Thank you for everything.

367
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,284
Take care.

368
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,869
You don't need to worry.

369
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,540
Live a long and healthy life
and don't get shot.

370
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,545
Well, people all meet and part
throughout their lives.

371
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,966
Goodbye. I won't see you off.

372
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,510
Hope you get a driver's license.

373
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,929
If you do,

374
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,890
what will your 65th dream be?

375
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,642
My dream?

376
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,645
Well,

377
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,899
I don't have anything like that anymore.

378
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,901
I think you do.

379
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,488
All right, then.

380
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,658
-Bye.
-Already? You're leaving now?

381
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,412
I do!

382
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,997
I do have a dream.

383
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,461
Seeing you again.

384
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,391
Let's

385
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,269
meet again someday.

386
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,320
You have to promise.

387
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,907
You have to come back someday.

388
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,507
You said this position
is actually really uncomfortable.

389
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,639
Do you think I even tried it before?
I didn't know what I was talking about.

390
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,684
Now that I've tried, it's really nice.

391
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,609
Let's...

392
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:23,241
do everything we skipped someday.

393
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,994
Let's travel together,

394
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,538
watch movies,

395
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,250
take photos together,

396
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,669
-and--
-Jeong Tae-eul.

397
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,129
Don't.

398
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,810
If you're trying to say you need to go,
don't.

399
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,023
I'm not letting you leave.

400
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,241
Let's just not save the world.

401
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,329
Let's just go back and forth

402
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,749
and only think about the present.

403
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,469
I know what you're planning to do.

404
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,889
You're going to go to the past.

405
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,185
You're going to try
and catch Lee Lim before he comes here.

406
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,615
Then I won't…

407
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,412
be able to remember you.

408
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,502
If our worlds flow differently
from the present,

409
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,802
then I'll live without knowing you.

410
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,935
Our worlds

411
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,399
have already gone so wrong.

412
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,827
But Ji-hun died

413
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,330
because of you.

414
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,458
There are so many reasons

415
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,129
to change the past.

416
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,590
And that

417
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,469
is the only way.

418
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,849
So

419
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,229
tell me to go.

420
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,565
Tell me to leave.

421
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,693
Please.

422
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,077
I'm asking for someone's permission

423
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,373
for the first time in my life.

424
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,426
If you stop me,

425
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,055
I can't leave.

426
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,031
Tell me you'll come back.

427
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,327
That's the tenth rule.

428
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,835
No matter what happens,
you have to come back.

429
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,214
That's the 11th rule.

430
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,761
Catch Lee Lim,

431
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,223
and even if the door closes,

432
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,728
open all the doors in the universe

433
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,107
and return to me. Promise me.

434
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,611
That's the 12th rule.

435
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,619
I will.

436
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,541
I'll open all the doors in the universe.

437
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,591
And I promise

438
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,387
I will return to you.

439
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,703
If you ask someone
to meet at a place like this,

440
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,122
you should be waiting here first.

441
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:26,752
I was worried you'd be feeling dejected,
but I guess there was no need.

442
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:33,050
You can't become queen,
and you've been suspended.

443
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,345
You can't even get
near a high position now.

444
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:41,433
So I'm thinking of going to a vast place
instead of a high place.

445
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,565
Yours seems to be that umbrella.

446
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,566
What about

447
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,402
Lee Gon's?

448
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,697
I want to take it.

449
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,491
Wouldn't it be nice?

450
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,411
We can each have one.

451
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,037
There is a better way.

452
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,541
You can have this as well.

453
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,752
What are you trying to--

454
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,925
I'm expressing my anger at you.

455
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,804
What I wanted from you was simple.

456
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,433
Get Lee Gon or get the Kingdom of Corea.

457
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,228
But you've lost both.

458
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,065
There is only one way for you to live now.

459
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,485
Find a way for me to attend
the memorial mass

460
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,488
for Lee Gon's mother
that will be held soon.

461
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,074
You, me,

462
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,411
and the late queen
who will be raised from the dead.

463
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,665
I am going to announce at the mass
that there are two worlds,

464
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,127
the Kingdom of Corea
and the Republic of Korea.

465
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:09,063
I guess my nephew has finally turned up.

466
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,650
RELICS EXHIBITION
KINGDOM OF COREA

467
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,180
Where did he go?

468
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,354
What is this?

469
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,244
Your Majesty, what...

470
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,789
My goodness. What happened?

471
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:13,752
Your Majesty.

472
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,964
Thank you

473
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,592
for letting me go back then.

474
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,469
I know.

475
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,472
I know, Your Majesty.

476
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,901
What about Uncle's funeral rite?

477
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,238
I'm sure people would've talked
about my absence.

478
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:46,410
We announced that it was done privately
and that you were grieving alone.

479
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,121
The bereaved all left the country

480
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,790
and Lee Seung-heon
is leaving in four hours.

481
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,467
Does he limp by any chance?

482
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,719
Yes, he does.

483
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,184
Please check his current location.

484
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,478
I will see him off myself.

485
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,330
Those crazy jerks!

486
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:35,918
Damn it!

487
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,009
Your Majesty?

488
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:48,388
We finished the funeral rite
and did everything to embarrass ourselves.

489
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,642
What are you doing here
when it's all over?

490
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,771
Don't you remember me?
From the night of the treason,

491
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,315
back gate of the palace.

492
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,202
The man who shot your leg.

493
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,334
What...

494
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,295
How do you have this?

495
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,589
The best thing you did your whole life

496
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,801
is that you hid it well from my uncle.

497
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,303
If he had known
that you were an accomplice,

498
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,181
he would've killed himself.

499
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,019
You will never be able to return
to this kingdom, even after your death.

500
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:36,937
Wait.

501
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,524
-Please hear me out.
-Prince Buyeong's son Lee Seung-heon

502
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,151
is to be exiled
from the Kingdom permanently.

503
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,319
Yes, Your Majesty.

504
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,824
Your Majesty, wait!

505
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:50,909
Gon!

506
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:52,953
Your Majesty!

507
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,372
Gon!

508
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,961
Please change into this.
It's the king's order.

509
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,036
Is it really you, Hyeon-min?

510
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,416
It's me, your mom. Can you recognize me?

511
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,674
It was the only thing

512
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,719
I could do back then.

513
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,350
I'm sorry. I really am.

514
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,440
Did you lose me

515
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,609
or abandon me?

516
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:12,115
Did you lose me
by accident or did you let go of my hand?

517
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,411
I wanted you to live

518
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,539
a decent life.

519
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,170
I didn't get to…

520
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,299
live a decent life.

521
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,062
Don't get your hopes up.

522
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,483
And don't ask me for forgiveness.

523
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,696
I just wanted

524
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,199
to see you once.

525
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,286
I want to wake up

526
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,915
from a bad dream.

527
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,712
Stay healthy.

528
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,173
This time,

529
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,343
I'm the one abandoning you.

530
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:47,002
I thought kings had grander meals
than this.

531
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,921
It depends on who I'm eating with.

532
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,258
They set the table to suit you.

533
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,304
You have more drinks, right?

534
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,440
Thank you for today. 

535
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,611
Your mother won't be harmed.

536
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,492
Now I've paid you back for the meal.

537
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,704
Thanks for that, too.

538
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,998
Where will you go now?

539
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,667
Are you going to stay?

540
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,712
Or will you go back?

541
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:36,134
What about you?
Are you really going back to that night?

542
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,221
-I should.
-If you do,

543
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,931
are you sure you can catch Lee Lim?

544
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,809
It's possible if I only target Lee Lim.

545
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,144
The moment he chokes me.

546
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,943
He'll be defenseless then
since he'll be focused on his anger.

547
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,488
Why didn't you do it before?

548
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,660
You'll regret asking me if I told you.

549
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,874
I broke the dome glass

550
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,920
and set off the alarm
to grab everyone's attention

551
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,799
because I wanted to save the young me.

552
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,845
So you won't save yourself this time?

553
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,432
-Then you'll disappear.
-If I succeed,

554
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,728
all your time
in the Republic of Korea will disappear.

555
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,066
I'll be returning things
to before Kang Hyeon-min met Lee Lim.

556
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,864
So you have to make a choice
you won't regret.

557
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,699
I'm saying

558
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,452
that this is your last chance to kill me.

559
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,174
I should've poisoned your drink.

560
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,472
Does Tae-eul know your plan too?

561
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,353
She shouldn't.

562
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,529
You let your guard down.

563
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,659
Ms. Baek!

564
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,373
You bitch.

565
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,960
How dare you!

566
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,175
You fool.

567
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,386
Did you pray?

568
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,143
I prayed every day for God to kill me.

569
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:14,978
And finally--

570
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,402
I'm going to die.

571
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:28,074
I'm finally going to die.

572
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,340
I even transcended death,

573
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,928
but how is it
that I'm unable to avoid you?

574
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,432
How did you find me here?

575
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,475
It'd be easy if it were just me.

576
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,018
But

577
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,146
I'm not alone.

578
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,190
Someone sets the time,

579
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,900
someone chases after you,

580
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,903
someone prays for you to get caught,

581
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:30,822
and someone

582
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,075
is going to fight you.

583
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:42,167
How dare you try
to attend my mother's memorial mass?

584
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:46,796
You should've waited for me there.
We should've met there.

585
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,591
This can't happen.

586
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,719
I can't let things end like this.

587
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,557
Time won't flow again

588
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,018
for a while.

589
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,151
At first, it was only 22 steps.

590
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,236
You've stopped the world

591
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,281
that I am supposed to have.

592
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,325
You postponed death

593
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,994
for 25 years by using the Manpasikjeok,

594
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,829
so now the world is dying.

595
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,417
That is why this fight must end now.

596
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,983
This can't be.

597
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,618
Is something wrong?

598
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,353
You can't open my door.
I'm sure you expected that.

599
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,482
The Manpasikjeok was soaked with my blood.

600
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,633
You two wait here.

601
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,830
They're the obelisks of my father.

602
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,251
I've finally witnessed it
with my own eyes.

603
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:17,340
The moment I've been waiting for
has finally arrived.

604
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,554
I cannot hear the flute.

605
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,266
The Manpasikjeok isn't crying.

606
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,937
You have eternity and infinity
in your hands now. Don't be absurd.

607
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,649
Of course, it's not crying.
It's whole again at last.

608
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,443
Forget about the treason.

609
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,863
We should go inside. Just the two of us.

610
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,908
It's not crying.

611
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,829
If it doesn't cry, I can't go back
to the night of the treason.

612
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,081
I must

613
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,459
make the crack again.

614
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,462
You have to give him back his piece?

615
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,800
I don't need it anymore.
It's finally whole again.

616
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,637
Eternity and infinity
are waiting for us in there,

617
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:09,183
and you're just going to use that
to go back to that night?

618
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,018
I don't need eternity and infinity.

619
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,187
You will

620
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,481
never see

621
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,775
nor own that place.

622
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,695
You fool.

623
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,699
Fine. Try it, then.

624
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,619
You can ask or order me to go and die.

625
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,372
You can open your own door,

626
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,667
but you'd need someone
to escort me past my door.

627
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:35,877
Who would it be?

628
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,172
Who will you order to die in there?

629
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,089
Shut up.

630
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,384
You have not transcended death.

631
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,054
You've postponed God's punishment.

632
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,224
With your taunting added,

633
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,520
I'll make sure you die a miserable death.

634
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,356
I'll stay and go with him.

635
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,610
No, I'll go.
I just have to go with this jerk?

636
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,696
I'll get rid of the traitor
with my own hands.

637
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,325
I told you many times.
Get lost and go to your own world.

638
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,161
Give me the piece. When should I go?

639
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,446
How far do you want me to go?

640
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,659
How far?

641
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,788
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

642
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,876
-Did you get discharged?
-What happened?

643
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,004
How did you catch Lee Lim?

644
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,424
I tracked down Song Jeong-hye.

645
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:10,596
And she's dead.
I just confirmed she has no family.

646
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:15,059
We should've been there for her.

647
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,063
We need to question him. Come inside.

648
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:32,618
LATE SONG JEONG-HYE

649
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:21,751
Secretary Mo.

650
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:23,836
Please announce

651
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:27,882
Se-jin as first in line to the throne
tomorrow morning.

652
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,053
-Your Majesty.
-If anything happens to me,

653
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,680
Prince Buyeong's granddaughter Se-jin

654
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,602
will succeed to the throne.

655
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:41,896
Your Majesty.

656
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,185
Where is the Manpasikjeok? No,

657
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,313
who has it right now?

658
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,607
Did you come here to die too?

659
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:12,528
-You're going to go and die?
-Just answer my question.

660
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,239
Where's the Manpasikjeok?

661
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,324
You should be scared!

662
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:21,245
Why are you idiots making such choices?
Why?

663
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:22,997
I am scared

664
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,750
that he'll be lonely by himself.

665
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,127
I'm scared

666
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,047
that our worlds will continue on.

667
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,299
So make a choice, too.

668
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,510
Wouldn't it be better
if you go in with me?

669
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,930
This is your last chance.

670
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,392
Who has the Manpasikjeok?

671
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,145
If that's what you're afraid of,

672
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,274
I must have not taught you anything.

673
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:55,988
I've sent hell to my nephew
and Prime Minister Koo.

674
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,452
Prince Buyeong's granddaughter
Lee Se-jin, who was residing in LA,

675
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:04,038
died this morning in a car accident.

676
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,748
Park Ji-yeong, the granddaughter

677
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,125
of Hogyeong Pharmaceutical's founder,
was at fault.

678
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:11,378
The fact that she was pregnant
and due soon has caused even more shock.

679
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:16,050
Ms. Park was in LA to meet with friends
before her due date...

680
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:19,136
He used Ji-yeong to do that?

681
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,809
The White House has stated...

682
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,528
Mom?

683
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,072
Mom.

684
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:41,992
Mom, what did you

685
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,912
eat for dinner today?

686
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,498
Dinner?

687
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,042
Didn't you eat dinner yet?

688
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:51,961
Are you busy?

689
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,547
Mom, come on. Answer me.

690
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,677
What did you have for dinner?

691
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,596
I ordered jajangmyeon.

692
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,559
Why? Is there something you want to eat?

693
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,251
What's going on?

694
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,964
Are you letting me go too
since I'm going to die?

695
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,677
I still have a bit more time.

696
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,346
Don't live just a bit. Live a long life.

697
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,224
Or else my dad will be upset.

698
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,310
Just get to the point.

699
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,480
I'm going to go somewhere.
It might take a long time.

700
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,985
Protect my dad while I'm gone
as Jeong Tae-eul.

701
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,739
And steal something for me before that.

702
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,299
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

703
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:23,052
They put me back in one piece.

704
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:24,678
Hey!

705
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,397
What happened?

706
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:38,192
The door looks fine. How did she run away?

707
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,489
I let her go a while ago.

708
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,200
Why?

709
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,203
You have the Manpasikjeok, right?

710
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:51,664
Give it to me.

711
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,085
I don't. What is that?

712
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,379
I have Lee Lim.

713
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,675
Why would you have brought him
to the station?

714
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:06,971
We can't punish him under our law anyway.

715
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,766
It's because you need to keep him safe
for 48 hours.

716
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,059
You must have promised

717
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:14,311
to bring Lee Lim

718
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,690
to the bamboo forest in 48 hours.

719
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,988
Give me the Manpasikjeok.
I have to go there.

720
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:24,905
I won't let you.

721
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:26,615
You can't.

722
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:31,829
If you go, you might not come back.
Why would you go?

723
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:34,748
I don't think

724
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,295
I can remain here and endure it alone.

725
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,548
Don't make me do that.

726
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,093
Please.

727
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:48,345
Give it to me.

728
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,056
Don't you get it?

729
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,393
I'm not letting you go.

730
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,491
I wanted to keep this secret to the grave,

731
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,245
but I have no choice
but to tell you the truth.

732
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:22,046
I have feelings for you, Tae-eul.

733
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,675
I've had feelings for you and you alone
my whole life.

734
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,929
For every second until now,

735
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,266
I've liked you.

736
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,437
So how can I let you go?

737
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,316
How can I just let you die?

738
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,903
Don't be ridiculous and go home.

739
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:55,913
Please...

740
01:12:58,749 --> 01:12:59,833
Give it to me.

741
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,339
I won't apologize

742
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,759
for not having known how you felt.

743
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,846
If I say I feel bad for you now,

744
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,224
I'd be a hypocrite.

745
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,311
But

746
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,315
just like your feelings for me,

747
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,028
I also like someone a lot.

748
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:35,911
I promise I'll come back and make up
for all the times I upset you.

749
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,041
So just give it to me.

750
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,337
Please, help me.

751
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:48,424
If I don't go,

752
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,971
I think I'll really die, Sin-jae.

753
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,270
God must have known

754
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,440
that I'd choose to kill Lee Lim

755
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,651
instead of saving myself.

756
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,243
Are you going somewhere special,
Your Majesty?

757
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:01,622
You're wearing your ceremonial outfit.

758
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:25,229
That is why God had left the mark
on my shoulder.

759
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,732
It was so I'd follow my destiny.

760
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,860
How selfish.

761
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,453
-Your Majesty.
-I'm telling you first

762
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,039
so you won't be anxious.

763
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:46,959
Tell me what?

764
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:52,005
You

765
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:54,925
must've been so lonely.

766
01:15:57,177 --> 01:15:58,262
You kept my secret

767
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,390
and yours all to yourself.

768
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:06,436
That book of poems

769
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,482
was a gift for you.

770
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:13,610
The lullaby

771
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:18,073
you used to sing to me

772
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,617
was in that book.

773
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,957
The thought had crossed my mind,

774
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,793
and it made me anxious.

775
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:36,216
But why didn't you ask me about it?

776
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,428
I thought you'd try to go back

777
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,639
to your world.

778
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,394
-Your Majesty...
-But thanks to you,

779
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,856
I was able to read a beautiful poem.

780
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,985
And I have a favor to ask you.

781
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,448
Please let me go

782
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:02,993
once again.

783
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,379
If I let you go,

784
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:20,636
will you ever come back?

785
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:22,721
You

786
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,559
have to stay healthy.

787
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,772
This is my last order.

788
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,984
Your Majesty...

789
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,360
Where are you going this time?

790
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,697
-Yeong.
-Don't even think about it.

791
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:25,826
Wherever you go, you can't go alone.

792
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,703
I will go with you,

793
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,372
no matter where it is,

794
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,041
whichever battlefield it is.

795
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:37,170
Even more so if it's somewhere
you can't return from.

796
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:56,231
