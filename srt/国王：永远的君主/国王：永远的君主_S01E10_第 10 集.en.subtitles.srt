00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,980
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,982
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,860
EPISODE 10

4
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,032
Was it a really long dream?

5
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,411
It was my first time
seeing a house like that.

6
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,290
A house with a gate and a sofa.

7
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,379
And my mom smelled really nice.

8
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,507
"I really hope Kang Hyeon-min

9
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,468
is just a dream."

10
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,220
I thought to myself.

11
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,430
It could really be just a dream.

12
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,810
Why do you think
that Kang Hyeon-min is a memory?

13
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,520
I met someone.

14
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,898
Someone from that world.

15
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,820
Did they say
that they're from a different world?

16
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,323
-Do you think I'm delusional?
-Well, the symptoms...

17
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,702
Enough about the nightmare.

18
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,663
Tell me about the beautiful dream
that you've been having.

19
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,792
This is where you go for your vacation?

20
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,800
What about you? It's not your day off.

21
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,427
Why don't you answer my calls?

22
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,346
Do you know how many days
I staked out here?

23
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,143
Good for you.
You have too much time to kill.

24
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,562
The bill, please.

25
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,731
You asked me

26
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,025
how far I've gone.

27
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,986
It's science fiction.

28
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,238
Do you want me to tell you?

29
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,616
Later. I'm still on my vacation.

30
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,201
Hey.

31
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,539
Lee Sang-do is alive.

32
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,502
Lee Sang-do and Jang Yeon-ji
have something in common.

33
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,297
They both were said

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,175
to have had two cell phones.

35
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,052
Do you know why?

36
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,474
There's another world where people
with the same faces as ours live.

37
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,559
I've been there.

38
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,730
A crime already took place
across both worlds,

39
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,899
but I can't report it.

40
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,442
How can I prove it?

41
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,320
Someone has to stop this,

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,532
but you're the only one I can think of.

43
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,118
Help me.

44
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,667
That's not science fiction.
I call that a delusion.

45
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,878
What "another world"?
Get a hold of yourself, you fool.

46
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,485
This...

47
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,697
makes no sense.

48
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,032
No way.

49
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,869
He's delaying time inside that place.

50
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,164
Ten days to the last day of the year.

51
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,500
I have about five hours.

52
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,255
And another thing I missed
is the only place where I can find

53
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,841
Lee Lim's obelisks.

54
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,397
When the sun goes down
over the white rapids,

55
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:20,278
I shall wait by the gate.

56
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:28,286
Between the shadows
of the birds singing at dawn,

57
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,122
I see the world brightening up

58
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,125
in its still calmness.

59
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,841
With my eyes fixated
on the traveler passing by

60
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,345
at the break of dawn,

61
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,266
"Is that you?"

62
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,686
"Is that you?"

63
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,690
Hey.

64
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,864
What?

65
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,327
You're finally here.
Did you just get here?

66
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,734
Have you been waiting here?

67
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,406
Are you really here?

68
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,452
Not yet. Not entirely.

69
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,915
I missed you so much

70
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,543
like crazy,

71
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,381
so I was going to just hear your voice
and leave.

72
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,217
My voice?

73
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,723
I was going to call you
from that pay phone over there.

74
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,220
You really need to tell me now.

75
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,430
Where is His Majesty?

76
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,683
It's the New Year ceremony.

77
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,270
You need to at least help me
come up with an excuse for his absence.

78
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,982
Don't worry.
Just plan for it as we normally do.

79
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,693
He'll return before Lunar New Year.

80
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,906
But Lunar New Year
is the day after tomorrow.

81
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,285
I'm on my way to an early grave
from worry.

82
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,209
Your Majesty.

83
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,092
What's the date today? Am I back on time?

84
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,387
Lunar New Year should be in a day or two.

85
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,222
It's the 23rd.

86
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,016
You came just in time.

87
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:21,894
Thank God.

88
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,064
I lost count.

89
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,734
What on earth is happening?

90
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,488
Did you have a secret rendezvous or...

91
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,200
Something amazing like that?

92
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:41,038
It's more like illegal immigration,
but it was quite amazing.

93
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,665
See you tomorrow.

94
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,591
Here's the hotel room key.

95
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,384
Thank you.

96
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,389
We never even had a chance
to grab a bite together. Eat up.

97
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,226
I'll have to leave
as soon as I finish this.

98
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,563
This guy's family is coming.

99
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,941
It's Lunar New Year already.

100
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,569
I feel bad you're not home
for the holiday.

101
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,114
I know,
but Eun-sup is in the same situation.

102
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,079
Just make sure you don't get
on Eun-bi's nerves. You can't beat her.

103
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,292
Don't worry about that.
I'm worried that she's too fond of me.

104
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,836
I gotta go.

105
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,381
Happy New Year.

106
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,551
You too.

107
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,241
What are you doing?

108
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,035
Stand straight.

109
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,206
Your uncle is waiting.

110
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,833
You put this on by yourself every year.

111
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,751
Every year?

112
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,254
This? These multicolored stripes?

113
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,674
What? Jeez.

114
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,475
Mom.

115
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,601
Yes, what?

116
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,396
I've been watching him carefully.

117
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,272
You see, that man...

118
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,693
isn't Eun-sup.

119
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,154
What do you mean?

120
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,990
Daddy is waiting in the car.

121
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,370
If you look carefully, he's changed
for the better but worse in some ways.

122
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,663
What?

123
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,208
He's much cooler now,

124
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,461
but he's also become a prick!

125
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,216
Eun-sup. What is this?

126
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,427
Hey, don't touch that.

127
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,438
It's a souvenir from the military.

128
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,358
See? Let's call the police now.

129
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,861
The entire Jo family is at stake.

130
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,573
He is my son.

131
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,454
I gave birth to this cool guy here
for the Jo family.

132
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,377
You've been discharged. Grow up.

133
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,088
Why are you playing with kids' toys?

134
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,008
Get ready, okay?

135
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,358
The Republic of Korea.

136
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,070
How is a mere seven-year-old here
as sharp as the Royal Guards?

137
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,074
I mean,

138
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,745
who works the night shift
on New Year's Day?

139
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,875
This happened
because our squad has no power.

140
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,254
Somebody had to do this,
so let's just be glad we got the job done.

141
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,464
I like it.

142
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,051
The sunrise, the coffee,
and the first night duty of the new year.

143
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,386
A true violent crimes unit.

144
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,305
Hey, tell me.

145
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,643
What do those three things
have to do with the violent crimes unit?

146
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,733
Everyone is looking at us.

147
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,196
They're like, "Who's working
the night shift on New Year's Day.

148
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,989
Oh. It's them."

149
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,241
-Exactly.
-Poor us.

150
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,953
No, they think
we're filming a TV commercial.

151
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,580
This totally looks like a scene
from a TV commercial.

152
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,256
Did you spike his tteokguk?

153
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,926
Guys, you all did a great job last year.

154
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,845
-Let's keep it up--
-That old geezer.

155
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,138
-Stop it, or I'll get mad.
-I like it.

156
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,683
The sunrise, the coffee,
new year pleasantries.

157
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,769
-Let's just ignore them.
-I'm done. I give up.

158
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:19,608
Hey, could that cool guy
walking toward us be Sin-jae?

159
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,702
I'm back.

160
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,203
Welcome back.

161
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,664
I'm glad you got some well-deserved rest.

162
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,374
Let's get back to work.

163
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,417
-Gosh.
-Yes, sir!

164
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,627
-Let's get some work done.
-Gosh, my legs.

165
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,802
What was that about the cell phone?
I'm all ears.

166
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,268
Year 2020 has begun.

167
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,064
Another incredible year
has been added to our lives.

168
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,486
I've been thinking about the plus sign,
a mathematical symbol.

169
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,865
It's found in hospital signs, equations,

170
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,034
and it's also a cross.

171
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,037
Depending on the meaning
that's added to it,

172
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
it can have meanings of healing to some
and prayer to others.

173
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,501
And for some people,

174
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,297
it gives them courage to face their fate.

175
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,967
Year 2020

176
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,013
is the year of the mighty white rat.

177
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,933
The rat is the first creature
in the zodiac,

178
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,728
and it's also the god of direction
and time.

179
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,482
I'll be rooting

180
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,446
for your every step
and every second of the year 2020.

181
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,993
Happy New Year to you all.

182
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,748
Wow!

183
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,960
My gosh, he's so charismatic
when he's giving a speech.

184
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,463
I'm at your service! I'm...

185
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,637
What's His Majesty's type?

186
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,141
What's with this blunt question?

187
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,478
You seemed busy.

188
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,189
You seem busier, Prime Minister Koo.

189
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,566
You only have a year until your term ends.

190
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,820
A year is more than enough.

191
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,073
Don't you know I was married
and divorced in just a year?

192
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,120
With your help,
just half a year would be enough.

193
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,872
Give me some tips.

194
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,168
What can crush His Majesty's heart.

195
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,589
The normal question would be,
"What makes his heart flutter?"

196
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,259
Yet you are asking
what can crush his heart.

197
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,471
Talk about a violent love.

198
00:16:55,764 --> 00:17:00,853
Has His Majesty ever shed tears
in front of you?

199
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,646
Even just once?

200
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,361
That is why I refuse to help you.

201
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,865
That was an excellent speech.

202
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,786
Will you also be rooting for me
every step of the way?

203
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,081
As I said before, I always have.

204
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,460
I hope you don't have
a bad sense of direction.

205
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,469
Your Majesty,

206
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,220
someone's calling.

207
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,138
DETECTIVE KANG

208
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,389
Then answer it.

209
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,893
Lower your voice and say,
"Jo Yeong speaking."

210
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,566
I love hearing it.

211
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,570
Yeong looks very cool
when he answers the phone in such a voice.

212
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,116
Jo Yeong speaking.

213
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,041
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

214
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,252
Who is Detective Kang Jun-hyeok?

215
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,963
It's... It's me, Your Majesty!

216
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,590
I am Kang Jun-hyeok.

217
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,106
You're...

218
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,150
still alive.

219
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm borrowing your name.

220
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,782
It's even on the documents now.

221
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,243
I'm paying you for the name.

222
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,622
Don't let anyone chase you

223
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,707
and trust no one.

224
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,210
I hope

225
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,171
you live a long life,

226
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,298
Luna.

227
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,592
This girl is Luna.

228
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,970
She was locked up until two weeks ago,

229
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,764
but it seems she's been released.

230
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,974
On what grounds?

231
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,811
She didn't complete her sentence.
She got out early.

232
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,730
Apparently, she's terminally ill.

233
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,275
Do you need her diagnosis?

234
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,365
I'd like to meet her in person,
if that is possible at all.

235
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,284
Sure, we will find her.

236
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,537
You should report everything
about this case to me directly.

237
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,997
One more thing.

238
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,293
I need information on this person.

239
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,795
KIM GI-HWAN
BORN NOVEMBER 23, 1968

240
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,467
PERSONAL INFORMATION
KIM GI-HWAN

241
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,345
If he's dead

242
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,931
in this world...

243
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,518
Yes, Your Majesty.
He was one of the traitor's followers,

244
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,272
but he died while on the run.
He took his own life.

245
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,692
Those with the same faces

246
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,612
are stealing the lives

247
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,239
of their counterparts.

248
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,117
EVIDENCE
0631 SPECIAL LARCENY

249
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:17,132
DO EXACTLY AS YOU BELIEVE

250
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,177
-It's snowing.
-My gosh!

251
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,221
It's snowing!

252
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,469
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

253
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,472
Happy New Year.

254
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,526
Lee Lim...

255
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,738
has finally returned
to the Kingdom of Corea.

256
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:27,911
Your Majesty.

257
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,790
Did you see anyone pass by just now?

258
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,500
-No, I didn't.
-No one, so far?

259
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,296
Correct. We've been on rotating shifts
for 17 days but haven't seen anyone.

260
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,550
What is it that I'm missing here?

261
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,055
Had guarding this bamboo forest
been enough, we would've already met.

262
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,642
He, too, would've had guards
on the other side.

263
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,812
Our gateways

264
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,523
are different.

265
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,775
This was a waste of time.

266
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,361
Your Majesty, with all due respect--

267
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,698
Is there a shortcut to Haeundae
that doesn't pass through the palace?

268
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,367
The path under Point Seven
is no longer in use--

269
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,285
That's plan B.

270
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,662
All Royal Guards to Haeundae now.

271
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,164
Pull out of here at once.

272
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,165
Yes, Your Majesty!

273
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,462
Yes.

274
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,672
Yes, it's ready.

275
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,009
We just need to post it
on our social media pages.

276
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:26,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

277
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,473
-Is the event notice going up?
-Yes.

278
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,682
What's going on?

279
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,810
His Majesty planned an event
to visit Haeundae?

280
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,563
His Majesty needed to invite someone.

281
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,107
Right, exactly. What does that mean?

282
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,319
My gosh, His Majesty is coming
to Haeundae!

283
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,534
NEW YEAR'S MOONLIGHT WALK WITH THE KING

284
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,503
Traitor...

285
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,132
Lee Lim!

286
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,439
Do you remember my voice?

287
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,443
I remember yours.

288
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,071
Yes, my dear nephew. It's me.

289
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,574
How have you been?

290
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,869
You are...

291
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,457
actually alive.

292
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,709
Yes.

293
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,129
And I have been waiting for this day,
my dear nephew.

294
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,717
Since missing the opportunity
I'd waited for my whole life,

295
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,137
I've waited while living a different life.

296
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,768
Wait just a little longer.

297
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,896
I will

298
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,399
find you at all costs.

299
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,904
This is the first time
you're talking like a king.

300
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,907
Please do find me.

301
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,910
You told the world that I died.

302
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,456
So now, bring this dead man back to life.

303
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,252
I am looking forward to

304
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,381
the chaos it will cause.

305
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,467
He is one of the traitor's followers.
Get him!

306
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,195
Hold your fire.

307
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,618
Hold your fire!

308
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,953
The safety of the people is first!

309
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,498
Captain!

310
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,534
Inform the police
and transport the injured first.

311
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,078
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,206
Everyone except for a few
that you can spare,

313
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,416
protect the people
until the police arrive.

314
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,793
Then those bastards--

315
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,670
No, we won't chase them.

316
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,672
There must be no more casualties.

317
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:59,427
Collect CCTV footage from all the cameras
within a one-kilometer radius immediately.

318
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,513
If any videos get posted,

319
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,266
they must be taken down at all costs.

320
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,893
Yes, Your Majesty!

321
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,526
Eun-sup.

322
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,404
Wake up.

323
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,948
Jo Eun-sup.

324
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,535
A shoot-out?

325
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,497
Yes. His Majesty is okay,
but Captain Jo got hurt.

326
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,417
That is not what I'm asking.

327
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,337
What's this trending keyword about?
"Traitor Lee Lim." Is this true?

328
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,717
Well, the stories of his sighting
are coming up, but there's no proof.

329
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,094
Most believe that it's just a conspiracy.

330
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,723
He looked just like Lee Lim
when he was alive.

331
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,767
What's going on?

332
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,229
What on earth is happening?

333
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,609
Secure any photos or videos of the scene
as soon as possible and call the palace.

334
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,527
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,450
Is His Majesty

336
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,327
an honest person?

337
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,217
What? Lee Lim?

338
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,762
-The traitor Lee Lim?
-What's going on?

339
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,097
My gosh! Look what happened in Busan.

340
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,683
What? A shoot-out?

341
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,477
What's this?

342
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,188
-Lee Lim is alive?
-What is going on?

343
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,690
-So he's actually alive?
-I guess so.

344
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,570
Your Highness, the security level
for you has been elevated to level one.

345
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,864
What is going on? A shoot-out?

346
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,033
What are they talking about?

347
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,663
Thanks to his bulletproof vest,
there's no fractures or organ damage,

348
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,249
but I see torn muscles and ligaments,

349
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,170
so we'll keep him here for about two weeks
and see how he recovers.

350
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,088
What about the other two?

351
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,508
We've sealed their wounds.

352
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,637
Are you really okay, Your Majesty?

353
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,641
Head Court Lady Noh keeps calling us
every five minutes.

354
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,060
Yes, I'm fine.

355
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,523
Please just take good care of them.

356
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,610
Of course, please don't worry.
I will take my leave.

357
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,167
You're crying.

358
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:43,550
Why don't you taste that canned peach
for me if you're that worried?

359
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,593
Are you really okay?

360
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,762
That was a real gun.

361
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,307
-You could've died.
-What was I supposed to do?

362
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,520
Yeong told me to protect Your Majesty
at all costs.

363
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,107
He said he'll do the same for my siblings.

364
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,320
Well, you now agree

365
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,825
that I deserve the title
of the Unbreakable Sword, right?

366
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,495
Yes, most definitely.

367
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,417
Thank you for protecting me.

368
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:43,526
NOTICE
DO NOT ENTER

369
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,706
Are you all right?

370
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,500
The country's in chaos.

371
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,544
The police and Royal Guards
will chase you.

372
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,462
After whom?

373
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,214
A 70-year-old man?

374
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,174
Or a man

375
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,927
who was shot to death 25 years ago?

376
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:17,268
Today, my dear nephew must've realized
the weight of his own words

377
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:22,106
down to the bone.

378
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,152
Still, you should be careful.
Prince Buyeong visited the store.

379
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,281
Did he recognize you?

380
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,493
No, I don't think so.
I think it was a coincidence.

381
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,878
Most things that seem like coincidences
are actually meant to be,

382
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,548
and anything that was meant to be
is called destiny.

383
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,510
But don't worry.

384
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,804
Goodwill is always useless,

385
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,015
and its destiny is powerless.

386
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,648
I am looking forward to the next time
he and I will cross paths.

387
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,201
28 19GA-GIL DONGIL-RO JUNGNANG-GU

388
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,623
Who? Who did you see? Ji-hun's mom?

389
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,501
The woman who used to work
as our housekeeper?

390
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,504
Yes, her. I didn't recognize her at first.

391
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,464
She looked like a different person.

392
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,092
They say you never know
what can happen in life.

393
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,094
Things must've worked out. Good for her.

394
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,305
Come on.
I bet she just snatched a rich, old man.

395
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,351
It could be a rich, young guy.
You never know.

396
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,147
Her kid was the same age as Sin-jae,

397
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,483
so I gave her
a ton of Sin-jae's old clothes.

398
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,152
That was so long ago.

399
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,487
Oh, right. How's your back?

400
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,770
-You weren't coming alone?
-I thought you were both gone.

401
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,856
We came together,
and they didn't leave together.

402
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:31,194
This science fiction story needs you both.
So no objections. Both of you.

403
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,653
Okay?

404
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,167
Lee Sang-do has gone over
to the Kingdom from the Republic of Korea.

405
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,630
And it looks like Jang Yeon-ji
is getting ready to go to the Kingdom.

406
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,677
Kim Gi-hwan came to Korea
from the Kingdom but has been sent back.

407
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,432
They all have 2G phones.
We haven't found Jang Yeon-ji's yet.

408
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,643
We should go to the penitentiary first.

409
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,604
So you took him back to the Kingdom?

410
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,648
That's where he belongs.

411
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,692
That's not for you to decide.

412
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,945
If he's reported missing,
it'll be a headache.

413
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,988
Could we deal with him with the law here?

414
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,825
You took him to bring him to justice?
What did he do?

415
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,826
Illegal stay?

416
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,370
Doesn't the law of my country
also apply to you?

417
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,707
What are you talking about?

418
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,459
When do we visit Jang Yeon-ji?

419
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,337
Would you like some drink, Detective Kang?

420
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,257
-I'll have some coffee.
-Black? Or a latte?

421
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,302
Is there something
that I don't know about?

422
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,107
Are you hurt?

423
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,485
Is Captain Jo okay?

424
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,863
We are fine.

425
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,123
By the way, is it true?

426
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,334
Did you really see Traitor Lee Lim?

427
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,253
I chased him.

428
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,422
I chased after him

429
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,259
-but I let him get away.
-Why?

430
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,178
He looked exactly the same as he did

431
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,138
25 years ago.

432
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,143
-He hasn't aged at all.
-What? He hasn't aged?

433
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,438
See? I can't even convince you.

434
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,107
I can't even explain.

435
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,359
That's what he's after.

436
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,906
Returning to this world
as a man who doesn't age.

437
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,658
That's why I let him go.

438
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,494
So please

439
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,748
pray that I will win this fight.

440
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,417
I'll win no matter what.

441
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,294
Your Majesty.

442
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,802
Your Majesty,
Prime Minister Koo is on the phone.

443
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,640
Here's His Majesty.

444
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,894
Hello.

445
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,021
I'm fine.

446
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,899
If you called to check up on me,
let's talk later.

447
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,859
I already heard that you're okay.

448
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,696
I'm truly relieved.
But you must be distraught,

449
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,989
so I'll keep this short.

450
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,324
What is it?

451
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,994
Conspiracy theory
about Lee Lim has been spreading.

452
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,665
Hence, I'd like to ask you a question
out of genuine concern.

453
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,667
I trust that you'll be honest.

454
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,795
Was it Lee Lim?

455
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,506
Or his followers?

456
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,347
Prime Minister Koo, have you started
your horseback-riding lessons yet?

457
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,599
I beg your pardon?

458
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,478
The gag should act as a mediator
between the horse and the rider.

459
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,605
No one should pull the gag

460
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,566
to change the horse's direction.

461
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,195
What happened today was not just

462
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,197
about the Royal Court or me, the king.

463
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,865
It was a terrorism.

464
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,451
As recorded in history,

465
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,871
Lee Lim was shot to death
a year after the coup.

466
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,790
And 25 years later,

467
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:17,044
I found some of his followers
and went after them.

468
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,381
Hence, I beseech you.

469
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,383
Prime Minister Koo.

470
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,635
Do not pull the gag.

471
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,222
Do not use the word "honesty"
as your weapon.

472
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,267
Please focus solely
on the safety of the people.

473
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,769
That's it for now.

474
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,442
-Are you preparing the brief?
-Yes.

475
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,444
Would that summary be enough?

476
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,862
Yes, Your Majesty.

477
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,456
I'm Jo Hye-mi from Haejung Daily.

478
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,709
I heard that His Majesty called a man
"Traitor Lee Lim"

479
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,586
on the night of January 25.

480
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,882
Lee Lim was supposedly shot to death.
Is there a chance that he may be alive?

481
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,594
We were asked the exact same question
25 years ago,

482
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,805
and the Royal Court's answer
remains the same.

483
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,058
It's impossible.

484
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,395
His Majesty found
one of Lee Lim's followers.

485
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,606
His Majesty chased him but lost him.

486
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,444
Go ahead.

487
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,654
You just mentioned
the traitor's followers.

488
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,491
Why do you think they resurfaced?

489
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,952
As the royal court's press secretary,

490
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,082
I have no interest in their intentions.

491
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,461
The Royal Court's only concern is
to hunt them down

492
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,088
and bring them to justice.

493
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:43,923
-Next.
-Here!

494
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,883
-Over here!
-Here!

495
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,596
A cell phone?

496
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,807
What do you mean?

497
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,395
A smartphone and a 2G phone.

498
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,980
You had two cell phones.

499
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,732
I don't get it.

500
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,858
I'm sure you do.

501
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,407
This phone. It's yours, right?

502
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,331
This phone had something
that had to be kept confidential,

503
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,209
but your friend happened to hear it.

504
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,547
That's why you killed her
according to the script you read.

505
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,968
Because you were sure
that someone will get you out.

506
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,306
Right?

507
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,102
Who gave you this phone?

508
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:40,980
Like I said...

509
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,693
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

510
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,695
What do you think?

511
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,738
I think you're right.

512
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,679
I managed to trick her
with Lee Sang-do's phone,

513
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,931
but I wonder where she hid hers.

514
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,936
Hey, are you listening?

515
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,567
Did you spot something outside?

516
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,654
What? Do you know whose car that is?

517
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,991
I may have seen it before. I'll drive.

518
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,996
PERSONAL INFORMATION

519
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,789
VEHICLE INFORMATION

520
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,754
VEHICLE REGISTRATION NUMBER

521
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,386
Zero.

522
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,389
If it's the car from the barbecue place,

523
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,017
then it's zero.

524
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,896
Chief, you never let me down.

525
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,566
REQUEST
PENDING APPROVAL

526
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,903
APPROVE
APPROVAL NUMBER

527
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,655
Could you approve this?

528
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,867
Why are you after that car?
What's it? Did something happen?

529
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,410
I'm about to find out.

530
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,580
This is Kang, Squad 3.

531
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,666
I put in a request. When can it be done?

532
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,168
Okay, thank you.

533
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,172
You need a partner.

534
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,841
You should partner up with Jangmi.

535
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,885
All right, I have to step out.

536
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,137
-Oh, Detective Shim.
-Yes?

537
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,056
You and I had a drink last night, okay?

538
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,518
Why? You picked me, out of everyone?
Wait, Chief! Hold on.

539
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,644
Hold on a second.

540
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,354
Chief.

541
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,107
Seriously, who are you meeting?

542
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,402
Solitude.

543
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,572
Jeez, come on. Chief!

544
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,117
See you later, sir.

545
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,997
Did you get information on the car?

546
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,832
It'll take about half an hour.

547
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,876
Order some food. I want dolsot bibimbap.

548
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,670
Then I'll order a steak--

549
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,757
Never mind.

550
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,635
Bibimbap for everyone, okay?

551
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,318
We worked so hard to protect this nation.

552
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,945
But a shoot-out at the start
of a new year?

553
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,947
With the traitor's followers?

554
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,867
You see, every family needs
a strong pillar,

555
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,619
but we have a woman prime minister.

556
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,079
That hen keeps on squawking
every single day.

557
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,499
No wonder even the traitor's followers
are causing a scene.

558
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,419
We are truly concerned
about His Majesty's safety.

559
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,338
You saw how Park Cheol-ung suffered.

560
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,132
If this isn't a terror attack, what is?

561
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,468
Your Highness, the timing is perfect.

562
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:01,347
Just express your deep concern
as the oldest member of the Royal Family.

563
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,682
-You just say the word--
-How insolent!

564
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,270
The most senior member of the Royal Family
is His Majesty, not I.

565
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,607
Other family and relatives
are to stay out of politics.

566
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,108
How many times must I tell you?

567
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,486
Get out of my house this instant!

568
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,406
Your Highness, His Majesty is here.

569
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,745
Your Majesty!

570
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,830
Your Majesty.

571
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,174
I hope I haven't caused
a misunderstanding.

572
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,220
They barged into my house unannounced.

573
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,764
I won't get the wrong idea.

574
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,894
How's everything with Se-jin?

575
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,358
She finished her residency
and has started her fellowship.

576
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,529
She's still clumsy though.

577
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,575
Se-jin will do a great job.

578
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,496
Will I

579
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,582
do a great job too?

580
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:13,752
Your Majesty.

581
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,922
By any chance...

582
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,510
Yes.

583
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,595
Traitor Lee Lim

584
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,056
is alive.

585
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,766
And he hasn't aged.

586
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,104
Because of that, I must leave
the palace again in a few days.

587
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,440
I ought to track him down.

588
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,859
And this rendezvous...

589
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,738
will not take place in the Kingdom.

590
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,285
Since you are second in line,
I need you to stay at the palace.

591
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,622
For me and for the Kingdom of Corea,

592
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,791
you must stay safe.

593
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,712
Your Majesty,
you will track him down yourself?

594
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,841
No, I cannot let you do that.

595
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,219
I know what you're worried about.

596
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,307
But I promise you
that I will protect myself.

597
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,186
So you must do the same.

598
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,521
Protect yourself.

599
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,899
This is a king's order.

600
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,448
Understood.

601
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,701
I will do so, Your Majesty.

602
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,875
Okay, thank you.

603
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,632
That car, 7370, is registered
under a missing person.

604
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,425
Sit down and have some food first.

605
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,559
It's common for punks who tail cops
to use cars with false registration.

606
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,104
But I wonder

607
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,984
if you were being tailed for much longer.
Why was it at the penitentiary?

608
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,986
Does anything come to mind?

609
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,197
Tell me more about that.

610
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,115
About what?

611
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,118
That place you went to.
The science fiction story.

612
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,339
Well...

613
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,967
I was there just for a day.

614
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,595
It is called the Kingdom of Corea,

615
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,889
and it's not a divided country.

616
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,560
So you can take the train
and go all the way up to Pyongyang.

617
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,311
TO PYONGYANG STATION

618
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,730
The capital city is Busan,

619
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,943
and there is a king
who is cherished by the people.

620
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,780
I even went to our station.

621
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,743
The uniform, the vehicles,
everything was different,

622
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,831
but I was so happy to see everyone.
I even saw Chief Park and Detective Shim.

623
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,751
As if they were destined to be,
they were cops

624
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,837
even in that world.

625
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,173
Then

626
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,427
I went to find you.

627
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,221
But you weren't

628
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,599
there.

629
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,562
Neither at the station
nor in Pyeongchang-dong.

630
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,232
Maybe you inherited the family business
and got rich?

631
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,611
Or maybe you live abroad. Lucky you.

632
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,616
I was here.

633
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,869
What?

634
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,582
Let's eat. We have to go somewhere.

635
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,459
Where?

636
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,515
LEE SANG-DO, JANG YEON-JI
KIM GI-HWAN, YANGSUN CARE CENTER

637
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,725
KANG HYEON-MIN

638
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,979
KANG SIN-JAE

639
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,653
LEE JI-HUN
OCTOBER 28, 1987 - DECEMBER 28, 1994

640
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,575
How do you know about this?

641
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,329
Gyeong-ran gave me reports
to pass along to you,

642
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,122
saying it's classified.

643
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,625
So I took a look

644
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,253
to see what you're after

645
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,214
and where you're headed.

646
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,552
And this is where I ended up.

647
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,641
I see.

648
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,313
I can tell you

649
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,983
who this boy is.

650
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,359
I know.

651
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,488
That's why we're here.

652
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,283
You couldn't find me in the other world.

653
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,786
I know why.

654
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,707
Why?

655
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,712
Do you know why I became a cop?

656
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,758
I hoped

657
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:17,180
I'd be holding a gun in my hand
when someone asked me

658
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,268
to identify myself.

659
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,480
So that I can either shoot myself or him.

660
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,776
What do you mean?

661
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,862
Who are you?

662
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,783
The day when Eun-sup wasn't the Eun-sup,

663
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:44,166
I called the name of the man
who claimed he was a king.

664
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,333
His name?

665
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,881
You mean, that unidentified man
told you his name?

666
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,175
No,

667
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,053
I just called his name.

668
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,222
The name that I remembered.

669
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,812
Lee Gon.

670
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,398
And I was right.

671
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,109
It's because I was here...

672
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,445
In this world...

673
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,032
with you.

674
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,828
I was the reason why you couldn't find me

675
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,624
in that world.

676
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,001
Me, Kang Sin-jae.

677
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,507
That is a fact.

678
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,970
But as for who I really am...
I'm not sure yet.

679
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,108
You were...

680
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:53,777
here.

681
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,612
You were here

682
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,366
all along.

683
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,785
But am I supposed to be here?

684
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,626
Will you...

685
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,088
welcome me?

686
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,122
How did you know?

687
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,544
You asked me to find
the traitor's followers,

688
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,338
but the traitor himself is alive.

689
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,758
Lee Lim. He's the talk of the town now.

690
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,219
Watch what you say.

691
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,015
Seeing how cautious you are about this,

692
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,225
it must be true.

693
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,023
All the videos of the scene
are completely gone.

694
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,150
Even from foreign servers.

695
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,152
Can KU find them?

696
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,447
Is your secretary's office that capable?

697
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,533
Why do you need them?

698
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,579
Do you want to catch the traitor

699
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,706
or become one yourself?

700
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,250
Just tell me whether or not
you can find them.

701
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,544
If I find them for you,
will I get out early?

702
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,839
How about the spring equinox?
I'll be out when spring begins.

703
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,553
In this country, special pardon
has never been issued in February.

704
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,722
An execution is more likely.

705
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,392
-How about Admiral Yi Sun-shin's birthday?
-April?

706
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,395
That's a long way ahead.
How about Gyeongchip?

707
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,606
Just rot here forever.

708
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,567
Fine. Then I'll find them
and keep them for myself.

709
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:03,281
Ribbit, ribbit, the frogs are singing

710
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:06,952
All together with the son, the grandson
And the daughter-in-law

711
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,829
Fine. Gyeongchip, it is.
When can you get them?

712
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,835
I'll call you.

713
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,838
I'll make my secretaries work late.

714
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:26,429
They sing all night but no one's listening

715
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,266
Even though no one is listening...

716
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,543
Prince Imperial Geum!

717
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,169
You...

718
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,173
You haven't aged one bit.

719
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,925
Why are you surprised?

720
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,595
You were the first person to find out
that I didn't die.

721
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,472
You've known for the longest.

722
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,102
-Anybody there?
-I'm pretty sure...

723
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:22,152
I slew all of them on my way here.

724
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,364
Don't be surprised.

725
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,118
I came to collect
what's rightfully mine, Jong-in.

726
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,459
Put it down.

727
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,587
It's the king's ring
that doesn't belong to us.

728
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,213
I was next in line to the throne

729
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,007
even if I was born to a concubine.

730
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,593
I am the rightful heir,

731
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,473
-so it belongs to me.
-Nonsense.

732
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,684
We dare not covet that ring.

733
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,228
"We"?

734
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,030
You and I can never be "we."

735
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:16,289
How can you identify with someone

736
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,875
who can kill you this instant?

737
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,044
Such insolence!

738
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,131
I will choke our dear nephew
just like this

739
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,343
and take the Manpasikjeok from him.

740
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:33,098
Then I'll be the only one in possession

741
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,600
of the Manpasikjeok.

742
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,647
I don't know the extent

743
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,691
of what I'll be able to do

744
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,778
when I'm in full possession of it.

745
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,114
To make that happen,

746
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,701
our dear nephew needs to suffer despair

747
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,370
and crumble away.

748
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,081
And for that reason,

749
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:03,211
I want him to lose
another person in his life.

750
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,552
You, to be specific.

751
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,283
Don't think this is unfair.

752
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:38,037
You're smart,
so I'm sure you saw this coming.

753
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,698
Why aren't you surprised?

754
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,575
Because I'm a curious person.

755
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,453
I hate seeing blood.

756
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,622
Did you fight?

757
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,459
I am in the middle of a fight.
I still have a long way to go.

758
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,172
What are you reading?

759
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,674
King Arthur.

760
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,262
It's a story about a man with noble blood
drawing a sword and becoming king.

761
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,515
Only those with noble blood
can become king?

762
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,017
That's a terrible story.

763
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,603
Forget noble blood.

764
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,941
The sword must be drawn
by those who know how to use it.

765
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,817
What if a villain draws the sword?

766
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,903
Someone who is not just.

767
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,030
Justice doesn't make the sword.

768
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,033
The sword decides what justice is.

769
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,329
It seems that the things in your world
keep changing.

770
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,998
Anyway, goodbye.

771
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,335
I want to know how this story ends.

772
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,475
-Did you come alone?
-Are you expecting someone?

773
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,817
I know the room service is pretty good,

774
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,528
but I thought you might want
some home-cooked food.

775
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,585
Since you're here,
I need to show you this.

776
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,006
I gave this to your king.

777
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,552
Right. His Majesty left it with me,
but I can't look up anything on it.

778
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,725
I see.
This is why he brought all that change.

779
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,979
Why can't you look up? Is there no Wi-Fi?

780
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,566
You'll see why.

781
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,985
I can't even say it.

782
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,707
Want to see what I've been looking up?

783
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,753
A king never leaves any traces.

784
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,799
Are you working now
or just doing day-to-day stuff?

785
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,344
To me, every moment in your world

786
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,804
was scandalous.

787
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,641
Because of Jeong Tae-eul.

788
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:52,148
I'm amazed that you didn't delete this
all this time.

789
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,447
All deleted. You can now use it.

790
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,367
I thought you'd want to keep it.

791
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,703
I'll remember it.

792
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,375
We shouldn't leave evidence, you know.

793
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,711
Those from your world
shouldn't leave any traces

794
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:15,630
in this world.

795
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,133
You know what?

796
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,763
Besides His Majesty himself,
you're the only one

797
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,557
who can delete what His Majesty wrote.

798
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,188
Can you handle it?

799
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,983
-Handle what?
-Everything that will happen

800
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,819
after Lee Lim is caught.

801
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,489
You two belong to different worlds.

802
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,283
Will you travel back and forth?

803
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,995
His Majesty is the king of a country.

804
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,873
He needs to be with someone
who'll become queen.

805
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,751
Can you abandon everything you have here

806
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,630
and become the queen
of the Kingdom of Corea?

807
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,968
And keep the two worlds a secret

808
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:04,971
forever?

809
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,775
Your Majesty.

810
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,111
Your Majesty...

811
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,284
What's the matter?

812
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,039
Buyeong...

813
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,584
His Highness Prince Buyeong...

814
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:23,049
His Highness Prince Buyeong...

815
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,575
Ma'am!

816
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,660
Ma'am!

817
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,956
Ma'am.

818
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:38,708
Ma'am.

819
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,962
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

820
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,239
Earlier today,

821
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,659
it was very sunny.

822
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,538
Because it was so sunny,

823
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:19,790
I wondered

824
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,877
if you would've been able

825
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:28,424
to gather your strength
to finally sprout today.

826
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,262
So I rushed home.

827
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:58,431
Hey.

828
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,518
How have you been?

829
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,233
It took you

830
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,610
a while this time.

831
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:18,200
Because I had to come from far away.

832
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:23,456
I realized...

833
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,918
that I never gave you a single flower.

834
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,087
That's why...

835
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,175
I crossed the universe for you.

836
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:07,917
But the thing is,

837
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,215
I have to go back now.

838
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:17,343
Going back?

839
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:22,515
Right.

840
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,812
I also realized I never told you this.

841
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,615
I love you.

842
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,914
I am deeply...

843
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,503
in love with you.

844
01:09:58,777 --> 01:09:59,945
There will come a moment

845
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:04,158
when it seems I've disappeared.

846
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,413
I don't want you to worry too much
when that happens.

847
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:12,833
It just means...

848
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,379
I'm walking
through the frozen moments in time.

849
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:43,173
Gon.

850
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:48,387
It's me,

851
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:49,888
Jeong Tae-eul.

852
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,474
I'm...

853
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,020
headed to the palace now.

854
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,399
I'll hurry. I'm on my way there now,

855
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:03,027
so look for me

856
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,113
when you get this message.

857
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:09,700
