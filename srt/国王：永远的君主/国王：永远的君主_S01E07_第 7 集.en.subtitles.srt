1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,813
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS-

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,982
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,837
It was the year
after he committed treason,

4
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,590
so it's been 24 years.

5
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,885
EPISODE 7

6
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,638
Back then and even now,

7
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,475
the view here has always been stunning.

8
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,146
It seems too nice

9
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,399
for a traitor's resting place.

10
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,446
I thought about it sometimes.

11
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,492
What was that body?

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,248
Are you still bothered by how
we announced that the guards killed him?

13
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:10,588
Back then, that was the only way
to protect the Royal Court.

14
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,924
I know.

15
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,344
And I made that choice.

16
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:25,186
Sometimes, life flows
in unexpected directions.

17
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,567
This is the death certificate

18
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,821
where the real cause of
Prince Imperial Geum's death is written.

19
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,910
Usually, when two people

20
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,997
have a conversation like this,
one of them kills the other.

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,251
That's an absurd joke...

22
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,554
Is there something going on?

23
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,767
What did you talk about with His Majesty?

24
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,145
About the truth.

25
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
I'm sorry,

26
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,611
but I hid something from you as well.

27
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,113
It was neither a suicide

28
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,158
nor a shooting by the Royal Guards.

29
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,993
That body

30
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,331
wasn't Prince Imperial Geum's.

31
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,919
Your Highness!

32
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,380
That traitor Lee Lim

33
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,008
is alive somewhere.

34
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,230
If the purpose of his treason

35
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,315
had been the Manpasikjeok

36
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,150
and not the throne,

37
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,278
since I have its other half,

38
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,240
he will definitely

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,409
come to me to retrieve it.

40
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,163
So...

41
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,668
Head Court Lady Noh was wrong.

42
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,967
Jeong Tae-eul is not a danger to me.

43
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,469
I am

44
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,721
a danger to Jeong Tae-eul.

45
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,281
Quick firing is kind of hard.

46
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,199
Right?

47
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,037
What?

48
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,707
Did you put holes in it beforehand?

49
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
Couldn't you have secretly
shot some on mine?

50
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,211
Wow, Lieutenant Kang Sin-jae.

51
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,380
I guess you'll get promoted first.

52
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,675
You should've worked
at the National Police headquarters.

53
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,345
Why would you work here when you graduated
from the National Police University?

54
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,347
All your classmates are Senior Inspectors.

55
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,890
You still have no clue about me.

56
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,393
I'm not jealous at all
that they're Senior Inspectors.

57
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,062
Then why are you so bent
on taking the promotion test?

58
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,189
Because my friends
are all Senior Inspectors.

59
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,276
Don't worry, my physical abilities
can make up for my low scores.

60
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,028
It won't help with the written exam.

61
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,740
Hang on. I've got a call.
Oh, it's our Chief.

62
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,951
Yes, Chief.

63
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,788
All right, I'll be there right away.

64
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,209
There was a murder in Changsin-dong.

65
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,294
You drive.

66
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,385
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

67
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,928
Your Majesty.

68
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,972
Is the schedule confirmed
for China's visit?

69
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,850
We should wait
until you've got plenty of rest--

70
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,812
I want it scheduled as soon as possible.
What other official schedules are there?

71
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,399
You have to go to the National Tax Service
to receive the Best Taxpayer Award.

72
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,818
-The people are responding positively.
-Great.

73
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,280
You can receive the award on my behalf.
And ask the Prime Minister's Office

74
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,241
-if they can make theÂ report in advance.
-Well...

75
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,409
That is enough.

76
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,370
Don't try to convince me otherwise.

77
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,873
How early do you want
the state affairs report?

78
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,791
Tomorrow.

79
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,043
-Tomorrow?
-Yes, if not, His Majesty will accept

80
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,127
a written report.

81
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,713
This is annoying.
Does he think I have time on my hands?

82
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,714
Prime Minister.

83
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,633
Was I being too nice these days?

84
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,843
Let's play a little hard to get.

85
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,179
Just send a simple written report.

86
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,389
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,894
Your outfits for the National Assembly
this afternoon.

88
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,356
We've referred to female politicians
of various countries

89
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,690
and selected these suits.

90
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,025
They're all pants.

91
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,153
Well, most members are males,
so we picked more masculine outfits--

92
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,824
Do women in politics have to wear
suits like that to win?

93
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,910
I'll try to win
wearing the clothes that I like.

94
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,703
Go and have lunch.

95
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,588
What did that bitch have that I don't?

96
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,677
Jangmi.

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,137
-Hey, you're here.
-Yes.

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,056
Go, get out of here.

99
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,516
I'll get the security footage.

100
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,561
-Take him away from here.
-Stop contaminating the crime scene. Go.

101
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,814
The victim is a 26-year-old female,
and the weapon is a kitchen knife.

102
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,399
It was reported by her roommate.

103
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,193
Okay, I'll get her statement.

104
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,111
Okay.

105
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,821
Excuse me.

106
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,533
I'm Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul
from Jongno Station.

107
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,163
I know you're in shock, but you need to
come to the station to make a statement.

108
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,373
Right now?

109
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,541
Yes.

110
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,761
Give me a briefing.

111
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,680
There are two wounds on her neck,

112
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,640
but her posture is natural.

113
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,809
She was attacked by surprise
while lying down.

114
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,146
The first wound was critical.

115
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,107
With a cut this deep,
she couldn't have put up a fight.

116
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,442
There are no signs of entry

117
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,736
and she had a facial mask on.

118
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,571
The killer was likely an acquaintance.

119
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,550
Why is the weapon so clean?

120
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,220
The killer put it back where it was
after washing it.

121
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,055
They tried to get rid of the evidence.

122
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,306
So it's a first offender.

123
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,767
Even kids know
they should wear latex gloves.

124
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,186
Hey, our vulnerable Jangmi.

125
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,395
Did you find anything?

126
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm certain that Yu Jeong-hwa
from the Royal Wardrobe

127
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,237
is the one who's been meeting
the Prime Minister's secretary.

128
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,739
There cannot be any mistakes
regarding this issue.

129
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,200
Based on when the guards changed posts,

130
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,537
a total of 32 palace workers
met His Majesty in person this month.

131
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,914
And 21 of them have social media accounts.

132
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,709
I followed around 40 personal accounts
that they use, and I found this.

133
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,421
The same location, the same table
from a different angle,

134
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,006
and photos in the same style.

135
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,925
And most importantly,

136
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,594
their faces are reflected on these spoons.

137
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,935
It's totally obvious, then.

138
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,608
A palace worker spying on
His Majesty and spreading rumors,

139
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,779
and even stealing and leaking something
from the palace...

140
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,282
That qualifies as treason.

141
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,409
Who put you up to this?

142
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,496
Who ordered you to spy on His Majesty?

143
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,668
Head Court Lady Noh, I'm sorry.

144
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,172
I said His Majesty seemed to have
gotten a girlfriend,

145
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,466
but I never stole anything.

146
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,470
I was on duty on November 11th,

147
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,848
and His Majesty came to the Royal Kitchen.

148
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,058
And he cooked food himself.

149
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,893
So I could tell right away

150
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,855
that his girlfriend had come.

151
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,774
All right.

152
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,193
I can tell

153
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,195
that you are not lying.

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,114
However,

155
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,325
you are still fired.

156
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,372
Come with me.

157
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,584
Yes.

158
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,586
Since we share a studio apartment,

159
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,590
I leave the house for about an hour
whenever her boyfriend comes over.

160
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,759
And where did you go?

161
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,969
A convenience store nearby.

162
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:42,350
I have an audition soon,
so I read my script and went back, and...

163
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,441
Please tell me everything you know
about the victim's boyfriend.

164
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,404
His name's Park Jung-gu.

165
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,865
I don't know his exact age, though.

166
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,368
I think he's in his late 20s.

167
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,203
I heard he's still a student.

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,040
Do you know his social media account?

169
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,376
Yes.

170
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,463
Here.

171
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,799
Thank you.

172
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,886
VIEW PROFILE

173
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,805
NAME: PARK JUNG-GU
BIRTHDAY: JUNE 6, 1992

174
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,474
You shouldn't leave the city or go abroad
for a while.

175
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,226
And answer when we contact you.

176
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,146
Name, Park Jung-gu.

177
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,023
Born on June 6th, 1992.

178
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,863
Park Jung-gu, age 28. I have his address.

179
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,451
His number matches the one
in the victim's call records. It's him.

180
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,577
All right...

181
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,997
Detective Shim?

182
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,457
We have the suspect's address.

183
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,335
I'll text it to you, so head there
right away. No detours.

184
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,671
I'll go and check the witness's alibi.

185
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,923
Okay, go do that.

186
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,176
All right.

187
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,561
I checked Jang Yeon-ji's alibi.

188
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,063
She was at the convenience store
at that time.

189
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,482
I'll drop by Forensics before I head back.

190
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,823
PARK MUN-HAENG OF HG GROUP'S
SUCCESSION PROCESS UNDERWAY

191
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,507
It must have been a tough day.

192
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,968
Get some rest, Father.

193
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,282
I checked the security footage
of the building Park Jung-gu lives in.

194
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,326
He didn't go home after the incident.

195
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,369
This jerk went into hiding.

196
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,290
Forensics says a detailed autopsy report
will only be available after three weeks.

197
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,168
The cause of death is excessive bleeding
from multiple wounds.

198
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,420
The wounds match with the kitchen knife.

199
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,089
How can we wait
three weeks for the report?

200
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,966
You should've asked for Hee-ju's help.

201
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,051
Didn't you mention me?

202
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,844
I did. About your loneliness.

203
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,766
I see.

204
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,270
You had to mention that out of
all the things you could've said about me.

205
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,647
Of course. I had to.

206
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,565
I wrote and signed a note promising that

207
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,818
I will never call you out
after 10 p.m. again.

208
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,070
So you even wrote
and signed a note for her.

209
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,739
Wow, you're really unbelievable.

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,616
We'll talk about this later.

211
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,493
All right, everyone. Listen up.

212
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,788
-What is it? What about loneliness?
-What is it?

213
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,624
What's that secret code you're using?
It sounds pretty fishy.

214
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,709
Tae-eul, you of all people

215
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,879
shouldn't be asking questions like that.
Don't you think?

216
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,842
Out of 100 points for your promotion test,
do you know what takes up 47 points?

217
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,344
The immediate supervisor's
work evaluation score?

218
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,804
That's right.

219
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,640
Usually, everyone just gets
full points for that.

220
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,600
Do you want to lose all those points?

221
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,727
I don't care.

222
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,146
What is it?
What did you mean by "loneliness"?

223
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,440
I could visit Forensics tomorrow myself.

224
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,985
Hey, I can just give you 470 points
on your evaluation

225
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,237
and send you off to headquarters.

226
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,948
That's enough out of you. Listen up.

227
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,993
Jang Yeon-ji is still one of the suspects,

228
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,327
so keep investigating her.

229
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,997
For now, Park Jung-gu
is our prime suspect.

230
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,125
Put him on the wanted list
and find the regular routes he takes.

231
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,543
And do stakeouts. That's all.

232
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,502
Yes, sir!

233
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,018
Come on, let's go.

234
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,770
It's better to just get it over with.

235
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,856
No, it's not. You have no idea.

236
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,496
LOTTERY
5,000 WON

237
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,374
Wow, you won 5,000.
Let's go buy rice cake skewers.

238
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,584
No.

239
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,794
I'm going to save these.

240
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,296
Save 5,000?

241
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,342
Yes, I'm going to save up
and win 50 million.

242
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,761
I just have to save ten thousand of these.

243
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,972
But you always buy ten thousand
in lottery tickets.

244
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,860
Where did you spend
that ten thousand you won?

245
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,946
What do you mean?

246
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,574
You know, you won ten thousand
when I went to the Taekwondo center.

247
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,076
Oh, that?

248
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,329
I saved it to get double eyelid surgery.

249
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,123
And?

250
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,669
What do you mean, "and"?

251
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,588
Look at my eyes.

252
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,761
If I had managed to save it,
I'd have double eyelids right now.

253
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,721
But I don't.

254
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,272
So, should I get the surgery now?

255
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,776
Don't waste your money.

256
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,571
You're right.

257
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,991
That's why
I spent it on rice cake skewers.

258
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,038
But while we're on the topic...

259
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,791
I was really pretty back then.

260
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,751
I was young,

261
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,087
pure,

262
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,047
gentle,

263
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,384
and intelligent.

264
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,262
I only read professional books back then.

265
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,849
Teaching Methods and Utilization
of Basic Taekwondo Techniques.

266
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,183
Are you drunk?

267
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,769
How many big words have you just misused?

268
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,604
What?

269
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,398
Jangmi and Detective Shim are coming.

270
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,899
You're going home, right?

271
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,235
Yes.

272
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,864
I'm finally getting off work.

273
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,700
Gosh. I wonder where Jangmi...

274
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,578
buys clothes like that.

275
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,456
No one can tell we're cops
when he is with us.

276
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,833
Gangsters take him with them
when they run from us.

277
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,902
Your Majesty, China's Foreign Minister
and the Chinese ambassador are here.

278
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:53,947
Let's go.

279
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,034
China remembers your kindness.

280
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,120
Thank you very much

281
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,582
for the great Kingdom and Your Majesty
who rescued the fishing boat.

282
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,379
I heard
pink lotus flowers represent trust.

283
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,549
I am glad to be sharing a cup of lotus tea

284
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,635
with the two representatives of China.

285
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,762
Thank you, Your Majesty.

286
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,806
To thank Your Majesty for your sincerity,

287
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,974
we also prepared a gift.

288
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,769
From the new year,
all citizens of the Kingdom of Corea

289
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,396
will be able to visit 661 cities in China

290
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,649
without a visa.

291
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,737
It's...

292
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,281
an amazing thing

293
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,537
for anyone to be able
to go anywhere, at any time,

294
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,914
as they wish.

295
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,336
Your country's gift will be remembered
as a precious moment of history.

296
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,723
-Hey, you're here.
-What?

297
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,976
Why? Is it weird?

298
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,688
The customers said it looked nice.

299
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,189
What should I get you?

300
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,027
I was just startled.

301
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,029
My palms are sweaty.

302
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,906
Did you get a haircut?

303
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,704
I'll get chocolate milk tea.
Use this. And I want lots of cereal.

304
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,792
You know I always want
to cut my hair short

305
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,460
around this time of year.

306
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,462
I tried wearing a wig.

307
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,090
But I look better with long hair, right?

308
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,386
You're coming here
less often these days, though.

309
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,680
Are you going to a different cafe?

310
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,351
Hey.

311
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,146
You're much better than my dad.

312
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,733
He didn't even notice
when I stayed out all night.

313
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,986
You've gotten better at bluffing
since I last saw you.

314
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,864
Who describes stakeouts like that?

315
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,574
You were just working.

316
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,872
No, it wasn't a stakeout.

317
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,959
I really spent the night at a guy's house.

318
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,462
His house was pretty big.

319
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,007
Welcome to my palace.

320
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,428
Good for you.

321
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,103
It's crunchy.

322
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,816
By the way, Na-ri.

323
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,736
Let's say

324
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,447
there's another world,

325
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,658
and...

326
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,869
there's someone who looks
exactly like you there.

327
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,164
How would you feel

328
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,833
if you met that someone?

329
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,585
Are you talking about doppelgangers?

330
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,587
I'd have to kill her, of course.

331
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,799
Hey. How can you say such a thing
in front of a detective?

332
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,052
One of the doppelgangers
always ends up dying.

333
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,929
That's the rule of the universe.

334
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,192
Why is that the rule?

335
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,195
If there's two of something
when there's just supposed to be one,

336
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,822
it will cause chaos in the world.

337
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,409
One cafe in this alley is enough,

338
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,495
and Hero Taekwondo center is enough
for this neighborhood.

339
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,080
The world needs balance.

340
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,042
Tae-eul, why else would NASA
hide the existence of aliens?

341
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,335
If there are two worlds,

342
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,964
then one world
is bound to destroy the other.

343
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,009
We can't be the ones destroyed.

344
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,690
I have to go now.

345
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,817
Take care.

346
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,570
Just take me to the bamboo forest today.

347
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,658
Answer quietly, all right?

348
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,869
Your Majesty!

349
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,299
I didn't know Your Majesty was coming.

350
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,176
Did your schedule change?

351
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,179
The weather was nice,
so I just dropped by.

352
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,931
-All right, Your Majesty.
-Go on with your work, then.

353
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,937
Go.

354
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,954
Giddy-up!

355
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,592
No wonder.

356
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,887
I thought it was too easy
exiting the palace.

357
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,555
Were you waiting here?

358
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,766
Where are you going again
with your phone off?

359
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,519
-Are you going to meet Luna again?
-Who's Luna?

360
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:17,938
Your Majesty,

361
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,856
you've been deceived.

362
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,943
That woman isn't Jeong Tae-eul.

363
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,070
She's a criminal called Luna.

364
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,363
I'm pretty sure she's not.

365
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,156
She's the one catching criminals.

366
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,408
Your Majesty...

367
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,912
Gangsters and the police
are all looking for that woman.

368
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,624
Document forgery, theft, breaking
and entering, assault, pickpocketing...

369
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:41,253
There are hundreds of reports on her.
She just hasn't been caught yet.

370
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,255
So you're saying

371
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,384
that there's a woman
with the same face as Jeong Tae-eul

372
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,970
in this Kingdom, right?

373
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,557
Not the same face.

374
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,144
-It's the same person.
-And where is this person called Luna?

375
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,187
I'm sure you would know better than anyone

376
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,189
where she is right now.

377
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,607
The same face

378
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,318
exists

379
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,112
in the Kingdom of Corea.

380
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,782
Even if you look at me like that,
you can't go.

381
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,368
If you must go,
you'll either have to kill me

382
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,619
or take me with you.

383
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,704
Make your choice.

384
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,248
-I choose number one.
-I'm better than you with swords.

385
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,291
Then number two.

386
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,211
How can you be joking right now?

387
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,256
I told these jerks to stand by.

388
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,429
Don't worry about the palace
and enjoy your vacation.

389
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,015
-Vacation?
-It's Ho-pil, right?

390
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,601
I texted Ho-pil saying

391
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,645
you're going on a long vacation.

392
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,439
I'm going on vacation?

393
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,232
Yes, we're leaving our horses behind.

394
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,069
I believe two horses in that yard
is a bit too much.

395
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,864
You didn't read the link I sent you,

396
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,325
and you won't believe me
even if I explain it to you.

397
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,119
So, I'm just going to take you there

398
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,121
so you can see for yourself.

399
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,081
See what for myself?

400
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,625
What's between one and zero.

401
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,753
And that Jeong Tae-eul
and the person you're chasing

402
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,087
are different people.

403
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,673
And then I'll find that person

404
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,842
with the same face as Tae-eul.

405
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,360
Your Majesty...

406
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,863
This is just the beginning.

407
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,907
We're going to be

408
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,243
entering another world now.

409
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,653
Prince Imperial Geum!

410
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,161
You idiot.

411
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,582
Don't bow to people like that
with my father's face!

412
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,458
Stand up.

413
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,545
Our conversation will last a while.

414
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,714
Yes, Your Highness.

415
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,842
So what will you do?

416
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,219
The succession process is almost over...

417
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,889
but that idiot is dawdling.

418
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,368
He's left the palace again.

419
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,720
Why does he keep leaving?

420
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,808
It keeps getting postponed.

421
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,145
Why don't you do something?
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

422
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,613
What do you want to do

423
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,948
after the succession process is over?

424
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,701
It's simple.

425
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,953
We'll say he got sick and retired

426
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,915
and send him off somewhere abroad
since he's done with his work.

427
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,001
Do you agree with that?

428
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,381
I will do as you order, Your Highness.

429
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,383
He's acting like that again!

430
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,385
What a load of nonsense.

431
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,887
I'm the one who asked you
to bring that idiot,

432
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,847
but he only listens to you, and not me.

433
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,516
-Damn it!
-The succession...

434
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,644
will end smoothly.

435
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,728
That's obvious!

436
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,730
I'm asking when that will happen! Shit.

437
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,777
And if it's nothing urgent,
let's just talk over the phone, all right?

438
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,405
Stop ordering me to go back and forth...

439
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,033
What?

440
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,285
What?

441
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,497
What...

442
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,207
You...

443
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,842
You should let your son
take over the business.

444
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,010
Your real son.

445
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,430
Your Highness!

446
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,724
Shit! You...

447
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,601
What are you jerks up to?

448
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,831
Damn it...

449
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,315
No, no...

450
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,816
No!

451
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:41,154
HG Group has made an official announcement
that the succession process will end

452
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,363
by the end of the year,

453
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,658
and that Chairman Park Mun-haeng
will step down from his position.

454
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,787
The succession that has been
taking place for two years

455
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,205
is finally coming to a close.

456
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,582
Chairman Park's son, Park Byeong-u,

457
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,627
will become the next chairman
and take over the business.

458
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,215
Take good care of the palace.

459
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,758
I'm taking Yeong with me.

460
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,052
I'll come back in time by Friday,
so don't worry.

461
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,012
Your King.

462
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,892
Oh, my head. Oh, my heart.

463
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,826
It was neither a suicide

464
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,955
nor a shooting by the Royal Guards.

465
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,665
That body

466
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,626
wasn't Prince Imperial Geum's.

467
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,593
Secretary Mo, it's me.

468
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:51,933
Tell the portrait painter tomorrow morning
to finish up the painting quickly.

469
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,438
It looks like His Majesty is wearing
a white outfit stained with blood.

470
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,399
It makes me uncomfortable.

471
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,241
CASE REPORT

472
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,411
NAME: JANG YEON-JI
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM: ROOMMATE

473
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,217
CASE REPORT

474
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,135
NAME: UNKNOWN

475
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,638
Then let's say it's Kim Gae-ddong
for convenience's sake.

476
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,223
"Gae-ddong" as in dog poop?

477
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,308
DATE OF BIRTH: UNKNOWN

478
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,809
I'm three years older than you.

479
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,525
I've finally...

480
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,320
met you,

481
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,239
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

482
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,535
ADDRESS: UNKNOWN
CONTACT: UNKNOWN

483
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,792
I thought my name was
not supposed to be called,

484
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,797
but I guess it was supposed to be called
only by you.

485
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,386
LEE GON

486
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,983
SAVE CHANGES?

487
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,288
DO NOT SAVE

488
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:43,711
HERO TAEKWONDO CENTER

489
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,539
How...

490
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,458
have you been?

491
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,923
Have you been waiting for me?

492
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,679
That's a relief.

493
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,558
I was a bit scared

494
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,395
that you didn't

495
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,814
want me to come back--

496
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,719
How do you have the key?

497
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,138
Did you meet my dad?

498
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,765
He seemed happy to see me,

499
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,767
but he was sad
that I didn't bring Maximus.

500
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,769
I borrowed the key for a while.

501
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,771
You borrowed the key? Why?

502
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,314
Oh, my God!

503
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,066
Hey, Jo Eun-sup.

504
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,652
What are you doing here?

505
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,737
Where are the twins?

506
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,572
You should've brought them.

507
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,367
Hey, but what's with your outfit?

508
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,495
And your hair...

509
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,125
You're not...

510
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,128
Eun-sup.

511
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,970
That bitch doesn't have a home
or an identity.

512
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,224
We must get her while she's in our sight.
Otherwise, we can't.

513
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,353
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul...

514
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,731
You brought Jo Yeong here?

515
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,149
It was unavoidable.

516
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,652
He wouldn't let me go alone.

517
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,861
What is this place?

518
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,822
I totally understand

519
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,199
how you feel.

520
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,453
I'm sure we both have a lot of things
to worry about,

521
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,208
but for now, welcome
to the Republic of Korea.

522
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,584
Republic...

523
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,170
I heard Captain Jo went on vacation.

524
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,174
Yes, he only sent one text
to the sub-captain,

525
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,801
so the team is worried.

526
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:41,139
He's getting some rest
while His Majesty is staying in his study.

527
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,392
He'll be back around Thursday evening,
so don't worry.

528
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,727
I have a job for you in the meanwhile.

529
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,980
Yes, Head Court Lady Noh.

530
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:57,780
Bring me a list of court workers on duty
and the people who visited the palace

531
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,576
from November 11
to midnight the day after.

532
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,455
Check anyone who has ever
so much as touched the palace.

533
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,626
What about the one you fired last time?

534
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,670
No.

535
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,047
She's not the thief I'm looking for.

536
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,258
It's someone else.

537
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,146
I can't even get a signal.

538
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,983
I've never seen him act like that.

539
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,694
He looks so cute when he's flustered.

540
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,281
Your carefree attitude is what's cute.

541
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,075
How can you just bring someone
with the same face?

542
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,077
What are you going to do
if he gets caught?

543
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,829
That's why I borrowed this place.

544
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,041
Yeong isn't the type to get caught easily.

545
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,337
It's King Arthur!

546
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,297
The lights were on, so I was wondering...

547
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,564
Eun...

548
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,196
You two haven't met, right?

549
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,614
Why don't I introduce...

550
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,371
Well, I guess we could say
you've met already.

551
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,250
Anyway, this is my guard,
the Unbreakable Sword, Jo Yeong.

552
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,377
And this is a guard of a police station...

553
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,714
Hey! Jo Eun-sup!

554
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,927
I can't believe it! You made him faint!

555
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,805
What? Did you say he wouldn't get caught?

556
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,267
Eun-sup was also raised
as a precious only child

557
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,644
until his twin siblings were born.

558
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,188
What are you going to do
if something happens to him?

559
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,106
Eun-sup!

560
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,190
Jo Eun-sup!

561
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,608
Oh, my gosh!

562
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,402
What happened?

563
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,445
Tae-eul...

564
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,741
I literally just saw someone
who looked exactly like me...

565
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,369
Wow...

566
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,371
He's right here.

567
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,378
What the hell is this?

568
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,048
He looks exactly like me.

569
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,135
No.

570
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,262
He is me.

571
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,433
Who are you?

572
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,101
And who are you?

573
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,062
Eun-sup.

574
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,564
Let me explain.

575
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,734
So this is like a parallel universe
or something.

576
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,652
Don't get too startled, all right?

577
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,073
I didn't realize until now,
but I'm pretty handsome.

578
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,910
You really didn't know?

579
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,955
How could you not know?

580
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,709
I'm sure people around you
would've told you all the time.

581
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,754
Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,633
Hang on, that's not the point here.

583
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,306
So then this means
everything was true, right?

584
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,808
The Kingdom of Corea really exists,

585
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,977
and King Arthur here really is the King?

586
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,020
Wow.

587
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,521
Wow...

588
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,442
Then you're the King's bodyguard, right?

589
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,777
No.

590
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,573
Are you doing military duties right now?

591
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,866
Yes.

592
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,660
-Is military service compulsory here?
-What do you mean?

593
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,204
Is it different where you live?

594
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,624
-We have a volunteer military system.
-Yes, I guess it could be different.

595
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,044
What? Then you don't need to...

596
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,094
Why don't we...

597
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,013
go to his house first?

598
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,807
It'll be the safest there.

599
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,646
What's that guy doing?

600
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,483
A security check. It's his job.

601
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,986
Everything is clear.

602
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,490
Wow, I guess you can tell
just by looking around.

603
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,575
You look pretty professional.

604
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,452
Why don't you?

605
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:19,375
I guess you don't know,
but I'm his Unbreakable Sword.

606
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,795
Your boss wouldn't have been
able to go home if it weren't for me.

607
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,213
Did you even know that?

608
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:27,758
Well...

609
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,927
Something came up.

610
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,265
What would you know?

611
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,059
Your Majesty,

612
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,563
I just realized my 63rd dream.

613
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,857
In my next life,

614
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,193
I really want to be
a citizen of your Kingdom.

615
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,740
I won't allow that.

616
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,494
All right, why don't we have dinner first?

617
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,247
How about half and half?

618
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,416
Yeong should try it too.

619
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,295
You're crazy.
How can you think about chicken right now?

620
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,005
I'll shoot him if you order me to.

621
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,298
What...

622
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,262
Hey! Put that down.

623
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,890
You can't use a gun! It's illegal here.

624
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,817
Both of you, sit down.

625
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,959
We need to make some rules.

626
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,088
You'll stay here until you find
another place to stay.

627
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,133
And you shouldn't
be outside at the same time.

628
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,552
During the day, Eun-sup can go out.

629
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,262
And Mr. Jo can go out at night.

630
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,765
-Why should I?
-Why should I do that?

631
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,017
Do you have a death wish?

632
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,352
No.

633
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,313
I'm talking to both of you.

634
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,318
If it's a problem that we look identical,
we can solve it by eliminating one.

635
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,031
What?

636
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,493
Why are you all looking at me?

637
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,037
Wait.

638
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,415
Gosh, I was trying to live a quiet life
without causing trouble.

639
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,251
Don't regret this later saying

640
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:28,212
"I didn't know you'd do this," okay?

641
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,130
Eun-sup.

642
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,967
I got you fruit and some other stuff.

643
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,511
Don't leave the house, okay?

644
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,267
And Mr. Lee, follow me.

645
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,143
How dare you call His Majesty that...

646
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,731
Is this how they've been
treating you here?

647
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,233
Yes,

648
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,026
I missed it.

649
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,697
She used to just call me
"Hey" or "Mister."

650
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,407
Hey...

651
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,202
Don't kill him,
he belongs to the government.

652
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,845
Where are your parents?

653
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,264
In Busan. I'm from Busan.

654
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,852
Do your parents have the same faces, too?

655
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,148
Who are they?

656
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,317
Did you get married?

657
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,694
They're my twin siblings.

658
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,404
They're in Busan for the holidays.

659
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,365
Don't you have siblings?

660
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,075
No, I'm an only child.

661
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,453
An only child.

662
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:47,041
Well, I guess your parents
weren't as close as mine.

663
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,917
They got divorced.

664
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,255
Oh, I'm sorry.

665
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,885
Do you want a hug?

666
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,388
Gosh! You really have a bad temper!

667
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,807
I bet you don't even have a girlfriend.

668
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,267
Neither do you.

669
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,310
I have a boyfriend.

670
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,021
-What?
-Did you believe that?

671
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,231
You're more gullible than I thought.

672
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,484
Did you eat?
If you didn't, I'll make something.

673
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,320
Nobody is stupid enough
to eat at an enemy's camp.

674
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,575
Do you guys usually talk
like you're in a historical drama?

675
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,370
Come to think of it,
you don't talk in a dialect.

676
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,872
I can use standard Korean, too.

677
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,751
Do you want to eat something?
Would you like some noodles?

678
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,586
Is there anything you can do properly?

679
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,298
How can someone have 63 dreams?
Are you making deposit accounts or what?

680
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,510
Which one has the highest
chance of getting fulfilled?

681
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,805
Becoming a civilian, of course.

682
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,517
I'm fulfilling that dream in two days.
My military service ends in two days.

683
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,728
In two days you'll become a bum
who doesn't even protect the country?

684
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,064
Hey, you're pretty harsh.

685
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,484
You know, you might have
more muscles than me,

686
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,236
but I'm pretty good at fighting too.

687
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,737
Try me.

688
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,285
Don't think about shooting me from behind.

689
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,871
The Republic of Korea...

690
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,457
What kind of country is this

691
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,626
to let a fool like you
protect the country?

692
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,063
TAEKWONDO CENTER

693
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,489
Here, this is my MSD.

694
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,700
Try it. It's somaek. Drink all of it.

695
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,208
It's quite similar.

696
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,338
Unlike someone,
my salary is chicken feed,

697
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,924
and I don't have a mountain
full of rare-earth elements.

698
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,177
So I bought it
with a 12-month installment plan.

699
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,472
Don't break it and take care of it.
Don't forget to answer my calls.

700
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,099
I saved all the numbers you will need
in this world.

701
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,852
It seems like you bought it
and waited for me to come back.

702
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,524
Why did you save Sin-jae's number?

703
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,860
They are the five people who will help you

704
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,987
regardless of anything in this world.

705
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,907
And Sin-jae
is one of the most trustworthy people.

706
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,325
Not you?

707
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,868
For me, the citizens come first.

708
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,666
Who are you calling?

709
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,132
LEE GON

710
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,261
Is it you?

711
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,640
-Hang up.
-Don't hang up.

712
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,767
I always wanted to try this.

713
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,811
What is this?

714
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,646
Just a normal daily life with you.

715
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,272
Call you...

716
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,149
Chat on the phone...

717
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,568
Ask you what you did today...

718
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,404
And tell you that I missed you

719
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,114
a lot.

720
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,912
Me too.

721
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,206
I see.

722
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,709
Here is the chicken you ordered.

723
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:18,961
Enjoy.

724
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,431
I'm tasting it beforehand
since I can't cook.

725
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,184
You don't have to.

726
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,728
I know our worlds
are completely different.

727
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,481
But let's try to shorten the gap.

728
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,741
This also tastes great.

729
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,536
Fine, but let go of my hand.

730
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,620
Never.

731
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,872
Then grab my left hand.

732
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,967
Why did you put those sunglasses on?

733
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,094
We have somewhere to go after we eat.

734
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,847
It's a daily life I've been planning
for a long time.

735
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,350
You know, I get nervous
when you equip something.

736
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,395
Is this the place?

737
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,441
Welcome...

738
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,402
Oh, it's you again.

739
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,406
You brought your girlfriend today.

740
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,701
If you hit the target seven times,
you can win this.

741
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,453
How many bullets do you want?

742
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,538
Seven is enough.

743
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,916
Right, of course.

744
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,418
Are you going to try this time?

745
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,503
Right. You can hit them
with your eyes closed

746
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,131
if you have a boyfriend
who's served in the military.

747
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,090
Yes.

748
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,069
Did you have a boyfriend
who's served in the military?

749
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,987
"With my eyes closed" is the point here.

750
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,334
Can you really see with that on?

751
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,797
Shooting is the act of filling the void
between me and the target.

752
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,300
It's too late if you shoot after you look.
You need to look after you shoot.

753
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,261
What else do you need?
Should I shoot down a star for you? Bang!

754
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,932
Are you sure you earned this?

755
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,266
Or did you just pay for it?

756
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,104
If we have time,
let's go to Hongdae next time.

757
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,690
There's a teddy bear as big as you.

758
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,899
Hongdae?

759
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,735
Is that the name of a neighborhood?

760
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,654
Then do you know

761
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,408
what "the relationship between
Hongdae and Kondae" means?

762
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,577
They're both universities.
They're not that close to each other.

763
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,787
Who told you about that?

764
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,664
I know I have just met you,

765
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,917
but what exactly is the relationship
between you and Lieutenant Jeong?

766
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,378
The relationship between
Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny?

767
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,671
Between two and three?

768
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,756
The relationship between
Hongdae and Kondae?

769
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,760
So it's not close.

770
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,430
But I like both places.

771
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,600
Why do you like them?
When they're so far away?

772
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,060
Why are you taking his side?

773
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:23,937
Take whose side?

774
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,981
What are we even talking about?

775
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,149
You don't need to know.

776
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,277
How can you be a detective
when you have no clue

777
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,486
about how people feel?

778
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:34,990
Just forget it.

779
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,451
Let's go back to our daily life.

780
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,704
I need to be comforted.

781
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,581
So I will hold your hand.

782
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,170
Let's not do this.

783
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,298
We don't know
when we'll see each other again.

784
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,148
Answer me without letting me go.

785
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,066
I won't.

786
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,028
I wanted to ask as soon as I saw you,
but I was holding back.

787
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,657
I waited for you as a detective,
but also as myself all this time.

788
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,041
Has something happened?

789
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,919
Were you threatened by someone?

790
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:32,964
I guess that means

791
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,300
it will happen.

792
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,678
That's why you came.

793
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,056
What is it?

794
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,935
Is there

795
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,978
a dome stadium

796
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,107
named K Stadium
in the northern region there?

797
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,276
With 16,890 seats?

798
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,612
How do you know that?

799
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,823
Did you look that up too?

800
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,536
We're screwed.

801
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,834
Give this to Director Hwang
of the care center.

802
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,544
It's this month's electricity fees.

803
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,465
Why are you giving him money
two days in advance?

804
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,300
He'll take it for granted soon.

805
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:23,390
-Are you going to the other world again?
-I do everything in advance,

806
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,643
but I won't bring the man with your face
too quickly, so don't worry.

807
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,732
You can never be sure
about people, though.

808
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,490
US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA

809
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,367
People...

810
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,622
The northern K Stadium created a big buzz
even before its construction.

811
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,374
As the first-ever dome stadium,

812
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,043
it is four-stories tall,
and has two basement levels

813
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,045
with a seating capacity of 16,890...

814
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,548
Is it?

815
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,885
Yes, it's news from my world.

816
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,846
But you found it here?

817
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,351
Who else knows about this?

818
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,770
Just me for now.

819
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,900
I can't really tell anyone about this.
Nobody will believe it anyway.

820
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,277
What are you thinking of doing?

821
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,737
I need to investigate further.

822
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,114
This was my case

823
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,283
before I even met you.

824
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,329
It could be more dangerous than you think.

825
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,209
That's why I thought about
just covering it up.

826
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,085
But...

827
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,964
if I cover it up,
then no one will ever find out about this

828
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,011
since there would be only two people
who know about this.

829
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,597
Me

830
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,432
and the culprit.

831
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,727
The two worlds
shouldn't get mixed up like this.

832
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,147
They're supposed to stay
on their respective paths.

833
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,024
But

834
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,818
the two worlds are already colliding,

835
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,654
and I've discovered it.

836
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,574
So what else could I do?
I decided to investigate.

837
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,870
I'm a police officer
in the Republic of Korea.

838
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,337
So tell me anything you know about this.

839
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,632
This is a cooperative investigation
that only we can do.

840
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,890
And the order of command?

841
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,226
I'm your superior, of course.

842
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,894
I give the orders here.

843
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,076
You've been carrying this around?

844
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,997
You're carrying lots of stuff around.

845
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,879
Lee Lim? That's...

846
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,715
Yes, the traitor.

847
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,509
If he's alive, he'll be 69 right now.

848
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,596
You should find someone who matches
his age, blood type, and fingerprints.

849
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,058
In my world, his body was found
the year after he committed treason.

850
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,435
But the body...

851
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,812
was someone else's.

852
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,106
If Lee Lim is alive...

853
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,485
He's here

854
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,363
using that body's identity.

855
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,531
That's right.

856
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:32,370
We have to figure out what
he's done here for the past 24 years.

857
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,750
I'll look into it.

858
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,295
But until I find something,
do just 17 things.

859
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,423
Stay quiet,

860
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,926
don't draw people's attention,
don't tell anyone you're a king,

861
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,638
keep Jo Yeong out of trouble,
don't use any guns,

862
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,391
contact me whenever you go somewhere,

863
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,771
and I'll tell you the rest
when I think of any.

864
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,440
I'll do as you order.

865
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,152
Do just two things for me.

866
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,864
Don't tell me not to come,

867
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,741
and don't tell me

868
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,701
not to leave.

869
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:17,999
I have to go back sometimes,
and when I do, I want to come back soon.

870
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,293
Whichever it is,

871
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,420
if you tell me not to come or leave,

872
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,340
I don't think I'll be able to do anything.

873
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,303
So

874
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,015
I'm asking you not to get exhausted.

875
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:40,939
I feel like a lousy man

876
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,234
after saying that.

877
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,986
Am I?

878
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:56,329
I'm confused about which part
you were nodding to.

879
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,000
You should go now.

880
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,877
Yeong will be waiting for you.

881
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,547
He'll be anxious
since he doesn't know where you are.

882
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,882
Why would you think Yeong
doesn't know where I am?

883
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,013
He's following us around here too?

884
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,391
I guess I've made you curious.

885
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,560
I'll be off now.

886
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,812
There's something else...

887
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,190
I'm curious about.

888
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,652
Am I really not in your world?

889
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,947
Eun-sup and Jo Yeong,
Na-ri and that palace worker...

890
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,907
Even this person

891
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,118
had the same face.

892
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,829
Do I really not exist there?

893
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,420
I do, don't I?

894
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,265
How is it sleeping in the night duty room?

895
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,687
My wages are garnished, right?

896
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,274
Come on, don't say it like that.

897
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,818
There's an official term for that.

898
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,111
Seizure.

899
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,281
I'll get it handled soon.

900
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,618
The night duty room smells nice.
It's good.

901
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,120
Of course, it does.

902
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,415
Jangmi handed out questionnaires
asking what flower you liked.

903
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,460
It took three whole days
to decide that it was lavender.

904
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:29,589
Next time,

905
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,550
tell him I like mugwort.

906
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,385
Mugwort?

907
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,235
Why? Is something outside?

908
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,070
Is it snowing?

909
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,698
Do you still like snow at your age?

910
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,660
I really like snow.

911
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,037
I get teary when it snows.

912
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,498
Well, it's not snowing much this year.

913
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,751
Hey, the beef is burning.

914
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,129
Do you think they flip themselves over
when it gets hot?

915
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,381
My gosh.

916
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,841
You never had expensive beef before,
have you?

917
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:33,820
Sin-jae.

918
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,115
Sin-jae.

919
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,450
Honey! Honey, Sin-jae is awake!

920
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,744
Sin-jae. Can you recognize me?

921
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,455
Sin-jae.

922
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,635
I found someone
with matching fingerprints.

923
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,722
Lee Seong-jae, died 24 years ago.

924
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,808
He died from natural causes
at Yangsun Care Center.

925
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,351
What case is this for?

926
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,230
Well, I got a report.

927
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,152
Born 1951, same blood type...

928
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,031
Class two physical disability?

929
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,159
He was born with poliomyelitis.
Call me with any questions.

930
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,452
-I'm busy.
-Yes. Thank you.

931
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,959
His brother died from a hit-and-run,
and his nephew died in an accident.

932
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,837
What happened to this family?

933
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:43,806
So Lee Gon

934
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,516
was here too.

935
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,524
MR. JO EUN-SUP,
THANK YOU FOR USING OUR HOTEL

936
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,126
I finished the security check.

937
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,091
You haven't checked your expression.

938
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,927
We're going to stay here for a while.

939
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,179
I brought plenty of gold this time.

940
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,723
Your Majesty.

941
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,268
You must return to the palace.

942
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,979
I can't protect you here, Your Majesty.

943
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,899
What is this place, and how long
have you been coming here?

944
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,651
You Majesty,

945
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,029
we don't have a life here.

946
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,241
You've endured a lot,

947
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,576
Captain Jo.

948
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:49,831
Yeong.

949
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,542
I can't leave the palace permanently

950
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,752
or give up coming here altogether.

951
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,338
So you have to help me.

952
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,632
I'm going to go back Thursday evening,

953
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,009
but I'm going to leave you here.

954
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,972
-That is why I brought you with me.
-You're talking nonsense right now.

955
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,057
One more person...

956
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,936
who doesn't belong here
has been added to this world.

957
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:19,610
There's a chance that the traitor Lee Lim
is still alive.

958
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:22,989
What...

959
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,742
do you mean?

960
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:30,246
You and Eun-sup, Tae-eul and Luna.
The same faces.

961
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,915
Don't you get it?

962
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,505
Let's say your theory is correct.

963
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,591
What if he's in our world?

964
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,385
In our world, there are enough reasons
and people...

965
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,429
to kill him.

966
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,559
But there aren't any here. Only you.

967
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,602
But Your Majesty...

968
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,354
MR. JO EUN-SUP,
THANK YOU FOR USING OUR HOTEL

969
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,537
This is the third time.

970
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,833
This may be a rule, not a side effect.

971
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:17,960
What rule is it?

972
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,505
What do I know so far?

973
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,549
The Manpasikjeok...

974
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:25,676
Lee Lim...

975
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,721
The bamboo forest...

976
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,309
I have to block that forest.

977
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,743
My job is to protect you.

978
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,078
Yeong.

979
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,039
Lee Lim is going
back and forth just like me.

980
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,834
And I think time stops whenever he does.

981
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,627
You stopped moving just a moment ago.

982
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,797
I'm sure he already knows...

983
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,216
that I've left the palace.

984
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,386
But I don't know

985
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,305
if Lee Lim left here or came here.

986
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,058
I have to go back...

987
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,143
and find that out.

988
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,062
All right.

989
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,940
I'll believe you, so prove it.

990
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,276
Show me proof...

991
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,278
that time stopped.

992
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,613
Check your left pocket.

993
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,206
IS THIS ENOUGH PROOF?

994
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,374
Is this enough proof?

995
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:42,670
Yeong.

996
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,756
He and I each have
half of a certain object.

997
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,134
If I lose my half to him,

998
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,138
he'll be the only one who can open
the door between our worlds.

999
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,097
Then,

1000
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,851
we'd lose our lives in our world as well.

1001
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,147
That's why...

1002
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,110
you must kill him as soon as you find him.

1003
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,532
It's a King's Order.

1004
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,828
Captain Jo.

1005
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,414
Your phone's off so I'm leaving a message.

1006
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:23,210
I found that woman called Luna
I told you about last time.

1007
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,421
But the strange thing is,

1008
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,132
the fingerprints you gave me last time

1009
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,843
matched Luna's.

1010
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,095
That's why I called you.

1011
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,723
The funny thing is though...

1012
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:40,186
She already got arrested for larceny,

1013
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,606
so she was actually in jail.

1014
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,317
0631 SPECIAL LARCENY

1015
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,369
Prime Minister Koo.

1016
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:57,912
Prime Minister Koo.

1017
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,289
I'm off work.

1018
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,625
This is nine-minute care.

1019
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,044
Stretch your body for nine minutes.

1020
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:14,887
Your face will literally light up once you
hear this while you are getting the care.

1021
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:18,307
The Royal Court sent a set of fingerprints
to the forensics.

1022
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,851
And it turned out to be a woman.

1023
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,187
But there is something weird about it.

1024
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:26,065
Her identity was unknown

1025
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,693
until she was arrested...

1026
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,072
Forget it. Give it to me.

1027
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:41,330
0631 SPECIAL LARCENY

1028
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,791
What? This girl is an ex-convict?

1029
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,920
And she went into prison
in that short period of time?

1030
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,046
You know her?

1031
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,507
Do I?

1032
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,217
It's scary if you do know her.

1033
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,429
She has a history of forgery, trespassing,
assault, theft, and so on.

1034
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,388
She's unbelievable.

1035
01:06:57,471 --> 01:07:01,100
Another thing is, she'll be released soon
and she was locked up not long ago.

1036
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,309
Released?

1037
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,811
When?

1038
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,193
YANGSUN CARE CENTER

1039
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,216
I was planning on telling you
when I was sure,

1040
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:36,927
but I think there is someone

1041
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,221
with your face in my world.

1042
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,433
Parallel worlds,

1043
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,143
same faces,

1044
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,437
same ID card,

1045
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,397
balance...

1046
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:52,234
Where did my new ID card disappear to?

1047
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:53,652
Who

1048
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,030
is keeping the balance?

1049
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,509
Send things that need to be sent
and throw away useless ones.

1050
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,471
There was somethings we received
from your home.

1051
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,640
-From my mom's house?
-Yes.

1052
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:26,811
FROM KIM SEONG-AE

1053
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,105
You can head home now.

1054
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:30,856
All right.

1055
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,408
"North Korea"?

1056
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,745
Donald Trump is the US President?

1057
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:47,873
What is this?

1058
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,502
They're really not controlling fake news.

1059
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:04,849

DONGNAE PENETENTIARY

1061
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,801
Good to see you again.

1062
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,596
We've met before, right?

1063
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,942
Hey, this was my last cigarette.

1064
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:39,902
What are you going to do?

1065
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,452
The very first time you came here...
would you have fallen for me?

1066
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:34,415
-It would've led me to fall for you.
-I'm going to kill that man over there.

1067
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,083
You have to catch him.

1068
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,919
Get the money ready.
The bills with the King's face.

1069
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:40,337
What happened?

1070
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,881
So he first killed himself
and then killed me.

1071
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,634
You're a miracle to me.

1072
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,177
I saw something weird on it.

1073
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,264
Jang Yeon-ji has two cell phones?

1074
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,433
I can switch it off and on
whenever necessary.

1075
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:55,269
You must be one of those
who stood on my father's blood.

1076
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:57,104
Will I be able to catch up with you?

1077
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,939
Hands off unless you want to die.

1078
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,108
Do I exist in this world?
