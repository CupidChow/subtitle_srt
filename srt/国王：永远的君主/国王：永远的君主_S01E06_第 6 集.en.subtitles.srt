1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,480
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,982
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,986
Ma'am.

4
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,078
The royal helicopter was just approved to
make an emergency landing on KU Building.

5
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,039
His Majesty is coming to Seoul?
At this hour?

6
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,792
Men usually do this when their girlfriends
miss the last train or bus.

7
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,712
When their girlfriends went to Seoul
and missed the last train back to Busan.

8
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,715
But there's no way
His Majesty has a girlfriend.

9
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,258
What could it be?

10
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,937
Did you have an appointment with her?

11
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,979
No way.

12
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,773
I'm here to pick you up.

13
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,150
But I have to keep a low profile.

14
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,737
If they see you,
just who will they think you are?

15
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,697
Don't worry.

16
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,950
I'll try not to look suspicious.

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,036
You are a fool.

18
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,914
The situation is already quite suspicious.

19
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,841
I'm seeing you at an unexpected hour,
in an unexpected place,

20
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,385
with an unexpected person, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
You're right.

22
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,222
And you've put me in an awkward situation.

23
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,517
This is a very personal occasion.

24
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,145
I should have given you a heads-up

25
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,355
since you would be notified of this.

26
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,773
I'm sorry I kept you at work.

27
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,361
When it comes to the countryâ€™s affairs,
personal occasions are business too,

28
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,155
and you are my country.

29
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,160
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,246
I'm Koo Seo-ryeong, the Prime Minister
of the Kingdom of Corea.

31
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,712
It's nice to meet you.

32
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,714
I'm a big fan.

33
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,675
I'm flattered

34
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,845
to have such a young and beautiful fan.

35
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,305
May I ask your name?

36
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,603
I'm a traveler.

37
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,315
I'm honored
just to be able to see you like this.

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,108
I'm leaving soon.

39
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,072
This is my first time
in the Kingdom of Corea.

40
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,325
I feel like I'm in a storybook.

41
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,787
It's your first time here,
but you speak our language well.

42
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,957
Well...

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,168
I studied liberal arts.

44
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,467
Let's call it a day, Prime Minister Koo.

45
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,427
I don't have much time today.

46
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,514
You have a long journey ahead.

47
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,516
After you, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,268
I will send you off.

49
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,979
Okay, then. See you on Friday.

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,524
-Let's go.
-Okay.

51
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,910
Are you worried
I might fall for Prime Minister Koo?

52
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,245
Don't worry.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,373
I know someone prettier.

54
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,919
That's right.

55
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,838
She's that person.

56
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,048
Your gaze was saying a lot.

57
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,509
Wow.

58
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,930
What are you looking at?

59
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,559
The moons are the same.

60
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,394
Do you also have...

61
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,857
Later.

62
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,491
What?

63
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,167
Do we also have what?

64
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,177
Do you also have the myth
about rabbits living on the moon?

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,894
There are no rabbits on the moon,
liberal arts student.

66
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,605
The moon is
the closest celestial body to the earth--

67
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,822
The surface of the moon
is covered with regolith.

68
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,012
I smile for you. But you...

69
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,977
You smile at moments like that.

70
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,091
Why are we in the kitchen?

71
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,385
Are you going to have me sleep
here tonight?

72
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,389
If you're staying the night,
I'll have you sleep in my bedroom.

73
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,017
Now that Secretary Mo knows,
almost everyone around me knows about you.

74
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,399
Let's eat.

75
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,401
Yeong told me

76
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,070
that you didn't eat anything
but one sandwich all day.

77
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,201
I'm repaying you

78
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,245
for the half and half.

79
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,821
You didn't give me money
on purpose, right?

80
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,407
You knew we had different currencies.

81
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,242
Right.

82
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,453
You don't have buttons.

83
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,209
I didn't want you to go far away.

84
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,835
That's why I sent Yeong.

85
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,882
The credit limit was 100,000 won.

86
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,635
I borrowed it from him,
so pay it back for me.

87
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,719
I will.

88
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,517
I was

89
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,478
traveling around today,

90
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,317
and I realized you must have been
lonely in my world.

91
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,490
Were you lonely here?

92
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,785
It was frustrating to not have something

93
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,454
that could prove my identity.

94
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,332
Thanks for coming to pick me up.

95
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,377
Would you come here for a second?

96
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,926
-Do you need any help?
-Look at me.

97
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,477
I want to pat your head,
but both my hands are busy.

98
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,652
It doesn't seem like your first time.

99
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,363
What do you mean? Dating?

100
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,657
Why? You didn't get any results
from web-searching?

101
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,662
Why do you cook so well?

102
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,081
I thought you were making me
some instant noodles.

103
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,541
You said it didn't taste good.

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,042
It was good.

105
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,130
That's why I didn't believe
that you cooked it yourself.

106
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,632
Head Court Lady Noh taught me how to cook.

107
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,387
The only food that I don't need tasted
is the food I cook myself.

108
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,764
I saw you looked it up online.

109
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,559
"Prince Imperial Geum" and "Lee Lim."

110
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,360
You...

111
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,655
seem to have grown into a fine man.

112
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,957
I guess you now know

113
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,753
what root you are standing in front of.

114
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,015
It's my hell

115
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,142
and my history

116
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,270
that was engraved on my body

117
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,691
by the greed of the person
that killed my father and strangled me.

118
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,404
Which is why I was raised
amid my uncle's worries

119
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,239
and Head Court Lady Noh's tears.

120
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,410
And that's the reason
why Head Court Lady Noh isn't nice to you.

121
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,537
Don't be upset about it.

122
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,668
Is that it?

123
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,172
After hearing a story like this,
don't you have to either give me a hug

124
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,591
or at least say you would give me one?

125
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,267
Aren't you going to show me my ID card?

126
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,438
I need to go now.

127
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,445
I won't let you go.

128
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,115
You have to live here.

129
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,328
I'm serious. I won't let you go.

130
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,789
I can keep you here

131
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,460
with just one command.

132
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,974
What are you doing?

133
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,393
Well, I heard from the news earlier

134
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,062
that there will be a cold wave
starting from tonight.

135
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,441
It'd be nice to take you to my place,
but you won't.

136
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,986
Can I not watch the news
in the night duty room?

137
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,822
My mom bought this
from a pyramid scheme company.

138
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,118
It doesn't mean she's into it.
She only purchased their product.

139
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,999
But it's really soft and warm.

140
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,253
Blankets are innocent.

141
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,716
It kind of looks like
it's paying for its sins though.

142
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,886
What's that?

143
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,515
I have it on when I sleep.
Lavender helps you sleep soundly.

144
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,686
You sleep with things like that
every night?

145
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,813
Yes.

146
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,026
Actually, I grew up sheltered and--

147
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,985
Get out.

148
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,070
Okay. I will see you tomorrow.

149
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,661
Good night.

150
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,134
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

151
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,275
Hello, is this the police?

152
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,239
I'm behind the playground
near Samjung Apartment Complex.

153
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,825
Six boys are beating one kid.

154
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,535
Is she crazy?

155
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,080
Hey, hang up the phone already.
Do you want to die?

156
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,959
Yes. I'm Jeong Tae-eul,
a student of Bukchon High.

157
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,420
The six bullies are wearing
the uniforms of my school.

158
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,757
What are you waiting for?
Go take her phone.

159
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,348
You crazy bitch. Do you have a death wish?

160
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,409
Hey.

161
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,411
I know your face

162
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,496
and I know where you live.

163
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,167
Hey!

164
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,212
I know your face too.

165
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,756
So don't you think of fleeing.

166
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,384
I'm a black belt.

167
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,013
But when it's two against six,
it counts as self-defense.

168
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,931
I don't go easy on men.

169
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,529
It's your fault. You've spoiled him!

170
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,869
We should probably have
the kid transferred.

171
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,955
Seriously, when will you grow up?

172
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,139
-Where are you going?
-None of your business. Out of the way.

173
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,391
I said, where are you going?

174
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,393
Anywhere. Why?

175
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,520
Why would you go anywhere?

176
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,242
Come to this place.

177
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,371
Come and start over from a white belt.

178
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,126
Courtesy, integrity, perseverance,
self-control, and indomitable spirit.

179
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,962
You're not following any of these.

180
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,758
I had perseverance.
That's why I let them beat me.

181
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,224
Then you can start with a yellow belt.

182
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,643
I can't cut you any more slack.
Put them on.

183
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,496
HEROES TAEKWONDO CENTER

184
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,752
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

185
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,391
Yes.

186
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,186
Yes.

187
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,317
Did you check the facts?

188
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,821
Okay.

189
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,286
Summon the NSC right now

190
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,954
and cancel all my appointments
for tomorrow.

191
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,213
I thought you'd need it,
so I made it easy for you.

192
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,299
I'm sure you won't find anything, though.

193
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,552
We have our eyes on her too

194
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,513
because she's committed
various crimes like theft and assault.

195
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,931
What is she called again?

196
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,932
Luna.

197
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,226
You know, the one
we were chasing last time.

198
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,188
Captain Jo.

199
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,069
Sorry I had you come
all the way to the palace.

200
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,321
Don't worry. I was on my way home anyway.

201
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,365
This is what I talked about on the phone.

202
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,953
I will get back to you
as soon as we find a match.

203
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,747
Okay.

204
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,170
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL SECURITY
NSC SUMMONED AT 10:00 P.M.

205
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,966
-I will be waiting.
-Okay.

206
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,682
Take your time.

207
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,228
I will show you the ID card
after you finish it.

208
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,732
Thanks for the food.

209
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,493
Steak and rice in a hot pot.
It's my signature dish.

210
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,537
Everyone falls for it.

211
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,497
I can see why.

212
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,583
You should ask me whom I cooked it for.

213
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,752
I said it to make you jealous.

214
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,340
I can't beat that person anyway.

215
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,344
Whoever it is,
that person must be from this world.

216
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,951
I have been carrying it around
ever since you came here.

217
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,121
I didn't show it to you
because I was afraid you might leave.

218
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,747
But...

219
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,127
you've already gone somewhere
much further away than your world.

220
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,467
Take a look.

221
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,017
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

222
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,228
The navy jacket.

223
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,689
It's mine.

224
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,858
It's my ID card.

225
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,071
How does this make sense, though?

226
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,115
It's definitely mine.

227
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,076
Did you say it's been here for 25 years?

228
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,916
Someone dropped it here.

229
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,794
But my memories are fading away.

230
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,590
I'm not sure
if I can recognize that person.

231
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,134
But...

232
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,930
I feel like the person will appear
before me at least once.

233
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,473
Why?

234
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,600
Because that person
is either the beginning

235
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,144
or the end of all this.

236
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,942
It seems like
a difficult question to solve,

237
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,653
but there must be
a simple and beautiful formula for it.

238
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,781
And you are the answer
I have been looking for.

239
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,991
From now on, I will prove it one by one.

240
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,328
Whoever it is,
and whichever world the person is from,

241
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,914
you've beat that person.

242
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,002
So don't you decide alone
to leave like that.

243
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,102
Your Majesty.

244
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,562
Prime Minister Koo has assembled the NSC.

245
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,525
I wanted to send you back in the morning,

246
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,735
but I guess I should let you go
earlier than that.

247
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,821
I don't think I can see you off.

248
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,030
Don't worry about me.

249
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,492
NSC is the National Security Council.

250
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,203
Did something happen?

251
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,749
At 2230 hours, the battleships
of the Japanese Navy led by the Aegis

252
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,918
are moving toward
the south-southeast of Dokdo.

253
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,547
Prime Minister Koo urgently assembled
the NSC to respond

254
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,758
to Japan's unusual activity,
foreshadowing a strong response.

255
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,064
This is a strict warning.

256
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,775
Your ship is near the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea now.

257
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,235
Stop sailing further.

258
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,070
We are warning you again.

259
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,572
Stop sailing further.

260
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,492
Japan insists that the search radar
the Yi Sun-sin Destroyer

261
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,911
used to search fishing boats
is a fire-control radar,

262
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,372
and it shows the Kingdom of Corea's
intention of attack.

263
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,750
What about the Chinese fishing boat?
Was it rescued?

264
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,918
It's still underway.

265
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,421
The weather conditions in the East Sea
are poor at the moment.

266
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,757
If the Prime Minister reaches out,
put me on the phone.

267
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,674
Yes, Your Majesty.

268
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,345
Please bring my guest's belongings first.

269
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,513
And I will explain the situation myself.

270
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,538
What's this?

272
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,546
JEONG TAE-EUL

273
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,260
This is the control room.

274
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,348
It's me. Could you please confirm

275
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,226
if anyone has come into my room
since last night?

276
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,936
That would be difficult.

277
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,272
As you requested,
we've had Gwangyeongjeon restricted

278
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,650
from everyone in the palace
since 8:00 p.m. yesterday.

279
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,026
All the CCTVs are off as well.

280
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,736
Did something happen?

281
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,239
I will call you back.

282
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,834
According to the rules of engagement,

283
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,087
we made a warning announcement
and are now defending ourselves.

284
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,005
I see.

285
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,175
What are the features
of the Japanese battleships?

286
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:54,599
SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 missiles are loaded
on the Japanese ship Aegis,

287
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,893
as well as ASROC.

288
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,645
And ASROC is--

289
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,480
It's an antisubmarine missile.

290
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,733
That's right.

291
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,445
-We have it too, don't we?
-Yes, we do.

292
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,240
We sent an Aegis that is loaded
with Tomahawk missiles as well.

293
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,575
Prime Minister Koo.

294
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,869
This isn't the first time
Japan has done this.

295
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,789
Why don't we talk them into going back
for the sake of our relationship?

296
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,375
We can't start a war
every time this happens.

297
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,335
Maybe it keeps happening

298
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,296
because we never have started a war.

299
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,007
This is the third time this year.

300
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,302
The first two times,
we talked them into going back.

301
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,680
And this time,
they came back with an Aegis ship.

302
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,766
What do you think will happen
the fourth time?

303
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,977
We don't know until it happens.

304
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,189
They are just throwing a tantrum
before the trade negotiation.

305
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,524
War isn't easy.

306
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,860
Let's make more warning announcements
and wait.

307
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,069
Wait for what?

308
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,821
Did we order food?

309
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,702
The Japanese Navy is now sailing toward
our territorial waters.

310
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,955
At this rate, they will enter
our waters in 20 minutes.

311
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,915
You all heard that.

312
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,169
If you want to wait,
do so when you become Prime Minister.

313
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,671
I will not stand for this anymore.

314
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,674
I want all the troops
to prepare for action.

315
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,800
Prime Minister Koo.

316
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,303
You know we need
the permission of His Majesty.

317
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,221
I do.

318
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,264
Call the Royal Palace.

319
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,392
The Aegis and three more battleships
of the Japanese Navy

320
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,853
are currently sailing toward
our territorial waters.

321
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,147
I commanded our troops
to prepare for action.

322
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,067
Of course, there is a lot of opposition.

323
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,778
Politics must not be considered
regarding national security.

324
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,238
Did you do so?

325
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,991
The future of our 400,000 soldiers
and 90 million citizens is on the line.

326
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,660
No political idea was taken into account.

327
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,789
If you say so,
I was thinking of a different approach.

328
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,416
By "a different approach," do you mean...

329
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,212
I will do just as my ancestors did.

330
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,755
Your Majesty.

331
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,132
When two countries are true to themselves,
a war breaks out.

332
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,677
Japan is true to themselves,

333
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,012
so we must be true to ourselves too.

334
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,682
We won't sit back and watch.

335
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,897
Not even by one centimeter
and one millimeter can Japan enter

336
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,942
our territorial waters.

337
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,533
Your Majesty.

338
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,369
I know you're busy at the moment,

339
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,956
but something in the palace was stolen.

340
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,585
The guest's ID card is gone.

341
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,548
I tried my best to keep it secure,
but I guess it wasn't enough.

342
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,884
I will find out who did it and--

343
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:35,927
Head Court Lady Noh.

344
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,805
I know this might sound odd,

345
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,350
and I can't explain why,

346
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,063
but I feel that everything
that is happening now was meant to be,

347
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,733
and it was all set in motion 25 years ago.

348
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,988
Why are you suddenly saying that?

349
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,783
I will explain further when I get back.

350
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,911
Just wish me good luck for now.

351
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,832
Your other talisman actually worked.

352
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,586
Please take the talisman with you.

353
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:14,007
Actually, the talisman
is supposed to be used that way.

354
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,434
Could you two give us a moment?

355
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,546
I will give this one to you.

356
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,715
It seems it was supposed to be
passed on to you.

357
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,176
I hope this doesn't put you in trouble.

358
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,015
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

359
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,105
So you were in the navy?

360
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,565
I left the military as a Navy Lieutenant.

361
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,359
I'm not sure if you'll believe this,

362
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,029
but I'm the Commander-in-Chief
of the Kingdom of Corea.

363
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,281
I believe you.

364
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,575
Finally.

365
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,415
You said your country was
about to go to war with Japan.

366
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,085
So this was what was happening
in the Kingdom of Corea.

367
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,004
The Royal Family puts on military uniforms
at the most honorable time.

368
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,716
It means we will certainly win.

369
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,635
I will come back to you with honor.

370
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,761
It won't take long.

371
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,473
"Come back"?

372
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,934
Will you wait for me?

373
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,776
I will see you again, Gon.

374
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,536
I thought my name was
not supposed to be spoken,

375
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,915
but I guess it was only
supposed to be spoken by you.

376
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,656
I'M BORED, LET'S PLAY POOL

377
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,451
Who won the pool game?

378
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,953
Sorry for the late reply.
I went somewhere.

379
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,664
I'm fine if you're fine.

380
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,750
Jangmi won the game.

381
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,145
Could you wash your hands quickly
and help me with the eggs?

382
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,066
Dad.

383
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,319
You must have been startled.

384
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,530
I tried to contact you,

385
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,075
but I was Alice in Wonderland.

386
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,452
So I couldn't call you or anything.

387
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,872
You must have been really worried.

388
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,208
I'm so sorry, Dad.

389
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,336
Were you not at home?

390
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,713
You didn't know?

391
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,756
No, I didn't.

392
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,218
Goodness! Go peel the eggs.

393
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,345
So you didn't know.

394
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,847
Peel all of them.

395
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,308
Where were you, though?
Were you working undercover?

396
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,811
Forget it.

397
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,022
Hey, by the way,
the horse in the yard is gone.

398
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,483
Did the owner take it back?

399
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,407
Obviously, you don't care

400
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,909
about where your daughter went,

401
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,078
but you wondered where the horse went.

402
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,001
There will be no conversation
between us for some time now.

403
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,252
For a long time.

404
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,464
How could the owner
take the horse without telling me?

405
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,216
I even made him coffee.

406
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,845
We talked a lot in front of the horse.

407
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,139
He shouldn't have said
that he likes it here.

408
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,683
He could have at least said goodbye.

409
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,601
Gosh.

410
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,519
I can't believe it.

411
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,814
Could you not think out loud?

412
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,525
How could he sneak out
with the horse like that?

413
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:43,985
Let's eat.

414
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,069
Dad...

415
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,071
He said he would come back soon,

416
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,532
but he didn't come back for a long time.

417
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,743
The culprit is heading to the building!

418
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,499
-Why are you coming out of there?
-I'm sorry, sir!

419
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,098
Damn it. Where should I go?

420
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,683
Not there.

421
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,310
No, no. Okay!

422
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,523
Where? Okay.

423
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,697
You brat!

424
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,172
I wasn't holding my phone

425
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,633
as if I was waiting for someone.

426
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,929
I was just waiting on Earth,

427
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,890
which has become slightly rounder.

428
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,560
There was no way I could know

429
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,771
what was happening in his world.

430
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:08,152
Because he was a person
who was beyond one and zero.

431
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,775
His Majesty is on board!

432
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:54,574
I wished I could come back as a reserve,
but here I am, Captain.

433
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,159
I knew you would come like this.

434
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,201
I will be

435
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,830
the last crew member
to leave this ship today.

436
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,833
Please protect the sea of Corea.

437
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,294
The Navy of the Kingdom of Corea
wins before fighting.

438
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,588
I'm honored to have you fight with us.

439
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,508
This is the King's Flag.

440
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,762
Lieutenant Commander Han Jun-yeol.
I receive the King's Flag.

441
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,348
Attention!

442
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,977
Salute the King!

443
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,479
Salute!

444
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,702
And the Chinese government expresses
remorse that Japan has almost caused

445
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,120
the death of Chinese citizens

446
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,248
and escalated the situation
to the current standoff.

447
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,086
The Chinese government expressed
deep remorse that Japan

448
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,130
caused a confrontation which might
result in civilian casualties.

449
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,843
The anchor asked the reason for Japan's
provocation and the reporter is answering.

450
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,972
Your Highness, we will see
if there's an earlier flight.

451
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,682
Sounds good.

452
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,267
It could also be a strategy
to soothe the citizens

453
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,937
who are dissatisfied
with their economic policies.

454
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,377
They might've assumed
that a female Prime Minister

455
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,212
who doesn't have any knowledge of war

456
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,506
would choose negotiation
over confrontation.

457
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,134
I've always been the first to strike
when someone looks at me funny.

458
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,719
Prime Minister Mitsuda has made a mistake.

459
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,305
We have an ace in the hole.

460
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,103
His Majesty has boarded
the Yi Sun-sin Destroyer.

461
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,271
What?

462
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:49,772
But...

463
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,448
Current position:
Longitude 131.53 degrees east,

464
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,159
latitude 37.15 degrees north.

465
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,870
Distance to the enemy, 2,500 yards.
Direction, 20 degrees.

466
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,581
Distance to the enemy, 2,400 yards.
Direction, 20 degrees.

467
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,292
Distance to the enemy, 2,300 yards.
Direction, 20 degrees.

468
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,043
The weather doesn't seem good.

469
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,461
Wave height?

470
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,883
Currently, it's below one meter,
but it's rising quickly.

471
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,264
Captain, we might be able
to take advantage of the sea state.

472
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,269
We are going to win anyway,
so let's do it quickly.

473
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,981
Yes, Your Majesty.
The entire fleet is ready for action.

474
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:32,982
Good.

475
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,154
Hoist the King's Flag.
The entire fleet will go full speed ahead.

476
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,157
Full speed ahead to both sides.

477
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,826
Full speed ahead to both sides!

478
00:36:55,546 --> 00:37:00,468
General, all of the Corean ships
have started to maneuver.

479
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,095
Starboard observation report.

480
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,306
Direction, 270 degrees.

481
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,768
-We've located a flag on an enemy ship.
-A flag?

482
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,867
That's...

483
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,411
the Kingdom of Corea's King's Flag.

484
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:34,210
That King's Flag means
that the King himself is on the ship.

485
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,170
Report to headquarters.

486
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,463
Yes, sir.

487
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,217
Connect me to headquarters.

488
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,847
Sir, this is
the General of the First Fleet,

489
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,307
Omura.

490
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,311
We have been outfoxed
by the King of Corea.

491
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,729
Come to your senses.

492
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,982
This is not a crisis, but an opportunity.

493
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,651
Since their king is on board,

494
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,570
they will focus on their defense
instead of attacking.

495
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,157
Push your ships 1,000 yards into
the Kingdom of Corea's territorial waters.

496
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,743
Let the world watch

497
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,746
the King of Corea run away like a coward.

498
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,748
-Omura.
-Yes, sir.

499
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,586
All ships sail 1,000 yards into
the Kingdom of Corea's territorial waters.

500
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,172
All ships full speed ahead!

501
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,141
Dear God.

502
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,935
Please help us.

503
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,106
Please grant my Lord the fortune of war.

504
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,527
Please let my desperation
take the wind away,

505
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:46,490
and please let my prayer
bring victory to him on the waves.

506
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,201
Dear God.

507
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,495
Please help us.

508
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,334
Please grant my Lord the fortune of war.

509
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,588
Distance to the enemy, 1,500 yards.
Direction, 10 degrees.

510
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,715
Territorial waters violated by 700 yards.

511
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,925
We should have stopped
His Majesty at all cost.

512
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,054
The enemy is so close,
they are visible to the naked eye.

513
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,223
At this rate, we can't ensure
His Majesty's safety.

514
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,187
You invaded the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea.

515
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,981
Leave the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea.

516
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,441
I repeat.

517
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:25,154
Leave the territorial waters
of the Kingdom of Corea.

518
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,698
The enemy ships won't slow down,
Your Majesty.

519
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,367
It may be really dangerous from now on.

520
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,660
We must change our strategy
and focus on defense.

521
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,663
Captain Jo. Lieutenant Commander Han.

522
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,875
From now on,
I'm the only one who worries about me.

523
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,836
What you must protect today is not me,

524
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,214
but this sea.

525
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,840
Do you understand?

526
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,426
Yes, Your Majesty.

527
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:49,804
Action stations.

528
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,933
Speed Boat Fleet 203
will block them in the front.

529
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,144
We will press the Aegis
coming from the back.

530
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,771
Yes, Your Majesty.

531
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,732
Action stations.

532
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,818
Action stations.

533
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,153
Action stations!

534
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,321
Action stations!

535
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,572
Action stations!

536
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,074
Action stations!

537
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,119
Follow the enemy ships!

538
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,797
Full speed ahead to both sides.

539
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,216
We are ready to go full speed ahead.

540
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,551
To the enemy ships!

541
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,564
Flying Squadron Six, P-3C. Attack.

542
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,407
Activate the close-in weapon system.

543
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,492
-Activate the close-in weapon system!
-Your Majesty.

544
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,245
This might be seen as an attack.

545
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,915
Then it's a war.

546
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,336
Japan is in our territorial waters.
Warning shots are a generous response.

547
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,255
And it will be our last generous response.

548
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,509
I will listen to you, Major Choe.

549
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,470
Do you want to

550
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,847
stop me too?

551
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,226
I have been training men for 30 years
not to back off in situations like this.

552
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,145
Your wish is my command.

553
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,229
I will crush them.

554
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,399
I knew you would say that.

555
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,656
Get ready to shoot the Aegis
from 30 yards ahead.

556
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,247
Get ready to shoot the Aegis
from 30 yards ahead.

557
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,674
Fire

558
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,426
the warning shot.

559
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,898
Enemy ship,
Yi Sun-sin Destroyer at 800 yards.

560
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,692
Yi Sun-sin Destroyer, 700 yards.

561
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,069
Ship halted.

562
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,571
Captain! Guided missiles
have been detected.

563
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,576
The enemy ship's missiles
have aimed at our ship.

564
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,415
They plan to shoot us if we move.

565
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,796
The King of the Kingdom of Corea
is determined to go to war against us.

566
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,298
These are the Kingdom of Corea's
territorial waters.

567
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,634
Things are not...

568
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,595
looking good.

569
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,020
All ships stop maneuver.

570
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,109
Distance to the enemy, 700 yards.
Direction, 5 degrees.

571
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,944
The Japanese naval fleet stopped sailing.

572
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,699
It seems our message is well-conveyed.

573
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,617
Let's wait a bit.

574
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,077
But not too long.

575
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,449
IMAGINARY FLOWER

576
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,830
I bought it in that world.

577
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,958
It's made in the Kingdom of Corea.

578
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,888
I told you.

579
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,017
I told you there is no wind, no rain,
no sun, and no time here.

580
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,519
Flowers don't bloom here.

581
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,688
We don't know that

582
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,900
if no one has sown seeds yet.

583
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,923
I know you're from a different world,

584
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,133
but you should sprout.

585
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,099
Your friends are
in a much harsher place now.

586
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,939
IMAGINARY FLOWER

587
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,278
Currently at 7:40 a.m.,
the Japanese naval fleet

588
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,531
has completely left
our territorial waters.

589
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,535
I would like to extend my deep respect
to the soldiers and His Majesty

590
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,162
for fighting courageously for the country.

591
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:12,084
Japan will soon make an apology
and an announcement about compensation.

592
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,255
We will abide by international law
in the same circumstances

593
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,340
and fulfill our duties.

594
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,803
Until Japan's official apology,
the Kingdom of Corea will stop

595
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,931
exporting the rare-earth elements

596
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,641
to Japan.

597
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,030
The graph of your approval rating
looks amazing.

598
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,116
It's skyrocketing every minute.

599
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,369
The turbulence worked in my favor.

600
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,206
It has been unnecessarily peaceful.

601
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:55,711
If you had not become a Prime Minister,
you would have made a lot of issues...

602
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,214
-Why didn't you put on comfortable shoes?
-These are my combat shoes.

603
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,176
Have we heard from China yet?

604
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,677
Right.

605
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,930
It seems that they would like
to visit the palace first.

606
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,016
They are trying to set the date
with the Royal Court.

607
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,477
It seems that China is taking matters
about the visa with them.

608
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,229
What's with the priority?
Such talk should be done with me.

609
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,523
They should just send a panda
to the Royal Court.

610
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,028
It's not a panda,
but I have a present for you.

611
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,823
I won a court lady over
who works for the Royal Wardrobe.

612
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,533
I like the package.

613
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,122
It seems that there has been
a mysterious guest at the palace.

614
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,250
The security was strangely tight,
so no one has seen her face,

615
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,795
but it is assumed
that His Majesty brought her.

616
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,924
It's nice to meet you. I'm a big fan.

617
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,342
I saw her.

618
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,636
Pardon?

619
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,180
Congratulations. You were right.

620
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,516
She was young. I'm prettier, though.

621
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,812
Next week's state administration report
will be done personally.

622
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,815
And make sure to find something
about that woman before that.

623
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,570
The northern K Stadium created a big buzz
even before its construction.

624
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,447
As the first-ever dome stadium,

625
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,075
it is four stories tall
and has two basement levels,

626
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,868
with a seating capacity of 16,890...

627
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,413
K STADIUM

628
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,542
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

629
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,424
DOME STADIUM WITH 16,890 SEATS

630
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,845
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

631
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,815
From August 1st to 4th,
the Global Medical Center

632
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,235
will be developing a training program
for the health workforce in Thailand--

633
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,075
It's just the news.

634
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:55,414
Why on earth did he record the news
as a voicemail?

635
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,626
Gosh, it feels so refreshing
after the workout.

636
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,337
It really does. Are you all right?

637
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,297
Yes, I'm all right.

638
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,965
What now?

639
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,218
Why is she spacing out again?

640
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,597
Maybe she just checked
the physical fitness test schedule.

641
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,099
Tae-eul, did you check the schedule?

642
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,602
We have a physical fitness test next week.

643
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,688
I saw it.

644
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,440
Jangmi. You...

645
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,443
Have you ever searched for a person?

646
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:31,325
I have searched for run-away children,
fathers, housewives, and even dogs.

647
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,285
I specialize in run-away people.

648
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,495
Is she ignoring me right now?

649
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,622
Come on.

650
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,459
Hey, it seems like you think I forgot
about the Lee Sang-do case, but--

651
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,211
Let's put Lee Sang-do's wife
on the wanted list.

652
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,380
-Hey.
-Her children are young.

653
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,175
I'm sure she would like
to have them transferred.

654
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,676
I'll send an letter
to the Education Office

655
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,595
and stop by their office
before work tomorrow.

656
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,472
Look at you trying to get the head start.

657
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,224
The day after tomorrow is the due date.
Did you find the evidence?

658
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,643
I know it's the day.

659
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,645
It's a week
before the physical fitness test.

660
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,897
This is why you should always be ready.

661
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,482
Do you understand, Jangmi?

662
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,488
I will get going.

663
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,746
Is she a sociopath?

664
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,375
You will understand
once you become as old as us.

665
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,055
Should I have done this?

666
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,956
Try guessing what I just proved.

667
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,166
The fact that I've dated before?

668
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:04,793
Or...

669
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,795
that I'm dating right now?

670
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,594
Why won't you answer?

671
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,014
Do you want me to tell you?

672
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,600
You should keep it to yourself.

673
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,644
I'm dating right now.

674
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,732
Take off your clothes.

675
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,527
Is that your answer?

676
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,822
I didn't see this coming.

677
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,410
Do you have a strange scar
on your shoulder?

678
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,996
Who told you that?

679
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,582
Did you make that weird scar
on his shoulder too?

680
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,002
Eun-sup in your world is asking
if I made the scar.

681
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,673
It's not necessarily false.

682
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,259
I got the scar
from when I went to see you.

683
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,635
Not all of them.

684
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,554
Then tell me exactly how many.

685
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,639
You got me too excited.

686
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,599
Two.

687
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,773
That won't be enough to see my shoulders.

688
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,024
They are really broad.

689
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,820
Forget it. You can't see it now anyway.

690
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,656
Why? Is it luminous?

691
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,785
-If you're so curious, turn off the light.
-I'm not curious.

692
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,871
I just didn't want to take the blame.

693
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,748
Go now. I'm sleepy.

694
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,961
It's more difficult to cross this line...

695
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,094
than it is to cross universes.

696
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,014
Fine.

697
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,432
I will get going.

698
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,935
Make sure to sleep well.

699
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,365
Physiatrists and researchers

700
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:02,452
were dispatched to Sukhumvit in Thailand.

701
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,287
The head of the business,
Professor Lee Jong-in

702
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,665
says an efficient development
of a training program--

703
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,626
The head of the business,
Professor Lee Jong-in says--

704
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,003
Professor Lee Jong-in says--

705
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,382
Lee Jong-in, Prince Buyeong,

706
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,801
second in line to the throne.

707
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,679
King Haejong's nephew

708
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,306
and Prince Inpyeong's eldest son.

709
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,978
King Haejong's nephew...

710
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,063
King Haejong, my grandfather...

711
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,107
You use the term South and North Korea,

712
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,192
but in our world,
it's the southern and northern regions.

713
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,533
The northern K Stadium created a big buzz
even before its construction.

714
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,118
The northern K Stadium...

715
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,205
The northern...

716
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,750
The northern...

717
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,919
-King Haejong, my grandfather...
-The northern...

718
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,034
NOTES

719
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,581
All she really did
was search the internet.

720
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,917
She didn't leave anything behind.

721
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:34,794
Your Majesty,

722
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,589
please allow me to visit you for a second.

723
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,971
After your visit,
I found this at the Royal Wardrobe.

724
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,183
But there are many things
that I don't know.

725
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,811
I wasn't sure if this is something
that you lost

726
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,772
or not.

727
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,065
Leave it here.

728
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,566
It's mine.

729
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,571
So she did leave something.

730
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:07,911
I'm thanking you.

731
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:09,829
Have a good night.

732
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,999
I'm having a good night

733
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,835
thanks to you.

734
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

735
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,111
There you are.

736
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,948
I asked you to have dinner with me,
but you made me eat alone.

737
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,701
Rice with beans, spinach soup,
and spinach frittata.

738
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,744
You decided on the menu today, didn't you?

739
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,539
I have no appetite.

740
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,666
They say

741
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:58,837
there's a thief in the palace,
but I can't find that brat.

742
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,214
It's driving me crazy.

743
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:07,012
Anyway, did you finish all the food?

744
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,888
You told me to think of it as medicine.

745
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,225
When you're like this,
you're still a baby.

746
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,353
I don't understand
how you even go to the battlefield.

747
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,109
Will you now tell me

748
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,529
what you said you would tell me
or should I wait?

749
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,116
Did Uncle Buyeong

750
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,160
call?

751
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,913
He came back from the conference.

752
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,459
I called him and said
you came back to the palace safely.

753
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,753
Then he said, "That's good"
and hung up the phone.

754
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,883
You taste all my food,

755
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,344
examine every cloth,

756
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,056
every piece of furniture,
and every item that comes into the palace.

757
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,017
And you suspect every person
that enters the palace to protect me.

758
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,268
You also

759
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:59,105
hid the Manpasikjeok in the whip
and protected it.

760
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,858
May I ask why?

761
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,276
Well...

762
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:07,197
It's just what I had to do, Your Majesty.

763
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,909
What the traitor, Lee Lim,

764
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,245
tried to steal that night
was the Manpasikjeok.

765
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,206
So I had to protect it.

766
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,167
I had to hide it from him.

767
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:26,132
When Lee Lim's dead body was found,

768
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:30,678
the first thing I did was to look
for the other half of theÂ Manpasikjeok,

769
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,806
but I failed to find it.

770
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,727
I heard the corpse was drifting
in the sea for quite some time.

771
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,773
I told myself that it must have gone back
to the Dragon King of the East Sea,

772
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,818
just like the myth.

773
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,529
And it relieved me.

774
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,072
I'm also

775
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,950
relying on a myth.

776
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,120
That's why I'm waiting for Uncle Buyeong.

777
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,624
I'm not telling you the stories in detail

778
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,961
not because I want to hide it,
but because I don't know yet.

779
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,254
So I want you

780
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,214
to find the thief

781
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,967
while I look for something else.

782
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,428
Yes, Your Majesty.

783
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,139
I will find the thief.

784
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,480
There's no match to the fingerprint?

785
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,190
No. Nothing at all.

786
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,360
Does the fingerprint
belong to a foreigner?

787
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,655
Then...

788
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,619
Did you catch the woman called Luna?

789
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,913
Well, not yet.

790
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,208
Why is the Royal Court
looking for Luna, though?

791
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,919
It's confidential.
Please be understanding.

792
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,298
Did you get the CCTV footage
that I asked for?

793
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,966
Yes, I did. But...

794
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,970
I'm not sure if I can say
I have the footage or not, though.

795
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,889
It doesn't show anything interesting.

796
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,601
She seems to know
where exactly the CCTV cameras are.

797
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,728
None of them show her face.

798
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,772
Okay. I will call you back.

799
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,984
Please hold on.

800
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,823
Let me take a picture of you.

801
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,783
It's for security.

802
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,874
What just happened?

803
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,542
Tell me about it.

804
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,170
I'm sorry.

805
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,796
Why are you sorry?

806
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,966
Isn't my lipstick color weird now?

807
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,261
I think he's trying
to take pictures of me. Unbelievable.

808
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,387
I don't think so.

809
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,641
You don't know. That's what it is.

810
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,518
I think I know him better than you do.

811
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:42,977
I'm his uncle.

812
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,729
What?

813
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,243
Could you please zoom in Camera 21?

814
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,702
Okay.

815
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,801
Is one of these women Luna? Tell me which.

816
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,306
This is her.

817
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,850
This is Luna.

818
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,144
Goodness. Look.

819
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,189
Look how wealthy she looks now
after stealing others' money. Gosh.

820
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,899
Where is she now?

821
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,527
Tell me when you find her, okay?

822
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,614
You and I aren't too different.
We both use force to do our jobs.

823
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,242
You are the Royal Guard!
And I'm a gangster!

824
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,161
Are you out of your mind?

825
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,666
My world has just collapsed, you prick.

826
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,192
Yeong, is everything all right?

827
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,154
You came to work late today.

828
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,197
Everything is all right.

829
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,493
Should I come back later, Your Majesty?

830
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,162
That might be better.

831
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,834
Gosh.

832
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,170
My neck hurts.

833
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,881
I know something is up.

834
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,216
What is it?

835
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,057
What is this?

836
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,850
What strangled your wrist?

837
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,270
Is it the same kind of wound
as the one on your shoulder?

838
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,229
No.

839
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,814
This is not that.

840
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,192
This mark shows that

841
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,236
there's someone
who comes in and out of my heart.

842
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,864
It's kind of tight, though.

843
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,783
As if my heart is going to burst.

844
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,957
Your Majesty, Prince Buyeong
has just entered the palace.

845
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:12,960
Where is he now?

846
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,048
How was the conference?

847
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,425
It was a mess.

848
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,969
I couldn't focus on the presentation

849
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,223
because you were on the battlefield.

850
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,394
Please stay healthy.

851
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,272
You know you are the only one I have.

852
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:34,774
That's why

853
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,695
it's a very precious and sad life.

854
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,321
For me

855
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,781
and you.

856
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,368
That is why

857
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:49,664
I wished you would never ask me
about that incident.

858
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:51,833
But at the same time,

859
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:55,878
I knew you would ask me about it someday.

860
01:01:56,963 --> 01:02:00,425
About the traitor Lee Lim's
real cause of death.

861
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,558
This is the death certificate

862
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,643
where the real cause
of Prince Imperial Geum's death

863
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,603
is written.

864
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,533
Lee Lim was killed

865
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:31,080
not by the Royal Guards
but by the fracture of the cervical spine.

866
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,375
He got his neck broken
and then was thrown into the ocean.

867
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,419
How strange is that?

868
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:39,589
What's even stranger

869
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:44,802
was that Lee Lim was a man
with the body of a big warrior.

870
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,638
But the corpse we found

871
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:53,478
showed signs that it was born
with poliomyelitis.

872
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,688
Not to mention its appearance,

873
01:02:55,938 --> 01:03:02,111
its fingerprints and even blood type
matched with Lee Lim.

874
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,530
That odd corpse confused me,

875
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,658
and that is why I hid it from you.

876
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,082
You have been hiding it
for quite a long time.

877
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,085
It's not a minor crime

878
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,379
to lie about the death

879
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,340
of a traitor of the nation

880
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,303
and a high-profile criminal.

881
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,932
I know that, Your Majesty.

882
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:32,767
That's why

883
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,188
I have been feeling guilty my entire life.

884
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,983
I would like to free myself
from that guilt now.

885
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,447
If you ever find out the truth
behind that odd incident,

886
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,575
will you please tell me?

887
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,996
What truth could lay behind that body?

888
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,124
I have been curious about it
my whole life.

889
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,585
Although I do not deserve it,

890
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,004
I would like to know as a doctor.

891
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,732
Yes! Popsicles!

892
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,359
-Thank you.
-Eat it.

893
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,443
Yes, sir.

894
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,904
Yes! This one's my favorite.

895
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,950
-Leave it there. It's for someone else.
-Okay.

896
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,040
-There are popsicles in the fridge.
-Yes! Popsicles.

897
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,377
This one's my favorite.

898
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,879
But that's...

899
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,465
Jangmi, briefing.

900
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,884
Right.

901
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,220
I went to the Office of Education

902
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,015
and I found that Lee Sang-do's wife
didn't have her children transferred.

903
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,018
I checked if she changed the address
on her registration, but she didn't.

904
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,644
She's still registered in Seoul.

905
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,940
She will eventually have to
have them transferred.

906
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,191
She's a mother after all.

907
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,986
-Keep your eye on it.
-Yes, ma'am.

908
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,826
-Give me the big one.
-Goodness.

909
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,498
You know, other senior officers are happy
to see their juniors eat.

910
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,501
I'm not like that.

911
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,387
Did you find something
regarding the Lee Sang-do case?

912
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:38,893
Sin-jae,

913
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,145
do you trust me?

914
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,190
I do. What is it?

915
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,237
Now you say you trust me,
it's even harder to tell you.

916
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,324
I will tell you when things are clearer.

917
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,535
There's something,
but it's more like science fiction.

918
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,621
I will tell you when it becomes science.

919
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,807
Here's your milk tea.

920
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,102
Thank you.

921
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:24,063
You seem new.
Do you live in this neighborhood?

922
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,650
It's my first time here,
but I think I will visit more often.

923
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,569
I love this neighborhood.

924
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,197
It's lovely, right? Please come again.

925
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,741
It's quite rainy.

926
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,496
It seems that a typhoon is coming.

927
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,667
Be careful.

928
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,962
There are many typhoons in summer,

929
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,297
but typhoons in winter

930
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,300
cause the most damage.

931
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,452
What's wrong?

932
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,870
You should be careful.

933
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:24,832
I told you not to run!

934
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,877
Goodness,
I left the laundry outside to dry.

935
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,798
Seriously.

936
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,302
What's up, Kka-bi?

937
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,596
Did you not see the man's face?

938
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,556
It was so strange.

939
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,266
It was really scary.

940
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,019
What about his face?

941
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,729
Was he very ugly?

942
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:51,067
How could you not see it?
I'm the only one scared here.

943
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,861
He was like a monster.

944
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:58,824
Kka-bi, you shouldn't be like that
with others' faces. It's not right.

945
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,910
You never know
what will happen to your face later.

946
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:03,913
-How could you say that to a little boy?
-What?

947
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,956
Stop crying. I'm here for you.

948
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:07,708
I have got your back.

949
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,835
Good. I'm glad we have you. Let's go now.

950
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,378
It's pouring. Let's go inside.

951
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,840
What could have been
so weird about his face?

952
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,967
Let's go. Hey, wait up!

953
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,022
Head Court Lady Noh
had a good reason to worry.

954
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,232
I am

955
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,609
in danger now.

956
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:34,777
AUTOPSY REPORT
NAME: LEE LIM

957
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,654
Lee Lim, the traitor, is alive.

958
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,532
What had been added to Lee Lim

959
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,660
was the gate to the other world.

960
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,541
If the purpose of his treason
had been the Manpasikjeok,

961
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,504
since I have its other half,

962
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,215
he will definitely

963
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,969
come to me to retrieve it.

964
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,559
HERO TAEKWONDO CENTER

965
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,164
Have you

966
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,250
been doing well?

967
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:19,798
Have you been waiting for me?

968
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,414
Head Court Lady Noh was wrong.

969
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,919
Jeong Tae-eul is not a danger to me.

970
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:00,422
I am

971
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,384
a danger to Jeong Tae-eul.

972
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,428
Has something happened to you?
Were you threatened by someone?

973
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,138
I guess that means it will happen.

974
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,889
My heart is in need of consolation.

975
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,433
So I will hold your hand.

976
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,518
One of the doppelgangers
always ends up dying.

977
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,769
I will shoot him if you order me to.

978
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,147
We found the woman called Luna.

979
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,108
The same face exists.

980
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,194
Prince Imperial Geum.

981
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,572
I can't protect you here, Your Majesty.

982
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,865
He should know it already.

983
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:09,658
When you meet the person...

984
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,036
You must kill him as soon as you find him.

985
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:13,746
It's a King's order.

986
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,708
