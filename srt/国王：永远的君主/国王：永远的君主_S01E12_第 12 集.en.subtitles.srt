PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,073
EPISODE 12

4
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,661
Are you all right?

5
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,246
Yes, I'm fine.

6
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,166
I thought I just saw something.

7
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,089
Let go!

8
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,508
Let go of me, you jerk!

9
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,634
Let me go!

10
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,531
Get some sleep.
You'll be treated by the time you wake up.

11
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,539
You really are incredible.

12
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,500
You kill the living,

13
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,336
but you keep me alive
every time I try to die.

14
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,088
I guess

15
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,383
you'll really become a god.

16
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,445
I'll take care of the rest. Let her go.
Hang this up.

17
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,115
That cabinet will do.

18
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,791
Where is Mr. Yu when we need him?

19
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,085
He quit.

20
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,795
There's a new manager now.

21
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,630
She's Ms. Baek.

22
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,384
-A déjà vu?
-Yes.

23
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,680
A déjà vu occurs when your frequency
matches that of another world

24
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,141
and you get a glimpse
of yourself in that world.

25
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,393
You know that I used to be
in the radio club?

26
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,479
Why are you mentioning about it?

27
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,023
I saw myself just now.

28
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,068
But I was with someone
who looks exactly like you.

29
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,779
My doppelganger had short hair,

30
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,823
and yours was in a hospital gown.

31
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,118
A hospital gown?

32
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,672
Na-ri!

33
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,971
Right, you're injured.
So you could be delirious from a fever.

34
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,316
And this has happened twice already,
so I have to ask.

35
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,360
Who is Na-ri?

36
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,946
Why do people keep calling me Na-ri?

37
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,823
Myeong Seung-a, a newcomer
at Public Affairs.

38
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,493
We talk formally.
She's good at work and with words.

39
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,329
I meant ordinary,

40
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,373
not Na-ri.

41
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,460
I meant that I want to get better
and go back to my ordinary life.

42
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,588
Should I tell you how someone
who's a bad liar like you

43
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,924
can get out of a situation like this?

44
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,551
It's finally time

45
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,179
for you to ask for my number.

46
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,724
-It's 010--
-So it was you.

47
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,520
-The person he was talking about.
-She has pretty eyes.

48
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,690
Excuse me?

49
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,861
Hey, newbie.

50
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,407
Protect your phone number.
Don't give it out to other guys.

51
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,840
Damn, I thought I was going to get caught.

52
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
She looks exactly like Na-ri. Wow.

53
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,475
Even across different worlds,
she's still pretty...

54
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,149
Na-ri...

55
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,776
How are you--

56
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,282
Na-ri, Na-ri...

57
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:26,909
Jo Eun-sup...

58
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,412
He seems a bit strange these days.

59
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,333
Does he have another weird dream?

60
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,089
Hello, welcome.

61
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,678
Can I see the menu?
It's my first time here.

62
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,221
Here you go.

63
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,641
What's this?

64
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,895
It's the most popular milk tea.

65
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,648
There are chewy tapioca pearls
and soft pudding inside.

66
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,860
It sounds like a foreign language.

67
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,821
But it sounds interesting.
I'll have that to go.

68
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,824
It's 5,800 won.

69
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,328
Here.

70
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,206
Please wait a moment.

71
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,667
Hey, you're here. Hang on.

72
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,348
Eun-bi and Kka-bi aren't here yet.
Why did you come so early?

73
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,771
I want my japchae!

74
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,733
What are you talking about?

75
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,321
You told me to come get some japchae.
You said you'd give me some. Come on.

76
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,157
Here's your drink.

77
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,451
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,745
We're childhood friends.

79
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,288
I see.

80
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,464
It's good.

81
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,799
Come again.

82
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,470
Can't you see I have a customer?

83
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,640
And why did you cut your hair so short?

84
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,017
Let me borrow your car. The one out there.

85
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,103
Nonsense. You don't have a license.

86
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,273
DRIVER'S LICENSE
JO EUN-SUP

87
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,830
VIP escort vehicle is crossing
through Naegok.

88
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,166
It's heading for
the National Security Agency.

89
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,257
Hang in there, Lieutenant Jeong.

90
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm coming for you.

91
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,804
I promise

92
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,056
I will find you.

93
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,644
I want you all

94
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,398
to use big data to find the person
in this photo.

95
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,775
It's very urgent.

96
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,611
This isn't an order,

97
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,197
but a request.

98
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,240
-Yes!
-Yes!

99
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,701
Could I have the data?

100
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,580
It's a photo of a security footage,
so it's not very clear.

101
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,081
Could it still work?

102
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,542
Yes, it's possible.

103
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,795
But since we don't have
the exact location of the target,

104
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,255
it may take some time.

105
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,548
I understand.

106
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,340
Your Majesty, there's a call for you.

107
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,971
Yes, Yeong.

108
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,307
Sir, Detective Kang called again.

109
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,726
He said something about finding Luna.

110
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,646
They were chasing her
and causing a huge racket.

111
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,274
Tell him to call me right now.

112
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,442
And keep your voice low.

113
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,909
Is there a quiet room and a laptop
I could use?

114
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,745
I'll have them ready right away.

115
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,422
I checked the video.

116
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,507
It's near the Busan palace.

117
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,636
Yes. If you look at the 15th second
in the third file,

118
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,179
it's Luna for sure.

119
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,683
She's not the one you've been looking for,
but thank you.

120
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,602
Right... What?

121
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,688
Take care, then.
I'll thank you in person later.

122
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,360
I got info on the target's attire.

123
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,071
A grey hoodie, training pants,
and white sneakers.

124
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,989
She has her hair tied in a ponytail.

125
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,743
Check the routes from the Eastern Market
to the main palace.

126
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,938
TAE-EUL

127
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,481
SIN-JAE

128
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,943
Jo Eun-sup?

129
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,779
It's Jo Yeong.
Detective Jeong isn't picking up.

130
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,907
Please come to Yeouido. I need your help.

131
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,327
Do you have Eun-sup's phone?
What's going on?

132
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,539
-You'll have to owe me, though.
-I'll be waiting.

133
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,261
Go on

134
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,346
and get some rest.

135
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,058
-You've done a good job today.
-It's nothing.

136
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,619
Did you find out?

137
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,166
I hope it's news
that will put me back on my feet.

138
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,878
I checked the alibis of the workers
who changed their shifts.

139
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,089
There was nothing in particular
about Gi-yun, Do-gyeong, and Su-a.

140
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,717
So

141
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,803
there was something about Park Suk-jin?

142
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,976
She only went out twice recently
to a bookstore in the slums.

143
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,770
And the days she left were

144
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,189
when His Majesty's schedule was empty.

145
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,816
After she left the bookstore,

146
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,236
she was burning this.

147
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,118
And I'm reporting this to you today

148
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,623
because that bookstore was
where the traitor's henchmen were staying.

149
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,750
What?

150
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,797
How could someone like her
have worked here at the palace?

151
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,591
Hired as a national contributor's
descendant,

152
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,802
she was Park Dong-u's granddaughter.

153
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,805
But she was not his real granddaughter.

154
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,390
What are you talking about?

155
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,936
The real Park is living in Pyongan
under the name of Min Seon-yeong.

156
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,231
And there's a record of Min
having lost her son a long time ago.

157
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,236
What? Min Seon-yeong?

158
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,908
I was so thorough
when hiring workers in the palace,

159
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,244
but it was you!

160
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,791
What is your real name?

161
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,422
Are you Min Seon-yeong,
who lost a son a long time ago?

162
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,145
Keep your mouths shut!

163
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,188
If even a word

164
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,400
about this incident leaves the palace,

165
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,779
I will punish you and your family
for three generations!

166
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,948
-Yes, Lady Noh.
-Yes, Lady Noh.

167
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,246
Call the palace doctor.

168
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,082
And take her to the secondary palace.

169
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,127
We must keep her alive.

170
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,548
I have to find out and reveal

171
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,094
who tried to keep her mouth shut.

172
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,383
Hey!

173
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,302
Can't you drive properly?

174
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,137
I could've died!

175
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,892
You can't die here,

176
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,395
Prime Minister Koo.

177
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,024
Do I look like a government official?

178
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,819
I think you're mistaken.

179
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,739
-I don't think I am.
-You're mistaking me with someone else.

180
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,575
Why do you mistake me for someone else?

181
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,452
It's dangerous.

182
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,362
The police is here!
Over here! Someone's hurt! Hurry!

183
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,368
What was that gunshot?

184
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,371
Jo Yeong! Hey, stay with me! Hey!

185
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,086
This is a drill. You can go.

186
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,839
He's fine. It's a drill.

187
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,444
Are you sure you don't need a doctor?
The hospitals here are great.

188
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,530
Bullet-proof vests
from the Kingdom are great.

189
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,492
I don't have any fractures
or organ damages.

190
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,244
I only have a ruptured ligament,
so it's fine.

191
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,957
You don't see a doctor after being shot.
Where you come from?

192
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,462
I deleted the dashcam footage.
Give it back to Na-ri.

193
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,175
And be honest now.

194
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,678
What kind of country has shootouts
like that?

195
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,890
Explain yourself or give me an excuse.

196
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,391
Or you'll be arrested.

197
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,730
It won't happen again.
I'll explain when His Majesty returns.

198
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,399
When's he coming back?

199
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,321
I get this for saving you?

200
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,950
I can't use my hand. Can you open the lid?

201
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,079
You can get beheaded
for referring to the king like that.

202
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,712
He's your king, not mine.

203
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,096
Don't you remember?

204
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,265
He was your king,

205
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,809
and you saw him crying.

206
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,901
How long have you been a guard?

207
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,362
Since I was four.

208
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,615
Don't be ridiculous.

209
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,915
From now on, you're the Unbreakable Sword.

210
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,459
He was eight,

211
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,170
and I was four.

212
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,090
I saw His Majesty at his coronation.

213
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,638
That's when I thought

214
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,142
that I wanted him to be happy.

215
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,437
I think it was fate.

216
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,653
I don't know what to say.
It's such a different world from mine.

217
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,281
Are you two dating?

218
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,784
Rumors like that do exist.

219
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,705
But it's the same
for you and Lieutenant Jeong.

220
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,459
You protect the law and justice
with your lives.

221
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,503
For me, that's the king.

222
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,134
By the way, why was he crying then?

223
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,017
It was his first duty as the king.

224
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,270
The funeral of the former king.

225
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,234
So he doesn't have a father?
What happened?

226
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,319
He was killed by his brother.

227
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,864
And His Majesty saw it all.

228
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,076
So since then,

229
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,456
he has been sleeping
with the thought of death.

230
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,222
Protect her!

231
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,641
She is the future queen.

232
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,935
So the palace is the safest home for him,

233
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,896
and the most dangerous
battlefield as well.

234
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,110
But now it seems like
he has enetered a new battlefield.

235
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,238
If that is his destiny,

236
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,241
I must follow him,

237
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,078
whatever that battlefield may be.

238
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,175
Let me skip the thanks.

239
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,137
You're skipping so much.

240
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,518
I missed you.

241
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,230
I missed you.

242
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,818
I missed you.

243
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,577
And the gun.

244
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,539
There are two bullets left.

245
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,846
Let's go to the palace.

246
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,727
Jeong Tae-eul.

247
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,986
Sub-captain Seok.
Take care of things here, and Maximus too.

248
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,446
Yes, Your Majesty!

249
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,221
Your Majesty!

250
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,601
Dr. Hwang is here,
and I have a guest room ready.

251
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
No, I'm taking her to my chambers.

252
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,900
Bring Dr. Hwang to the king's chambers
right now.

253
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,311
Your Majesty! What happened?

254
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,814
Blood! My goodness.

255
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,527
It's not my blood.

256
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,444
What?

257
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,948
Are you all right?

258
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,541
Every woman I like is unwell.

259
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,147
My goodness.

260
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,817
Were you here the whole time?

261
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,278
You should've just come inside.

262
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,281
You told me to leave.

263
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,410
I've treated her wounds,

264
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,204
and she'll soon recover from dehydration.

265
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,959
She just fell asleep.
Why don't you go inside?

266
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,130
I should go
and get Dr. Hwang something to eat.

267
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,344
Thank you.

268
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,764
Thank you for your work.

269
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,770
This way, Dr. Hwang.

270
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,731
Oh, my head.

271
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,841
Get some more sleep.

272
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,011
You want me to sleep

273
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,598
when I've met you again at last?

274
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,063
I look awful, don't I?

275
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,233
Not at all.

276
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,070
You look like a huge bandage right now.

277
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,323
But you're a really pretty bandage.

278
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,244
But

279
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,539
how did you find me?

280
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,543
I told you I'm a decent person here.

281
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,843
I drank water at the Taekwondo center

282
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,763
and lost consciousness.

283
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,727
I now know the importance of food tasters.

284
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,857
You can tell me about it later.

285
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,695
You can tell me when you're all better.

286
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,284
I thought it would've been
our last moment together.

287
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,622
That time in the bamboo forest.

288
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,215
Lots of things

289
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,719
happened while we were apart.

290
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,597
That's why I couldn't go back.

291
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,227
That's a relief.

292
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,273
I thought that door had closed.

293
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,025
Don't worry.

294
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:25,365
If that door closes,
I'll open all the doors in the universe.

295
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,116
And

296
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,328
I'll come to you.

297
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,333
Please do.

298
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,507
But what about Eun-sup?

299
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:46,928
Well...

300
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,599
He's in the hospital.

301
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,476
He's all right, though.

302
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,271
Like I said, many things happened.

303
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,983
I see.

304
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,611
When I wake up,

305
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,533
let's go and see Eun-sup first.

306
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,452
I miss him.

307
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,330
Are you saying you miss another guy?

308
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,252
Jo Yeong is doing all right, too.

309
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,298
Yeong...

310
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,801
I like you more than Yeong.

311
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,386
That's such a lie.

312
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,762
Sorry.

313
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:33,892
It hurts.

314
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,021
What?

315
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,689
"Sorry"?

316
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,316
You opened your eyes.

317
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,238
I wanted to see your eyes again.

318
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,076
-Get out.
-This is my room.

319
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,244
Oh, really?

320
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,123
Then I should take a look around tomorrow.

321
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,878
I hope there's a lot of jewelry here.

322
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,933
JINSUN PARTY

323
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,146
His Majesty just caused a huge commotion.

324
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,733
It was shocking enough that he caught
the traitor's followers himself,

325
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,110
but announcing the queen?

326
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,237
Nobody imagined such things happening.

327
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,781
Announcing the queen
after so much blood was shed…

328
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,826
That's a very symbolic show of action.

329
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,788
We must find out
what kind of family that woman is from.

330
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,708
By the way, how long is Ms. Koo going
to stay cooped up?

331
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,794
The queen was announced,
and her approval ratings are falling.

332
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,630
All her efforts went to waste,
so no wonder she fell ill.

333
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,049
It'll be a headache
if an outsider gains power.

334
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,219
Even a prime minister from a fish shop
was a headache.

335
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,724
All right. We have to find out her age,
alma mater, family, job, anything.

336
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,668
CALL HISTORY

337
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,398
HOW TO RAISE A MAGIC LILY

338
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,196
JANGMI

339
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,576
Chief, what should I order for everyone?

340
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,745
I had a homemade meal.

341
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,539
Ox knee soup for me.

342
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,249
What about the other two?

343
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,920
One of you two read my message.
Can't you at least send a reply?

344
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,630
An exclamation mark is fine too.

345
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,758
I'll accept question marks too.

346
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,262
Crying face...

347
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,265
Mr. Kang, you're here.

348
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,184
Did you get my message?
I'm trying to order food.

349
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,979
You can eat first. What about Tae-eul?

350
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,147
What?

351
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,487
You don't know, either?
Tae-eul took a vacation.

352
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,114
What? A vacation?

353
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,950
Yes. She used all 21 days.

354
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,037
Why are you taking turns doing this to me?

355
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,876
-Hey. Your wild ideas...
-I'm getting some fresh air. Don't worry.

356
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,586
And your anxious eyes

357
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,005
are driving me crazy.

358
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,257
-This won't do.
-What should I do?

359
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,218
Let's have a team dinner today.
We can go singing later.

360
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,136
It'll be good.

361
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,388
-Where are you? Answer my call.
-My gosh.

362
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,532
I was removing your IV
as you're done with it.

363
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,078
Right. Thank you.

364
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,129
Nice to see you again.

365
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,505
Right.

366
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,968
His Majesty ordered me
to escort you once you wake up.

367
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,721
Oh, right. Thank you.

368
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,098
Where is he right now?

369
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,404
Is there something going on?

370
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:21,906
Well...

371
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:26,118
His Majesty is washing rice
in his navy uniform.

372
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,662
What?

373
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,467
You're awake. You should've come earlier.

374
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,136
I washed a whole bag of rice.

375
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,354
Where are you going?

376
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,357
I've been doing this for you to see.

377
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,235
Don't leave!

378
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,072
I can't feel my fingers now.

379
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:05,992
Hey.

380
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,163
-All right. Hurry it up then.
-What are we to do?

381
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,150
You said you'll only live for today.

382
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,695
I wanted you to laugh,
although I laughed more than you.

383
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,740
I couldn't leave because I was hungry.

384
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,867
How can you be so dramatic?

385
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,578
That's why I make such a great king.

386
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,957
If I take the MBTI personality test,
my type would be "the king."

387
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,544
Didn't I tell you I'm easily irritated
before meals?

388
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,796
All right. Enjoy your meal.

389
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,137
But it might not have been me.

390
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,766
What would you have done
if it was the other me?

391
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,147
I'm...

392
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,318
dating someone in another world.

393
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,155
And she always ties her hair
at important moments.

394
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,367
But she always leaves out some strands.

395
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,745
And she doesn't know it
because she can't see it herself.

396
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,457
And?

397
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,668
She prefers beer to tea
when having a conversation.

398
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,754
And she likes to mix drinks.

399
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,756
She mixes drinks seriously.

400
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,384
She shakes the glass excitedly,
and drinks it quickly.

401
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,428
But

402
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,933
when courage is needed,
she becomes a warrior.

403
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,519
She's like that.

404
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,734
Let's go see Eun-sup when I'm done eating.

405
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,490
But one big flaw is that she only says
what she wants to say

406
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,951
whether I make her food
or express my love to her.

407
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,623
By the way, are my clothes being washed?
They weren't in the room.

408
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,551
I got clothes that match your usual style.

409
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,219
Wear anything you want.

410
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,596
Why did you only get styles
I usually wear?

411
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,891
You could get different styles, too.
Don't you have any dresses?

412
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:37,977
They are over there.

413
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,321
I was kidding.

414
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,500
I'll wear this.

415
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,879
I knew you'd say that so I was showing off
all the pretty dresses I have.

416
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,360
What's that?

417
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,530
When do you wear that?

418
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,367
At the most glorious moment.

419
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:37,995
For example,

420
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,290
when I'm holding flowers in my hand?

421
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,292
What flowers do you like?

422
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,297
I just remembered

423
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,760
that I never gave you flowers before.

424
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:54,970
So

425
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,058
I crossed the universe.

426
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,937
I don't like flowers.

427
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,898
Let's go. I want to see Eun-sup.

428
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,612
Fine.

429
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,073
Show her the fitting room.

430
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,783
Yes.

431
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,786
This way, ma'am.

432
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:53,320
His Majesty said he'd like it
if you put on every item he's prepared.

433
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,738
All of it.

434
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,532
Didn't you find anything in your clothes?
Like a box.

435
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,285
It's a plum blossom, right?

436
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,203
It's really pretty.

437
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,748
It's so pretty

438
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,753
that I want to wear it
on a glorious day, too.

439
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,130
When I don't have any wounds.

440
00:43:55,924 --> 00:44:00,095
But how did you know I'd pick this outfit?

441
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,514
I know everything.

442
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,768
Let's go. Eun-sup will be waiting.

443
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,364
Captain Jo.

444
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:22,284
His Majesty will arrive soon.
He took the elevator downstairs.

445
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,746
All right. I'll do the security check.

446
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,804
He did the security check like this.

447
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,474
Eun-sup.

448
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:49,770
What?

449
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,314
Whose voice is this?

450
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,068
Tae-eul!

451
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,115
What's going on? Is this a dream?

452
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,825
Is it really you, Tae-eul?

453
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,538
How have you been?
I heard you were really courageous.

454
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,456
Listen carefully.

455
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,335
Someone was shooting at him,
and I could see the bullet flying.

456
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,753
So my instincts kicked in...

457
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,132
What happened to you, though?

458
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,550
You came here like this?

459
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,677
Something came up.

460
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,555
It looks like
you'll get a big promotion here.

461
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,515
Well, if I just put my mind to it,

462
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,767
a top rank position
will be a piece of cake.

463
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,603
What's that? Is that for me?

464
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,231
The roll cake you wanted.

465
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,611
I went to the Royal Bakery myself
and got it made just for you.

466
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,281
Wow, you really didn't have to.

467
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,453
All right. Cut me a large piece.

468
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,331
I'm afraid I can't do that.

469
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,917
But I could buy you the bakery
if you want.

470
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,421
Really? You better mean it.
I really respect you, sir.

471
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,675
I lost my chance
to have a canned peach company last time.

472
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,010
I was so upset.

473
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,929
Then next time,
ask him to open a car door for you.

474
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,728
Wow. Why didn't I think of that?

475
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,026
What is this?
How can this taste so luxurious?

476
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,987
Eun-bi and Kka-bi would love this
if they tried it.

477
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,242
Eun-bi and Kka-bi are eating well,

478
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,454
attending kindergarten well,
and they're bright.

479
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,625
And it seems like Eun-bi found out
Yeong isn't you.

480
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,836
Gosh, I told him to be careful.

481
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,589
Aren't you asking about Na-ri?

482
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,549
Na-ri?

483
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,552
Na-ri?

484
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,515
Oh, well.
I haven't thought about her at all...

485
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,185
-I don't miss--
-She's not getting along with Yeong.

486
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,938
-What?
-She says he's not as handsome as before.

487
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,274
I actually told him

488
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,444
that his style won't do.
I knew that would happen.

489
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,119
Sir, can you open
the bathroom door for me?

490
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,872
The spot where I got hit
is suddenly hurting.

491
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,210
This hospital is pretty huge.

492
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,841
What? No!

493
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:24,800
What's this?

494
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,511
Why are you doing that?

495
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,343
I guess the one who took me here
is Lee Lim.

496
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,262
Do you have any idea why?

497
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,472
Did you see

498
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,975
the umbrella that he was holding?

499
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,436
The umbrella?

500
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,440
I didn't actually see him.
I only saw his men.

501
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,317
I told you last time

502
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,237
that we each have a piece
of something we both want.

503
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,991
I think he hid it in his umbrella.

504
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:35,913
And me...

505
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,206
You hid it

506
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,167
in your whip.

507
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,545
He would've realized by now where mine is.

508
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,882
That's why he brought me here.

509
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,759
To make a deal.

510
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,761
So if you lose it,

511
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,348
the door closes on your side.

512
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,433
Yes.

513
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,603
So now the fight is about
who steals the other's piece first?

514
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,022
No. It's about not losing mine.

515
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,318
It's an all-or-nothing fight.

516
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,363
But you'd be at a disadvantage

517
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,450
in this fight.

518
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,537
You'd have to carry that

519
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,208
when you're visiting me.

520
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:26,421
That's why you shouldn't treat me harshly.

521
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:37,933
Don't worry.

522
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,852
I won't lose anything that belongs to me.

523
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,106
But if you're still worried,

524
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,608
why don't we go and pray?

525
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,236
Let's pray

526
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,656
for God's blessing on us.

527
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,672
I searched for this place in your world.

528
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,843
This church is the only place
that's the same in both worlds.

529
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,177
Really?

530
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,805
Why did you search for this church?

531
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,268
This is where my parents got married.

532
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:28,483
My father saw my mother
lecturing at a seminar

533
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,068
and fell in love at first sight.

534
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,529
It was the World Academy of Sciences.

535
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,490
My mother was a scientist.

536
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,368
So you take after your mother.

537
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,078
Yes.

538
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,248
My father proposed to her,

539
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,293
but my mother was Catholic.

540
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:52,049
So my father studied the religion
for six months.

541
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,927
He came here every single week.

542
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,305
Wow.

543
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,518
So they got married and had me.

544
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,316
But my mother passed away
three years later.

545
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,902
She had been frail from birth.

546
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,947
I don't remember it,

547
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,910
but everyone knows it,
and it's my first time sharing this.

548
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,582
But it's nice that you're the one
I'm telling this story to.

549
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,671
You've turned out great, Gon.

550
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,677
We skipped a lot of things.

551
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,018
When I was five,

552
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,189
my parents ran
the Taekwondo center together.

553
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,527
My mother was a really popular instructor.

554
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,695
But she died of cancer.

555
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,283
I'm still wearing

556
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,078
my mother's black belt.

557
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,586
You've turned out great,

558
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,588
Tae-eul.

559
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:19,719
Your Majesty?

560
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,392
Hello, Father.

561
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,568
I wasn't notified of your visit.

562
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,321
It's not an official schedule.
I was just passing by.

563
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,163
Are you good at keeping secrets,
by any chance?

564
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,414
Pardon?

565
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,878
God told me to set a guard over my mouth

566
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,380
and keep watch over the door of my lips.

567
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,302
Then would you take a photo for me?

568
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,974
I want a photo of us together.

569
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:11,980
All right.

570
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:47,265
"What is your reason for doing that?

571
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,479
You were sitting alone by the stream.

572
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,151
The green grass was sprouting

573
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,824
and the water was splashing
from the spring breeze.

574
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,998
You promised that even if you go,
you won't be gone forever.

575
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,544
That is what you promised.

576
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:23,093
I sit by the stream each day

577
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,847
and think about something endlessly.

578
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,229
When you promised that even if you go,
you won't be gone forever,

579
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,819
were you asking me not to forget you?"

580
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:36,750
It's all done.

581
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,461
The medicine is for three days,

582
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,755
and it contains antibiotics,
so no alcohol.

583
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,136
She asked about it...

584
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:58,688
Alcohol?

585
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,485
It's just for disinfection.
I was going to have just one glass.

586
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,697
It'll help with my blood circulation
and let me recover quickly.

587
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,991
I suddenly feel exhausted.

588
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,452
You should go. I'll get some sleep.

589
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,245
I told you that this is my room.

590
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,041
Oh, right.

591
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,630
Then where have you been sleeping?

592
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:27,842
Here.

593
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,761
Here?

594
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,429
How?

595
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,681
Next to you while you slept.

596
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,394
-It's a big bed, you know.
-Have you lost your mind?

597
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,188
No wonder.
People were giving me strange looks.

598
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,362
Don't overreact.
I didn't even hit you that hard.

599
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,659
My shoulder is hurting
like I've been burned.

600
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,704
The scar that Yeong mentioned.

601
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,084
Really? Let me see. Where is it?

602
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,618
What's wrong?

603
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,459
I think it's a side effect of crossing
the road of thunder and lightning.

604
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,463
What about you? Aren't you hurting?

605
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,715
No, I feel fine.

606
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,886
Look. Do I have a scar too?

607
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:53,970
Oh, you startled me.

608
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,016
You can see this much in the summer.

609
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,685
-Look properly.
-You're unbelievable.

610
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,564
This hurts even more.

611
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,862
You don't have one.

612
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:12,780
I don't?

613
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,076
Then is it a random thing?

614
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,037
It's strange.

615
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,082
This means it's not connected
to crossing the two worlds.

616
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,295
What about this?

617
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,132
The phrase we use when cursing bad people.

618
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,011
"I hope you get hit by lightning."

619
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,307
-I wanted to stop beheading people.
-Go ahead and try me.

620
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,230
Hey, that's--

621
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,528
I'm sure I told you

622
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,907
that you could be beheaded
for addressing me like that.

623
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,662
Stop being ridiculous.

624
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,043
Horrible weather, isn't it? I'm sorry.

625
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,296
It's fine. I didn't see you either.

626
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:43,843
Why?

627
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,137
Why?

628
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:52,351
Why are these cracks appearing
here and there?

629
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,687
Kill me.

630
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,941
Just kill me!

631
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,911
I didn't keep you alive

632
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,122
just to kill you like this.

633
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,417
You're the perfect bait.

634
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,171
That's why I've kept you alive.

635
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:25,176
If your son was alive,
would he have grown up like him?

636
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,263
You have the face

637
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,476
of my nephew's mother.

638
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,426
Welcome. Take a seat over there, please.

639
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,012
Can't I use the room?

640
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,182
The prime minister is using it right now.

641
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,061
You mean Seo-ryeong? Without any guards?

642
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,981
I want perilla seed noodles.

643
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,655
It's been a while.
I heard you were here alone.

644
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,992
-Can I sit?
-Whatever.

645
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:35,872
I heard you were sick.

646
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:37,874
Yes.

647
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,876
This is my first meal.

648
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,504
So let's not talk.
I don't want my food to get cold.

649
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,673
The seat isn't for you.

650
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,967
It's for the baby.

651
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,178
It must be a boy.
I'm eating so much these days.

652
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,764
I didn't check the gender.

653
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,266
It's a girl.

654
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:56,934
What?

655
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,478
Did you order?

656
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:02,231
It's coming soon.

657
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,485
I heard you're visiting the Middle East
with my husband.

658
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,616
I guess Mr. Yoon is a family man.
He talks about his work with you?

659
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,118
He's wasting his time.

660
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,998
Aren't you the icon of wasting time
these days?

661
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,293
It's too bad the four years
of effort is going to waste.

662
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,961
It seems you won't be the queen.

663
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,466
What do you mean?

664
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,468
You don't know?

665
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,346
Were you really that sick?

666
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,765
The king announced the future queen.

667
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,560
Let me use your phone.

668
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,027
You didn't even bring your phone?

669
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,657
KING ANNOUNCES FUTURE QUEEN

670
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,992
You should really serve another term.

671
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,037
Or else you'll really just become

672
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,124
a daughter of a fish shop owner.

673
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,339
Good luck with the baby.

674
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,967
Make sure to give birth
in this Kingdom.

675
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,474
What's she on about?

676
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,436
Yes. All right.

677
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,855
Keep that jerk's mouth shut.

678
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,901
Your Majesty, Lee Sang-do
is saying he's in pain.

679
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:29,819
Pain?

680
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:32,697
Yes, he feels burning
and it happens when it rains.

681
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:41,580
Your Majesty.

682
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,544
Prime Minister Koo
just entered the palace without a notice.

683
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,381
I guess she finally feels better.

684
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,508
Where is she right now?

685
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,565
You were sick for a while.

686
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,277
-Are you feeling all right?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

687
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:15,031
An unexpected piece of news
made me get up.

688
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,408
We'll go over that
once I'm done talking.

689
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,286
Prime Minister Koo.

690
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:22,747
You eventually pulled the gag.

691
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,207
What's your reason?

692
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,170
For tying me down, I mean.

693
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,047
If I hadn't tied you down,

694
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:34,550
where would you have gone?

695
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,345
To make a marriage proposal?

696
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:42,933
All right.

697
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:47,229
Let's talk about that first.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to talk.

698
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,528
Everything in the news is true.

699
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,156
She's

700
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,742
the woman I love.

701
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:05,289
I support her every step and every moment.

702
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,547
You're always so honest, Your Majesty.

703
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,117
It rains often since it's by the ocean.

704
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:43,911
That's the only downside.

705
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,455
Drink your tea.

706
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:59,927
I'm sure you would have felt upset
about how I treated you.

707
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:07,768
I hope you understand
that it was all to protect His Majesty.

708
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:10,813
It's all right.

709
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:18,195
I'm going to ask you something.

710
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:22,491
Can you answer me
without asking anything else?

711
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,203
And don't talk about this to anyone.

712
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,207
I'm willing to trust you

713
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,793
because you seem
to be a government official.

714
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,214
Go ahead.

715
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,680
My name is Noh Ok-nam.

716
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:52,646
My father is Noh Gi-seop,
my mother is Shin Jeong-ae,

717
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,815
and my sister is Noh Yeong-nam.

718
01:09:56,066 --> 01:10:00,571
I was born in 1932, in Pyoksong
of Hwanghae Province.

719
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,408
I left my hometown at the age of 17,

720
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:09,205
and I haven't heard any news of it
for 67 years.

721
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:11,707
So I want to ask...

722
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,715
What happened to that war?

723
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:27,389
The war that broke out in June, 1950.

724
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:20,234
His Majesty and Lieutenant Jeong…
The two worlds are too far apart.

725
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,903
What will you do?
Will you try to answer my question?

726
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,738
Is there even a way for us?

727
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,032
Stop acting so cocky and move.

728
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,409
Stop, Prime Minister Koo.

729
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:29,410
And if I stop you…

730
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:30,786
-Tae-eul.
-will you stay?

731
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,830
Should I tell you a secret before I die?

732
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:36,500
-I might find Lee Lim's bamboo forest.
-What are these cracks?

733
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:40,045
-My counterpart. Did you meet her?
-Should I stay just for today?

734
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,965
-We should see each other.
-If you see me now, you die.
