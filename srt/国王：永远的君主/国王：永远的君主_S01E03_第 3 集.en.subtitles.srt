00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,230
EPISODE 3

2
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,000
SIN-JAE...

3
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,766
She should tell us if she'll be late.
She's making us wait.

4
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,478
Good parts like drumsticks and wings

5
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,980
should be eaten
while they're crispy on the outside.

6
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,859
Sin-jae, just drink with Eun-sup today.

7
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,945
I have something to take care of.

8
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,115
Eat up. She says she can't come.

9
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,119
One bottle of soju, please.

10
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,663
Hang on.

11
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,998
Tae-eul really refused chicken and beer?

12
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,337
What's going on? That's unbelievable.

13
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,675
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

14
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,095
I take you

15
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,097
to be my wife, the Queen.

16
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,891
You just became the reason.

17
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,312
The reason
why I should stay in this world.

18
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,609
Did you say "queen"? Why?

19
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,779
Did I look cool over the last few days?

20
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,824
You've gone so mad
that your brain turned 360 degrees.

21
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,870
If it's about the angle of rotation,
a 360-degree means its original position.

22
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,664
Oh, right. It should've been 180 degrees.

23
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,291
So?

24
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,042
Are you saying you mean it?

25
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,128
I've just given you a whole world.

26
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,215
I don't know
how I can be any more sincere.

27
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,426
Oh, I just received a whole world.

28
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,761
Right, I guess that's a good item

29
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,472
to be giving on the street
while going to eat chicken.

30
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,391
Are you crazy?

31
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,566
Among real numbers, zero is my favorite.

32
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,610
You have the nature of that number.

33
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,196
Do I? Who would have known?

34
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,990
Usually, a zero means
that there is nothing,

35
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,784
but it's actually a number
of absolute power.

36
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,622
It can nullify any number
or take everything away from it.

37
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,458
What makes money powerful
is not the number at the front,

38
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,251
but the number of zeros behind it.

39
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,840
A number trapped in a root symbol
can escape under only two circumstances.

40
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,762
They need to have a square root
or meet the powerful number, zero.

41
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,350
You're always busy,
and you don't care much for me.

42
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,436
Because of you, I'm powerless here,

43
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,605
but it's fine.

44
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,235
You are much more amazing
than I had imagined.

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,031
And you're standing in front
of the root symbol I'm trapped in.

46
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,662
You asked if I meant it. That's my answer.

47
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,789
Believe me now?

48
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,250
Believe what?

49
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,838
I was asking if you really mean
to keep talking nonsense.

50
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,510
You're as slow-witted

51
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,137
-as a bear.
-A bear?

52
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,890
A bear?

53
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,893
Are you insulting me
since you have nothing to say?

54
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,481
Would it be okay for a king
to marry some random bear?

55
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,816
They'd oppose that.

56
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,486
The court and the cabinet
would all oppose strongly.

57
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,031
All right, let's go. Let's go there.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,367
Take me to the parallel universe of yours.

59
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,953
I'll go and proclaim myself
the mother of the people.

60
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,955
Lead the way. Which way is it?

61
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,957
Come on, lead the way.

62
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,817
What is it?

63
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,945
Is this the wrong doorway to your world?

64
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,575
If you have to recite a spell, do it.
No need to feel embarrassed.

65
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,368
I'm looking for it.

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,747
But it's not opening
since I came empty-handed.

67
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,292
I guess we should've brought something.

68
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,252
Are you kidding me?

69
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:42,467
I know it's hard to believe,
but there should be two obelisks there.

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,178
Your lies are getting detailed.

71
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,473
You mean the rocks in temples?

72
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,810
Yes. They stand between the world of gods
and humans.

73
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,315
I heard a flute,
then came thunder and lightning,

74
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,984
and two large obelisks appeared.

75
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,781
I guess I'm not allowed
to use that door today.

76
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,290
Are you bored or something?

77
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,336
Why did you come here
when you're not allowed?

78
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,962
I needed to check once,

79
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,966
but you told me to lead the way,
so it was a good opportunity.

80
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,512
What did I do to deserve this?

81
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,349
Why am I talking such nonsense with him
when it's freezing cold?

82
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,810
Mr. Kim Gae-ddong.

83
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,979
Listen carefully.

84
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,983
Your DNA results will probably come out
by tomorrow.

85
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,153
It'll be a relief
if we find your relative,

86
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,947
but even if we don't,

87
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,741
this is as much as I can do to help.

88
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,829
And stop calling Eun-sup. Got that?

89
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,955
Did he agree to that?

90
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,999
He's government property,
so he doesn't have a free will.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,336
Would Eun-sup and Yeong
really have the same DNA?

92
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,506
Even twins don't have the exact same DNA.

93
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,844
So even if you find a relative,
they won't be my real family.

94
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,974
Why would a relative not be your family?

95
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,979
My mother and father passed away
a long time ago.

96
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,940
The first duty of a king

97
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,359
is carrying out the funeral
of the former king.

98
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,319
It was when I was eight.

99
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,373
That's a long time ago.
Shall we go now?

100
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,674
What's his name?

101
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,761
You're an only child
but call him your brother.

102
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,680
What's your name, then?

103
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,308
Why ask when you don't even know yours?

104
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,604
I never said I don't know.
You just can't say it even if I tell you.

105
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,192
-Are you the poet Kim So-wol?
-Who's Kim So-wol?

106
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,861
You're really good at pretending.

107
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,325
I won't "finish the last words
I had in my heart,"

108
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,577
so stop being nosy about my life.

109
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,753
Is that guy really a huge part
of your life?

110
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,672
Hey!

111
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,058
The five tenets of Taekwondo are

112
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,853
courtesy, perseverance, integrity,
self-control, and indomitable spirit.

113
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,773
For people without black belts,
it'd be Taeguk 1 to 8.

114
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,568
For people with black belts,
it'd be from Koryo to Ilyeo.

115
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,986
You're the Taekwondo master?

116
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,573
As you can see, the road of learning
is a long and rough unpaved road.

117
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,241
But there is no need to worry.

118
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,159
I'll accompany you to the end,

119
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,245
so you'll show courtesy,
have perseverance,

120
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,039
integrity, and self-control,
and have an indomitable spirit.

121
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,292
-Is that belt real?
-Talk politely.

122
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,168
JEONG TAE-EUL

123
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,255
Is this perseverance?

124
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,093
Don't lower your guard either.

125
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,096
You're the one who needs
to learn perseverance, not me.

126
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,142
It'll be a waste of money
to just lie there.

127
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,603
Get up. You will learn breakfalls first.

128
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,479
Let's just skip that.

129
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,441
I fell thousands of times before.

130
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,444
And you'll keep falling in the future,

131
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,280
so I'll teach you how to fall safely.

132
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,260
Hey.

133
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,221
Hey, that's prejudice.

134
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,224
I just look a bit rough.
I'm not a bad person.

135
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,522
They were talking about you.

136
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,858
You really are handsome.

137
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,195
You don't have an ID, do you?

138
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,781
Hey.

139
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,699
Are you trying to attack me?

140
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,950
Your resume states

141
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,537
that your family is living
in Canada right now.

142
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,915
-Is your family wealthy?
-Pardon?

143
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,460
Oh, well...

144
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,629
We didn't have any financial trouble.

145
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,382
Then you won't do anything stupid
over money.

146
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,551
Do you have many friends?

147
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,720
It hasn't been long
since I came from Canada.

148
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,639
I only have one childhood friend
that I meet often.

149
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,350
Then you're forced to be reticent.

150
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,146
The reason why I'm hiring you is--

151
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,439
What?

152
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:12,857
I got the job?

153
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,942
So suddenly?

154
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,736
It's not sudden.

155
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:21,449
You've applied for four years,
and I've watched you for four years.

156
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,494
You've been watching me?

157
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,582
-How?
-Nickname Jogon Jogon.

158
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,668
I've enjoyed your fanfics.

159
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,714
I was happy
living in the world you created.

160
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:42,595
I appreciate your ability
to create something from nothing,

161
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,848
so I will give you an important job.

162
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,894
Are you familiar with After Effects
and Photoshop?

163
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,103
Wow, that's crazy.

164
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,483
Sorry about that.

165
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,569
I got a spot for you
at the Royal Public Affairs Office.

166
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,241
I want you to just write like you used to.

167
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,913
Please write beautiful stories
and touching hashtags.

168
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:32,812
HIS MAJESTY IS GROOMING
HANDSOMENESS STILL SHOWS THROUGH THE MASK

169
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,232
Head Court Lady Noh is working hard.

170
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,070
Prime Minister,

171
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,614
are you honest?

172
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,952
Honesty is a privilege
that only the king can have

173
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,163
since he doesn't need to care
about approval ratings.

174
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,290
But I'm a politician.

175
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,919
I thank you on behalf of all the citizens

176
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,088
for voluntarily deciding to pay taxes.

177
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,925
But as a politician,
I'm planning on using your honesty--

178
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,554
I heard you vetoed the salary raise
of the Congress members.

179
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,057
Do you think you can win?

180
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,435
Am I going to be the Joker in that fight?

181
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,646
Don't you know what card you are?

182
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,065
You're always the King, of course.

183
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,609
I'll do my best to win.

184
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,486
Just watch me.

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,197
I've been watching.

186
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,450
He said he'd watch, but he ran off?

187
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,953
-Pardon?
-Is everyone attending today?

188
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,454
Oh, yes.

189
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,665
Since it's an important agenda,

190
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,877
even those on a business trip
returned this morning.

191
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,463
They only work hard
when their money is on the line.

192
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,178
It's the first time in three years
that a salary raise has been mentioned

193
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,640
since the discussion
at the last cabinet meeting.

194
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,893
Living expenses have risen since then,

195
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,395
and it's natural to raise a salary
based on that.

196
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,022
But a veto?

197
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,315
My goodness.

198
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,902
Aren't you a member of our party,
Prime Minister?

199
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,612
Prime Minister,

200
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,824
are you trying
to use our well-earned money

201
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,328
to maintain your own approval ratings?

202
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,372
I really didn't want to say this,

203
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:20,210
but don't you think that position
is too much for you?

204
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:27,092
I mean, the party helped you
gain that position

205
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,387
by creating a favorable image for you.

206
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,933
But all you're doing
is putting on more makeup.

207
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:40,147
Mr. Park, if this position can be kept
by dressing up and putting on makeup,

208
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,942
then you can do the same as well.

209
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,276
Look here, Prime Minister!

210
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,236
COREA PARTY

211
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,658
His Majesty has been paying taxes
voluntarily since last year.

212
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,161
Don't you think
we should improve our image?

213
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,038
There are articles out every day

214
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,208
about the increasing gap
between high earners like politicians

215
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,751
and low earners.

216
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,296
Of course, postponing the raise
just once won't narrow the gap.

217
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,924
But we can show the citizens

218
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,887
that our party's values
are clearly centered around them.

219
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,183
If you understand
why our party's approval rating is so low,

220
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,687
please explain it
to the people next to you.

221
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,355
Don't keep it to yourself.

222
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
And one more thing.

223
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,158
I'm the Prime Minister.
Not the representative of a party.

224
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,175
My mouth feels...

225
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,302
My mouth feels so fresh.

226
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,345
Chief.

227
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,140
What is it?

228
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,560
I just heard that they're seizing
Sin-jae's salary again.

229
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,477
Again?

230
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,064
You didn't tell him that, did you?

231
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,026
No. If I wanted to,
I would've gone to the office right away.

232
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,278
-Why am I here to tell you about it?
-Good job.

233
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,698
Do you think his mother
still hasn't quit gambling?

234
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,116
This is unbelievable!

235
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,953
His mother grew up a bit spoiled
in a wealthy environment.

236
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,621
She has no knowledge of the world.

237
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,416
People enjoy gambling
even when they weren't spoiled.

238
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,001
It's so irritating.

239
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,503
What do we do about poor Sin-jae?

240
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,971
This is the list of junk dealers
in Eunpyeong, Seodaemun, and Jung-gu.

241
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,351
I asked around in Seongbuk, Dongdaemun,
and Seongdong-gu, but there was nothing.

242
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,646
Do I really have to investigate this
at my rank?

243
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,357
When are we getting a new recruit?

244
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,317
This morning.

245
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,027
It's the afternoon.

246
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,864
The sun's down already.

247
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:58,202
I mean, he came to work real early,
so I sent him to Squad Two to help--

248
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,913
Wow.

249
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,875
Is that our new recruit
who just caught a criminal?

250
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,531
You look well-built. Nice.

251
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,617
It's nice to see you, newbie.
Tell us your name.

252
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,535
Yes!

253
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,620
I'm Jang Michael.

254
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,372
Sit down, sir.

255
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,333
And answer the detective's questions
properly.

256
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,919
He's the detective.

257
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,422
Hello!

258
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,884
I'm Jang Michael, and I'll be working
with you starting today.

259
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,347
It was my dream to wear
a handcuff with a criminal I caught.

260
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,351
I won't do it again.

261
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,811
Right, once is enough.

262
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,439
Is there another dream you have?
Even if you do, don't ever mention it.

263
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,607
Yes, sir.

264
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,525
But you...

265
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,486
-What's your name again?
-It's Jang Michael.

266
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,532
It's my baptismal name.
Just call me Jangmi.

267
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
My friends all call me that.

268
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,620
Jangmi, as in "rose"? Wow.

269
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,914
I'll send you the manual,
so tell me your email.

270
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,832
Yes, sir.

271
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,125
It's rose93...

272
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,505
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean...

273
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:40,220
We weren't shocked
at your English skills, you know.

274
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,016
-"Rose"?
-I was actually shocked at 93.

275
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,559
Okay, just continue.

276
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,810
Yes, sir.

277
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,272
It's rose93@unicorn.net!

278
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,151
I will do my best
with passion and a sense of duty!

279
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,819
I'm happy to be on the team!

280
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,363
Wow, look at you.

281
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,700
"Passion and sense of duty"?
That's overwhelming.

282
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,411
Let's get rid of one.
It'll exhaust you, too.

283
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,123
Copy that list
and follow your seniors with passion.

284
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,292
-Yes, sir!
-You can drive a manual, right?

285
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,251
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,670
I was born in 1993, so...

287
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,548
Okay, I'll drive since I was born in 1987.

288
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,550
I'll drive, I was born in 1990.

289
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,115
A crowbar? You can look around.

290
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,452
You can find scrap metal on the right.

291
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,163
There are some crowbars there.

292
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,457
Is the weapon a crowbar this time?

293
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,960
The world is so scary these days.

294
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,046
You're lucky.

295
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,299
I didn't get enough scrap metal,
so I couldn't sell them.

296
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,676
You can dig around.

297
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,346
Let's go.

298
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,695
Ms. Jeong! Mr. Kang!

299
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,781
I found it! I think I found it!

300
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,865
What?

301
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,036
The blood.

302
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,414
This is it, right?

303
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,749
-I think it is.
-Are you a shaman or what?

304
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,003
Hand it over to the Forensics team.
You two wrap this up.

305
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,046
What do you mean? You should join us.

306
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,257
What would this rookie know?

307
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,385
-You're telling me to do everything.
-I guess you understood, then.

308
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,512
Good luck.

309
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,390
Where are you going?
Are you receiving a bribe or what?

310
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,143
It's too bad that such a fine tradition
is disappearing.

311
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,187
I really like your jokes.

312
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,608
"Jokes"? We weren't joking.

313
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,071
Why? You only take your salary
and nothing else?

314
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,409
Take him.

315
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,662
Take him!
He believes everything he's told!

316
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,289
What should I do with you?

317
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,300
I picked this up on my way here.
Nobody saw me.

318
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,929
If we pick up money, we should give it
to the police. Detective Kang,

319
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,932
please find the owner.

320
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,268
Wait, maybe you're the owner.

321
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,650
I did a background check on you
the last few days.

322
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,320
Your family was rich,
but went bankrupt when you were 15.

323
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,280
You are drowning in debt.

324
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,242
Right, I lived in an upscale neighborhood.
Why? Are you jealous?

325
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,871
Of course. I lived in Area B
of the Youth Detention Center.

326
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,958
But I guess I'm better off now.

327
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,876
How?

328
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,253
Do you own a house?

329
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,798
Then I'd be jealous
because I live on rent.

330
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,633
I'm really curious, though.

331
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,219
Why do you live so honestly?

332
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,179
Well, aren't you being a curious George?

333
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,224
I don't live honestly.

334
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,020
Somebody once told me to be someone
standing at the edge of the wrong path.

335
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,564
-So I'm living like this, okay?
-Wow.

336
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,900
That's so touching.

337
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,572
Then you should earn lots of money.
The government doesn't give you this much.

338
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,617
I'm not asking for much.

339
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:35,038
Just give me a call before any crackdowns,
and let us off a little if we get caught.

340
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,290
It's a win-win--

341
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,668
Can a cop beat civilians like this?

342
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,628
Don't you know what it's like these days?

343
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,673
Call the police if you want.
And I got hired ages ago.

344
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,800
-You little...
-Hey, it's fine.

345
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,348
Why don't you calm down and--

346
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,393
You asshole, you chose the wrong guy.

347
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,690
You better be here at the next crackdown.

348
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,775
And make sure I catch you,

349
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,279
so I can get promoted, all right?

350
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,885
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

351
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:35,307
-Taekwondo! Concentration!
-Taekwondo! Concentration!

352
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,934
Everyone, gather round. Roll call.

353
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:38,852
Yang Seo-jun.

354
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,520
-Here!
-Here!

355
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,771
Jeong Si-ho.

356
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,856
-Here!
-Here!

357
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,526
All right, answer just once,
shortly and politely.

358
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,653
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Jeong Seo-yun.

359
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,238
-Here!
-Here!

360
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,115
Jeong Ji-min.

361
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,116
-Here!
-Here!

362
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,118
Rock, paper, scissors.

363
00:24:55,202 --> 00:25:00,540
The five tenets of Taekwondo
are courtesy, perseverance, integrity...

364
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,500
Hey!

365
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,376
Be quiet, you little jerks!

366
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:09,591
You should listen to your master
when he's talking! You little punks!

367
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,306
Why are you crying?

368
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,311
Stop crying!

369
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,147
Cut it out!

370
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,736
KANG SIN-JAE

371
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,074
Hey, Sin-jae.

372
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,244
You...

373
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,873
You should stop teaching the kids.

374
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,669
-Why?
-They said they're scared of you.

375
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,172
They go home all excited
and never come back.

376
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,550
Kids these days
don't have any perseverance.

377
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,594
You punk! You're the one
who should have perseverance!

378
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,471
My goodness.

379
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,265
You can't do this to me.

380
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,850
You promised to keep me off the streets
for my money.

381
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,353
How will I make a living
if you kick me out like this?

382
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,105
All I can do is become a gangster.

383
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,900
If I do, I'll take tons of money
for the building maintenance fees,

384
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,652
so think carefully.

385
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,281
Why weren't you so good with words
in front of the kids?

386
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,199
I'll be better tomorrow.

387
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,702
I can lead kids on the right path, too.

388
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,662
I'll get someone else to do the leading,

389
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,372
so do something else.

390
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,041
Why don't you become someone

391
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,713
on the edge of the wrong path?

392
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,184
POLICE EXAM PREPARATION BOOK

393
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,236
I handed the weapon over to forensics.
I was really nervous.

394
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,329
The Forensics team just called.

395
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,664
-You left your phone there.
-Really?

396
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,792
I bought it yesterday. Oh, no...

397
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,756
My gosh, Jangmi.

398
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,883
Can you handle this important task?

399
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,720
What you're going to do now

400
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,307
is the most important job
our team's rookie needs to do.

401
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,559
-Is it a case?
-It'll be if you fail to do this.

402
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,521
Organize activity bills
and write up work reports.

403
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,650
The overtime payments
of your seniors depend on you now.

404
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,819
So with your passion, record each second.
Pick up your pen.

405
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,737
Right!

406
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,825
Use a black pen, Jangmi.

407
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,119
Black!

408
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,627
This is Violent Crimes Division Three,
Lieutenant Jeong.

409
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,129
It's me. I guess you're still at work.

410
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,465
-It's a relief.
-Kim Gae-ddong?

411
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,343
No wonder why my cellphone
was quiet today.

412
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,723
How did you find out
the direct line to my office desk?

413
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,016
Eun-sup.

414
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,601
-Jangmi!
-Yes?

415
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,019
Bring Jo Eun-sup here.

416
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,022
In handcuffs.
You can beat him up if he refuses.

417
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,299
Hey.

418
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:42,053
-Eun-sup?
-Wow, it's broken.

419
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,222
Gosh, it can't even live up to its worth.

420
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,683
Don't even talk to me.

421
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,561
I'm not getting involved with you anymore.

422
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,021
It's great.

423
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,776
Hey,

424
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,696
what did you say to get me handcuffed?

425
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,490
All I said was "Eun-sup."

426
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,201
I told you to keep it a secret.

427
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,370
How can you be so cheap?

428
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,416
You might not know it,
but nothing I have is cheap.

429
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,918
So as an apology,

430
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,671
I'm appointing you chief
of the Royal Guard in this world.

431
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,300
You're the Unbreakable Sword now.
It's a very honorable position.

432
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,888
-You're crazy.
-"Crazy"?

433
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,977
I must take you back to my world with me.

434
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,729
You'll be beheaded.

435
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,731
Yeah, sure.

436
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,902
I don't have a head, so I'll skip my bow.

437
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,576
Yeong.

438
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,496
Head Court Lady Noh.

439
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,753
Since the King hasn't appeared,
there are rumors about him being ill.

440
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,965
They will soon start
writing speculative articles.

441
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,051
We are in trouble now.

442
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,763
He won't come out of his study
and won't let anyone in or out.

443
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,059
I'm feeling so heavy with worries.

444
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,686
I have a solution.

445
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,774
We can cloud the issue in times like this.

446
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,654
Where is the Jo Yeong,
the Chief of the Royal Guards?

447
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,293
-What are you doing here?
-Work.

448
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,046
Give me your phone, unlocked.

449
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:45,343
Head Court Lady Noh told you
to cooperate with me, right?

450
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,480
-Do you have SNS?
-I don't.

451
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,692
I knew it. I was just checking
for any hidden accounts.

452
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,610
I'll check your photo album.

453
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,242
I guess you came to work
with your father's phone.

454
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,743
It's my phone.

455
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,662
I know. I'm making fun of you.

456
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:15,999
Amazing.

457
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,918
I'm going to use this photo.

458
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,553
BUSAN, THE CULTURAL CAPITAL

459
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,812
-Jo Yeong's account?
-Don't impersonate him.

460
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,355
Gon Jo couple is official now.

461
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,441
I thought it would never happen.

462
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,004
JEONG TAE-EUL

463
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,049
Find out everything you can about her.

464
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,885
And of course, this is a secret.

465
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,220
Isn't she

466
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,557
the woman from the ID card
His Majesty had?

467
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,143
How do you know that?

468
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,563
I already investigated her three years ago
under His Majesty's orders.

469
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,692
I looked through all database,
but such a person didn't exist.

470
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,821
And as you would've seen,
the issue date is strange, too.

471
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,989
It could be fake.

472
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,618
I'm getting a headache.
And it breaks my heart.

473
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,536
I told him not to,

474
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,165
but I guess he never gave up.

475
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,210
The woman he was chasing,

476
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,797
could it have been this woman?

477
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,426
How can there be nothing?

478
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,096
There aren't any immigration records,
either.

479
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,639
Don't worry.

480
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,558
That woman isn't His Majesty's style.

481
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,812
She won't even get along well with him.

482
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,189
You can tell she's not a science person.

483
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,358
And you,

484
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,152
do you know what your style is?

485
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,700
Oh, my head.

486
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,618
Oh, my heart.

487
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,288
The number you have called--

488
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,046
The number you have called
is unavailable--

489
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,715
SIN-JAE

490
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,384
Detective Jeong!

491
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,221
Oh, Officer Yoon.
Did you get the DNA results?

492
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,973
Yes.

493
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,436
But there aren't any matches,
even in the missing persons database.

494
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,731
Nothing?

495
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,150
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

496
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,193
You said he doesn't even have ID.

497
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,864
How can there really be nothing?
I've never seen such a person.

498
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,948
Damn it. Hang on.

499
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,996
This is Lieutenant Jeong.

500
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,123
This is the Korea Racing Authority.

501
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,459
I'm contacting you
about the document you sent us.

502
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,087
Could we take a look
at the horse you were asking about?

503
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,800
So is it a stolen horse?

504
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,803
No, it wasn't stolen at all.

505
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,182
It's a rare breed
from a Spanish descendant,

506
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,726
so we can't find it in Korea right now.

507
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,772
We're curious
about how that horse is here.

508
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,444
Hello? Lieutenant Jeong?

509
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,125
Let's talk after I drink a glass.
I really need alcohol right now.

510
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,129
But why are you mixing
two kinds of alcohol?

511
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,472
It's not just mixing.
It makes a new drink.

512
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,474
You've never seen this before?

513
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,895
Why? Your horse is of Spanish descendant,
but you've never seen this?

514
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,272
Don't you have soju and beer
in your world?

515
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,316
-We have.
-Then why don't you mix them?

516
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,235
Don't you know MSD?

517
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,946
You know MSD?

518
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,906
It's the joy of life.

519
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,332
Bottoms up for the King.

520
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,130
-Why are you laughing?
-The MSD you know and the MSD I know

521
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,714
are so different.

522
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,927
And once again, I never drink anything
that hasn't been tasted beforehand.

523
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,306
Are you really from another world?

524
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,100
I told you but you didn't believe me.

525
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,354
Who's allowed to use that door?

526
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,109
I'm not sure yet,

527
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,195
but someone besides me might have used it.

528
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,114
-Who's that?
-I can only tell you

529
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,991
-if you become part of my family.
-Gosh.

530
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,202
-Stop making things up.
-You should know, though.

531
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,788
If I make up something,
then that becomes the law.

532
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,206
You should know this.

533
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,001
If I give you a punch,
then that becomes a bruise.

534
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,086
-What a liberal arts person.
-Right.

535
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,548
We come up with ideas
and the science guys make them a reality.

536
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,675
But I don't think
you can do either of them.

537
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,761
You said it's a parallel universe.
But why is the capital Busan?

538
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,764
It's the cultural capital.
The central government is in Seoul,

539
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,434
the politicial capital.
Pyongyang is the economic capital.

540
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,186
You call it South and North Korea,

541
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,396
but we call it the southern
and northern region.

542
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,609
And the King and Queen stay
in the main palace in Busan.

543
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,361
-In case you're curious.
-That's nonsense.

544
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,531
Why would the King stay
in Busan and not Seoul?

545
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,074
I'm not curious.

546
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,999
Since 1592,
we've had a political conflict with Japan.

547
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,918
We're always at the brink of war.

548
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,795
So my grandfather, King Haejong,

549
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,632
announced a constitutional monarchy
in 1945,

550
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,677
leaving the parliament in Seoul
and moving the palace to Busan.

551
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,182
It was to show the royal court's pledge
to stand at the front

552
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,683
to face our enemies first.

553
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,812
That's why the statue
of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin is in Busan.

554
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,941
The statue shows

555
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,153
that no one can cross our Kingdom's seas
and invade our Kingdom.

556
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,409
I see your novel is going well.

557
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,789
You got nothing on my DNA results.

558
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,042
But you still can't really believe me,

559
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,294
right?

560
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,925
So who do you think I am?

561
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,971
There is no information at all
about me in this world.

562
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,438
I hope your earth

563
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,817
can become round soon.

564
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:15,960
I'm going to use the bathroom and pay,
so you can head out first.

565
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,151
What is...

566
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,331
No wonder.

567
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,916
I thought it was too expensive.

568
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,252
When did you get that?

569
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,670
Before you came back,

570
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,591
the owner asked if I needed anything else,
so I answered yes.

571
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,011
I nearly got fooled.

572
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,389
A King? And the stuff about the capital?

573
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,184
You're a total nutjob.

574
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,811
This is so ridiculous.

575
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,105
I've missed you for 25 years--

576
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,066
-Shut up!
-You'll be beheaded for that.

577
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,859
You're so full of yourself.

578
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,321
Just keep working on your novel.

579
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,698
My gosh.

580
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,542
Why are you following me?

581
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,378
I'm not following you.

582
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,881
I'm going to say goodnight to Maximus.

583
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,444
But why won't it eat the carrots I give?

584
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,239
Do Senior 7th Rank officials
only eat freshly picked food?

585
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,199
Did you taste it beforehand?

586
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,335
Why didn't you eat the carrots
she gave you?

587
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,339
Eat them from now on.
At least keep it in your mouth.

588
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,344
That's a king's order.

589
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,496
What?

590
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,917
-Why do I always look at this?
-Yes.

591
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,379
Prince Buyeong performed the autopsy.

592
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,925
The fingerprints and DNA
all matched with traitor Lee Lim.

593
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,887
I know. I know that, but...

594
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,265
The body is like Lee Lim,

595
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,185
but it's like an unknown symbol
that's not him.

596
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,023
Sometimes, symbols of math or science

597
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,151
are useful when understanding
a certain phenomenon.

598
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,030
For example, the plus sign
is meaningless on its own.

599
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,450
It's a symbol that signifies
the adding of subjects.

600
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,244
So my hypothesis is

601
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,625
that this body is a symbol
that Lee Lim used

602
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,544
to show that he died.

603
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,006
But then comes a bigger question.

604
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,800
What is this body,

605
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,845
and how does it have the same DNA?

606
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,474
What was added

607
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,728
to the real traitor Lee Lim?

608
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,067
Where are you?

609
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,029
What has been

610
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,032
added to you, Your Majesty?

611
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,908
I told you to just pretend.

612
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,576
Don't actually sell food here.

613
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,913
Careful what you say.

614
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,581
Those kids have ears too.

615
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:31,919
Hey, kids.

616
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,129
Move. That's my seat.

617
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,715
If you sit here,
you can become a Prime Minister.

618
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,760
I succeeded because it was me.

619
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,345
I even went to the palace before.

620
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,305
That woman goes there every day.

621
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,516
She's the King's girlfriend.

622
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,267
Right?

623
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,020
You can stay, and you go home.

624
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,983
Stop babysitting kids.
You're taking care of all the kids.

625
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,697
My gosh.

626
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:05,619
You can play here and go home
when your mom gets back.

627
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,704
-Okay.
-Okay.

628
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,460
Mom, I want pollack soup.

629
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,713
And I want it spicy.

630
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,093
What about the men outside?
Are they joining you?

631
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,012
Just Mr. Kim.

632
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,016
The security team takes turns eating,
so don't mind them.

633
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,437
What's that?

634
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:35,441
Oh, a customer left it here.
They might come back to get it.

635
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,778
-Get some sleep. I'll wake you up later.
-Okay.

636
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:05,220
RELICS EXHIBITION
KINGDOM OF COREA

637
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,361
I hope your earth

638
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,239
can become round soon.

639
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:43,926
What's going on?

640
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,803
The tank is full.

641
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,434
I should turn off the engine first.
Stay calm.

642
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,201
This is Hero Taekwondo Academy.

643
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,621
-Hello?
-Is that you?

644
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:15,833
Why...

645
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,502
Why is Kim Gae-ddong answering--

646
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,464
What?

647
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,642
-Did you just hang up on me?
-You did that often to me.

648
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,019
Don't you dare.

649
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,938
Why are you there?

650
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,066
I was here the whole time
since I came to this world.

651
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,943
You just didn't know it.

652
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,406
-Let me talk to my father.
-Your father is in a meeting.

653
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,619
Your father gave me coffee,
and he even tasted it for me.

654
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,664
What do you need? I'll tell him later.

655
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,419
I'm... in front of the supermarket,

656
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,422
but my car just stopped.

657
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,967
I need him to watch my car
until someone comes to fix it.

658
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,468
I can take a taxi.

659
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,179
What state is your car in?

660
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,017
If I tell you, would you know...

661
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,519
Oh, I guess you might.

662
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,187
You're a science guy, right?

663
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,981
What should I do?

664
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,900
-Answer my questions first.
-Okay.

665
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,068
-Did you change your engine oil?
-Of course.

666
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,446
And the fuel filter
that's replaced every 20,000km?

667
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:34,870
What's that?

668
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,830
-What stuff do you have?
-Hang on.

669
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,003
A bottle of water, wet towels...

670
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,674
Beef jerky and a hair tie.

671
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,970
-Then take the hair tie and water.
-Okay.

672
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,306
-Hang on.
-Tie your hair and open up the bonnet.

673
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,852
-And...
-Yes?

674
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,482
Drink that water while you wait.
I'll be there.

675
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,275
Are you kidding me?

676
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,028
Good cars stop like that
to protect their engines.

677
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,782
That means there's nothing you can do.
I'll be there soon.

678
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,158
Just hang on.

679
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,803
Someone will come in ten minutes
to fix the car.

680
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,638
So just watch my car until then.

681
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,432
Don't touch anything. You...

682
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,853
Gosh, it feels like...

683
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,267
I'm leaving my kid in danger.

684
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,569
So take care of it
like you take care of Maximus.

685
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,406
This thing is a Senior Fifth Rank to me,
okay?

686
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,035
Time stopped for a bit just now.

687
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:21,953
Didn't you feel it?

688
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,624
Why would time stop?

689
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,877
-Did you decide to get weirder?
-Everything stopped except for me.

690
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,170
Why not you?

691
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:36,259
It's a theory, but I think it might be
a side effect of using that door.

692
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,430
But thanks to that,

693
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,016
I saw something beautiful.

694
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,478
Okay, enjoy yourself.

695
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,980
And please watch my car too.

696
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,108
Bye.

697
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,832
I unintentionally got a car.

698
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,221
EOSU BOOKSTORE

699
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,208
THE KING LEFT THE PALACE

700
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,045
Your Highness.

701
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,967
It's been a long time.

702
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,428
The world is peaceful,

703
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,307
so I couldn't feel the time passing by.

704
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,852
I guess there are many customers
in the book shop.

705
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,481
Yes, they always come at the agreed time.

706
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,253
On that day...

707
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,548
I should've realized it once I found out

708
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,009
that Manpasikjeok is the key.

709
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,307
That traitor Lee Lim
has the other half of it.

710
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,269
And that he is probably alive

711
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,981
moving back and forth
from the two parallel worlds.

712
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,109
I should have known

713
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,823
before I had laid my eyes
on this beautiful thing.

714
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,786
I should've known that it is the key

715
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,664
and the lock.

716
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,919
Have you all been well?

717
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,380
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

718
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,805
Listen up.

719
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,228
We got the results
from the Forensics team.

720
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,817
They found the blood of both the killer
and the victim on the crowbar.

721
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,652
We can finish up this case.

722
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,363
Sin-jae,
you write the investigation report.

723
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,906
Good job.

724
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,200
-Great job.
-Thank you, sir.

725
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,454
"Good job"? That's it?

726
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,165
-We should have an after-work party today.
-My gosh.

727
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,708
But Chief...

728
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,126
-Oh, please.
-Oh, please.

729
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,629
Kim Bok-man is strongly denying it,

730
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,883
but everything's adding up perfectly.
Don't you think so?

731
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,428
Among the guys
who strongly denied their crimes,

732
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,721
nobody was innocent.

733
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,723
They all killed someone and denied it.

734
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,267
-We have the weapon and a clear motive.
-Right.

735
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,144
And the victim's body was in his trunk.

736
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,522
Which out of those three is bothering you?

737
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,485
I'm not saying there's something specific.

738
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,529
It feels like someone planned all this.

739
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:08,782
My gosh.

740
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,377
Why are you looking at me?
She's looking at me.

741
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,549
Buzz, buzz. 2019 Kang Sin-jae.
Is it the same over there?

742
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,928
Do you have after-work parties
without investigating everything?

743
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:34,307
It's been 20 years,
so I guess some things would've changed.

744
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,059
It's Jin-woong from Signal!

745
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,229
She's talking nonsense to me,
and he keeps playing along.

746
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,814
You little... Hey.

747
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,400
You little...

748
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:45,902
Good job.

749
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,812
The number you have called
is unavailable--

750
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,064
The victim's wife isn't picking up.

751
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,608
I guess she ran away from the loan sharks.

752
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,069
Are you going to dig more?

753
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,155
Kim Bok-man is garbage anyway.

754
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,032
We can put him behind bars for longer,
so why do all that?

755
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,661
A detective shouldn't talk like that.
You came with me anyway

756
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,621
to make sure he isn't falsely accused.

757
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,040
I'm only making sure
you don't feel wronged.

758
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,837
If you'll dig more,
trust the evidence we found.

759
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,133
If it really was planned by someone,
that evidence will point to something.

760
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,681
I doubt it'll have anything useful
but check this.

761
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,150
Wow, 2019 Kang Sin-jae.

762
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,863
Hey, Kang Sin-jae from 11th grade,
Class 3, Number 5!

763
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,953
What's going on today?

764
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,539
The past keeps calling me today.

765
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:30,173
It's been such a long time.
Has it been three years?

766
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,384
What are you doing in the hood?

767
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,471
Was he your teacher?

768
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,723
No, my old classmate.

769
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,559
You should go. He might kill me.

770
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,354
I sent him to jail three years ago.

771
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,901
Your friend must've succeeded
after getting released from jail.

772
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,653
He has a large group.

773
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,405
Yeah, and I only have you.

774
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,368
Sometimes I think I should've just stayed
on that path.

775
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,620
You can rely on me.

776
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,667
You're in Violent Crimes Squad Three now.

777
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,672
Hey, misters.

778
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,259
You can't just jaywalk like that.

779
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,761
Your girlfriend?

780
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,056
Oh, she's a detective.

781
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,685
Female detectives are so scary these days.

782
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:27,021
Maybe I should change my job.
Should I become a househusband?

783
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,818
-You two have some nerve coming here.
-It's three.

784
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,738
Hey! How did you get here?

785
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,283
By car. Your Senior Fifth Rank official.

786
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,952
-It was pretty speedy.
-What?

787
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,665
We'll talk about that later.

788
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,585
So how are you going to do this?

789
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,587
Are you three teaming up?

790
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,258
I'm just going to watch.
The officers can take care of it.

791
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,093
Why are you confusing us?

792
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:02,181
Guys, make sure to beat up Number 5
Kang Sin-jae from Class 3 properly.

793
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,725
I owe him a lot.

794
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,589
Why did you become a cop?

795
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,841
It's dangerous to be a cop.

796
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,512
Not everyone in the world can be brave.

797
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,307
So I decided to become brave.

798
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,199
Hey! Get this jerk first!

799
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,040
You shouldn't do that.

800
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,376
I hate it

801
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:13,961
when people touch me.

802
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,902
I told you, didn't I? I worked out a lot.

803
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,322
-I'm glad I was able to prove it.
-Are you kidding me?

804
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,950
Are you mad? You drove?
Do you even have a license?

805
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,493
The King doesn't have a license.

806
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,371
-I'm the one who issues--
-You crazy...

807
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,250
How did you come here?

808
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,585
I went to the station to see you,

809
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,213
and they said you were out.
I looked at your GPS

810
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,257
and this place was looked up
a few times.

811
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,719
It's a relief I met you here.
I nearly had to go to the forensics.

812
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,556
Over here.

813
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,730
I got some stuff.
Put on a bandage while we eat.

814
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,314
So we meet again.

815
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,610
Are you feeling all right?
It looked like you got beat up badly.

816
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,905
What are you doing here?
You seemed to be on their side.

817
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,407
What's with the two of you?

818
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,743
Let's continue after we eat.

819
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,746
Why didn't you buy the good ones?

820
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,539
Some are even waterproof these days.

821
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,499
Those are too expensive.

822
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,586
And why did you only get one?

823
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,171
The bigger one is mine.

824
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,257
Try to divide it equally.
Don't think about eating the bigger half.

825
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,676
You could've just bought two.
There are two people.

826
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,388
It's actually three.

827
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,118
-I'll pay for this.
-No, I will. Head out first.

828
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,036
Mister.

829
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:11,788
Pay for mine.

830
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,373
I need that hospitality more than her.

831
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,836
You really are a funny dude.

832
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,506
He really doesn't hold grudges.

833
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,008
He doesn't keep anything to himself.

834
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,137
I'll head out first.
Come with me. Where's my car?

835
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,890
Head to the station. And you wait for me.

836
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,517
Come with me.

837
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,605
Did you enjoy it?

838
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,107
Come out. Hurry.

839
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,571
Are you going to be late today?

840
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,577
-Why are you asking?
-I should say goodbye.

841
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,247
I don't want to wait if you are.

842
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,375
Where are you going?

843
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,210
Back to my world.

844
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,589
I'm the King there.
I left the palace empty for too long.

845
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:08,219
And you didn't share that ice cream
with me.

846
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,807
You said it's a parallel universe.

847
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,603
You sound like you're making a short trip.
Did you finally remember the spell?

848
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,648
It's not that I didn't know
how to go back.

849
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,568
I just didn't want to go.

850
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,116
All right, then.
Goodbye. I'm gonna be late.

851
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,809
I'll pay you back next time. Bye.

852
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,149
That horse is yours, right?

853
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,613
Which company made this harness?
Give me their number.

854
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,656
That's an interesting question.

855
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,200
Why? Is it nice?

856
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,744
What's the company?

857
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,830
I don't know.
I was never curious about it.

858
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,125
And you won't be able to reach them
even if I knew.

859
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,460
Stop the nonsense.

860
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,090
What logo is this?
I'm asking because I saw it before.

861
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,343
-Where?
-You better be honest.

862
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,761
I didn't see it at a party.

863
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,388
Wherever you think you saw it,
you're mistaken.

864
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,557
That logo is used

865
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,393
in a country in another world.
It's not used here.

866
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,022
Oh, really?

867
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,650
How do you know about it?

868
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,860
I'm the King of that country.

869
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,990
He's a liberal arts person too.

870
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,245
How long will it take to analyze this?
It's urgent.

871
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,790
Extremely urgent.

872
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,667
Everything is urgent here.

873
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,003
-It'll take two weeks minimum.
-Wait, this is--

874
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:09,006
Everything here is about murder,
robbery, and assault.

875
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:12,218
I truly mean it.

876
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,638
I have a family.

877
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,057
I work 13 hours a day.

878
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:20,559
Don't rush me.

879
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:26,857
Good luck.

880
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,905
What? You lent him money? How much?

881
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,032
I told you. 2,007,560 won.

882
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:38,202
He needed to check out of
the hotel, but he was missing that much.

883
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,663
Do you sleep on a pile of cash?

884
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:45,251
That guy didn't even have 7,560 won
to pay himself.

885
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,877
How could you lend him that much?

886
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:50,715
He has even strides, great pronunciation,
and is good with words.

887
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,050
You can't achieve that
with just any education.

888
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,387
I'm sure he's wealthy.
He'll pay me back double the amount.

889
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,890
My gosh. Where is he right now?

890
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,810
He would've gone back to his world.
He said he was going home.

891
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,563
What?

892
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:11,152
He said he's the King of his country.
He left the palace empty for too long.

893
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,946
He'll stop by somewhere and head home.

894
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,727

SELECTED POEMS OF KIM SO-WOL

895
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,504
"Oh, shattered name.

896
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,799
Oh, the name that parted in the air.

897
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,178
Oh, the name without an owner.

898
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,641
The name I will die calling.

899
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,853
I could not finish the last words.

900
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:32,942
I had in my heart.

901
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,847
The one I loved."

902
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:05,891
"The one

903
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,477
I loved."

904
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,545
The King finally came out of his study.

905
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,839
Where did you go to this time?

906
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,675
My nephew finally found...

907
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,637
The time stopped. It's the second time.

908
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,181
What's wrong with you?

909
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,517
Mom, please.

910
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,727
I should've gone straight to his bedroom.

911
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,689
I don't want to hurt you.
But my words will be hurtful.

912
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,065
Do it until he wants to die.

913
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,235
Where were you?

914
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:24,280
Don't be surprised
by what's about to happen.

915
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,365
No way...

916
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,868
