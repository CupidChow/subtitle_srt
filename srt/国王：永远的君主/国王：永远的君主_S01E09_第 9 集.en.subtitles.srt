ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,982
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,612
EPISODE 9

4
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,033
This is the right address.

5
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,369
I think it was set here on purpose.

6
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,707
If she's being this thorough about hiding,
it'll take some time to find her.

7
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,335
This made me confirm two things.

8
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,088
One, Song Jeong-hye is with Lee Lim.

9
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,759
Two, even though it's work,
it's nice to go somewhere far with you.

10
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,511
Wherever it is.

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,516
Do you get tutored
to learn phrases like that?

12
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,352
Actually, I taught myself.

13
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,772
This is why everyone...

14
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,402
Everyone commits treason?

15
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,655
Are you mad?

16
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,616
Do you think this is okay?

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,661
I mean, it's why everyone
in the palace loves you.

18
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,163
You know how to joke
in difficult situations.

19
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,501
We should've gotten here sooner.
We don't have much time.

20
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,711
That's what I was thinking.

21
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,633
You thought of a lot of things
in a short time.

22
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,887
-Why would you make such joke?
-It's a joke only I can make.

23
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,016
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you'd be so startled.

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,355
I don't even know how to comfort you.

25
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,817
There's a person I like,

26
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,362
but his past is so dramatic.
He's a victim of treason.

27
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,952
Your earth is still flat.

28
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,789
Yes, it's as flat as a thin pancake.

29
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,885
I guess you were troubled

30
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,262
since Song Jeong-hye

31
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,392
will have the face of my mother, right?

32
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,774
I thought that maybe you'd want
to see her.

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,612
Not at all.

34
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,115
Like how Yeong and Eun-sup are
different,

35
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,243
she is not my mother either.

36
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,206
The face is just a symbol of a person.

37
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,251
Then let me ask one thing.

38
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,423
How do you go back and forth
between the two worlds?

39
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,759
Both you and Lee Lim.

40
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,936
I've answered all your questions
until now, and I will continue to do so.

41
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,481
Except for that question you just asked.

42
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,444
All right.

43
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,157
Then is it true
that it's your first time dating?

44
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,450
That's an exception too.

45
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,953
Shall we go now?

46
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,497
It's suddenly getting cold, right?

47
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,375
We say that men should always keep
their word.

48
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,252
Don't you say that in your world?

49
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,170
Oh, do you say that here?

50
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,761
Who's the girl you made
steak and rice for?

51
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,848
-I thought you had one question.
-You didn't even answer one.

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,186
I attended the Naval Academy.
You're the only woman in my life.

53
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,814
You have quite a wit.

54
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,025
I see that you don't.

55
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,702
You looked good in the navy uniform.

56
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,829
Why are we holding hands?

57
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,999
Did you make steak and rice
for Seo-ryeong too?

58
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,584
You didn't prepare
the rice in that uniform, did you?

59
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,344
I barely made it on time.

60
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,848
Listen carefully, and keep this in mind.

61
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,226
I eat bread from this bakery
every morning.

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,354
The bread here tastes like the bread
at the Royal Court.

63
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,441
Why would I need to keep that in mind?

64
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,032
I'm a busy person.
Why did you bring me here?

65
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,451
You spread the jam thoroughly
for a busy person.

66
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,495
Bread should be eaten with jam.
So why am I here?

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,419
Keep in mind that it tastes great
without jam as well.

68
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,255
And what I'm about to say
is even more important.

69
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,675
From now on,

70
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,845
you must be the real Unbreakable Sword.

71
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,432
You must've lost your mind.

72
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,018
Can you turn around?

73
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,229
It looks like Yeong's coat.

74
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,106
100 percent cashmere.

75
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,569
The Unbreakable Sword?

76
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,405
I will do as you order.

77
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,408
I didn't want to brag about myself,

78
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,661
but I'm actually skilled
at dealing with problems at the office.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,288
What should I do first?

80
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,669
You're here. Did you eat dinner?

81
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,340
I sent you a lot of clothes.
Why did you come wearing that?

82
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,092
Don't waste your money.

83
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,220
I never wore them
even when we had rich in-laws.

84
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,596
That was a long time ago.

85
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,973
You're true.

86
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,185
I brought some boiled fish.

87
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,106
Why don't you have just one bite with me?

88
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,358
How can I eat at this hour?

89
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,948
Just one bite, then.

90
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,372
But Mom.
You really didn't send me that newspaper?

91
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,999
It's salty. Eat that with rice.

92
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,129
And I really didn't send it.
What kind of newspaper was it?

93
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:03,881
Never mind.

94
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,261
I guess my secretary made a mistake.
Lots of stuff get sent to my office.

95
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,057
-Is everything okay at home?
-It's always the same, you know.

96
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,270
By the way,

97
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,730
about that dead Lee Lim...

98
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,651
Did he have a hidden child?

99
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,820
Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,948
He died after he committed treason
without an heir.

101
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:29,907
Right?

102
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,537
But the customer who left the umbrella
at the store

103
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,747
came to get it a few days ago.

104
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,751
He looked just like Lee Lim
when he was alive.

105
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,839
So I thought maybe he had a son.

106
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,218
Mom, you'll get in huge trouble
if you say things like that.

107
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,139
The king doesn't have an heir yet.
A bastard of the traitor?

108
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,061
If you spread rumors like that,
it'll be the end of me.

109
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,522
Your daughter is the prime minister.

110
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,234
I'm going to go and change.

111
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,194
All right.

112
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,116
I didn't tell anyone.
You're the only one I told.

113
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,827
I really won't tell anyone.

114
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,095
YEONGSIN DRAGON SEES HOPE
FOR THE FALL BASEBALL SEASON

115
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,039
Stay right here, okay?

116
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,291
I'll come back soon.

117
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,132
I'll be back soon, okay?

118
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,760
It's the 6th day
of the former king's funeral.

119
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,931
After his coronation, King Lee Gon
began his first duty as king,

120
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,059
mourning his father's death for 26 days
according to court laws.

121
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,686
Father...

122
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,773
The public is watching
the young king's formality

123
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,944
-with a sad heart.
-Father...

124
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,863
Father...

125
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,366
A black plum blossom
on a white background.

126
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,368
-Father...
-The people,

127
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,245
the wailing...

128
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,914
That boy who was crying...

129
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,875
That was really you?

130
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,045
Are you really...

131
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,090
Lee Gon?

132
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,051
He heard my wailing.

133
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,846
A lot more people

134
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,849
have come over
to this world than I had thought.

135
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,562
Answer my question, asshole.

136
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,564
Hands off, unless you want to die.

137
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,320
One thing is for sure.

138
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,575
You are the reason
why I must return to my world.

139
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,494
It seems like...

140
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,666
I am your king.

141
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,675
Can I ask

142
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,762
what else you remember
besides the wailing?

143
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,597
A particular location

144
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,849
or person.

145
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,234
Help me,

146
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,195
then I will help you.

147
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,365
Whatever you're looking for,

148
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,701
I'm sure I'm the closest person to it.

149
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,122
You want to help me?

150
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,417
Then get lost to your world.

151
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,005
You too.

152
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,591
If I spot you again,

153
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,845
I'll arrest you
for illegal firearm possession.

154
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,492
Don't worry. He left as a detective,

155
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,286
and as a close friend of someone.

156
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,706
-But Your Majesty--
-I know.

157
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,334
Lee Lim brought him here,
like the one in the basement.

158
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,671
He only remembers the emblem, so I guess

159
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,465
he came here when he was little.

160
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,136
Why bring a child here?

161
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,433
He must have needed his parents.

162
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,395
Whether it was his parents
in this world or ours.

163
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,857
I'll investigate this world
while you're away.

164
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,339
Why did you call me outside?

165
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,800
-It's cold, let's--
-I met Eun-sup just now.

166
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,097
But he wasn't Eun-sup.

167
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,312
I guess you already knew.

168
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,816
Sin-jae, how much have you seen?

169
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,694
What about you?

170
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,279
How far have you gone?

171
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,907
The science fiction you talked about

172
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:05,868
was that jerk?

173
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,705
Do you really believe everything
he's telling you?

174
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,708
Yes.

175
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,170
-I do.
-Why would you believe him?

176
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,631
-What do you believe?
-Everything.

177
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,841
I believe everything.

178
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,552
I'll explain everything I can to you.

179
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,263
I actually need your help--

180
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,874
You must've lost your mom.

181
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,174
I'll find her for you.

182
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,803
Sin-jae...

183
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,388
Sin-jae...

184
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,432
Doctor!

185
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,809
Doctor, he's awake!

186
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,936
My son is awake!

187
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,647
Can you see me?

188
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,441
Can you recognize me?

189
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,696
My baby, Sin-jae...

190
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,590
AUTOPSY REPORT

191
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,948
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

192
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,326
You did a great job, Eun-sup.

193
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,204
-Congratulations on becoming a civilian.
-Thank you, it's an honor.

194
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,874
You gathered for me on your day off.

195
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,420
Wow, look at the marbling of the meat.

196
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,549
The meat is unbelievable.

197
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,343
How can it be so tasty?

198
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,012
You only need to flip the beef over once.

199
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,431
-Chief, enjoy your food.
-Yeah.

200
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,352
-Eat up.
-Why aren't you eating?

201
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,940
You should eat too.

202
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,109
Congratulations, sir.

203
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,116
What? I'm two years older than him.

204
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,869
-Oh, right.
-Yes, that's right.

205
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,165
Hey, is Sin-jae coming or not?

206
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,169
I'll try messaging him again.

207
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,922
He has to. We're eating barbecue.

208
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,425
You got Jangmi's message, right?
We're celebrating Eun-sup's discharge.

209
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,718
-Eun-sup!
-Where are you?

210
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,679
Congratulations!

211
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,890
Thank you. The world is my oyster now.

212
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,892
It's all mine.

213
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:33,033
2.7182818284590452353602874

214
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,413
7135662497757147...

215
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,345
SATURDAY CONCERT

216
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,600
A police officer visited the care center.

217
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,147
They sent her away
without causing suspicion, so it's fine.

218
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,316
But Jang Yeon-ji caused trouble
and is in jail.

219
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,236
I canceled the phone we gave her,

220
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,740
and I'm working to retrieve it. And...

221
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,117
And?

222
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,539
That jerk Kim Gi-hwan disappeared.

223
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,959
I'm still looking for him.

224
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,756
A crack...

225
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,508
I hate that.

226
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,931
I suppose this is just

227
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,768
for answering the calls.

228
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,312
Take your own life.

229
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,648
It is a suicide order.

230
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:56,200
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD 3

231
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,542
PERSONAL INFO
LEE SANG-DO, AGE 45

232
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,921
This is a cooperative investigation
that only we can do.

233
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,425
Keep shaking while you're being shaken.

234
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,346
Make a crack to regain balance.

235
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,649
Weren't you taking the day off?

236
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,069
-You said you're going to play golf.
-Yes, in the afternoon.

237
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,533
KU Group's legal team
wants an interview with you.

238
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,618
Are you playing golf with them?

239
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,663
KU Group promised
that they'll hire one million new recruits

240
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,873
during the first half of next year.

241
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:50,671
The king took all the credit
for winning the war.

242
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,300
Let's tackle unemployment.

243
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,511
That shouldn't be a reason to meet them.

244
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,182
You said you wanted to know
where Congressman Park's photo came from.

245
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,310
When are you free?

246
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,021
Chairman Choe was asking for your visit.

247
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,525
I guess he's bored.

248
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,864
Tonight.

249
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,832
The sky bestows the heart upon us,

250
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,043
and the ground helps the spirit.

251
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,797
The sun and the moon are formed.

252
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,342
As the mountains and streams form,

253
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,304
lightning strikes.

254
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,432
A sage...

255
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,559
Sage...

256
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,852
Sage...

257
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,229
Sage...

258
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,148
A sage is moved

259
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,443
to defeat the evil of the mountains
and streams.

260
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,278
Uncle.

261
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,334
RESTRICTED NUMBER

262
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,011
Your Highness.

263
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,555
Do you know

264
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,518
what the phrase on that sword means?

265
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,605
Yes, it states the duties of a king.

266
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,442
So will Your Highness

267
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,403
fulfill all those duties?

268
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,912
A sage is moved to defeat

269
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,334
the evil of the mountains and streams.

270
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,337
Wield it with deep thoughts

271
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,673
and make things right.

272
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,345
Do you remember my voice?

273
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,017
I remember yours.

274
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,021
You'll need to hide even better.

275
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,109
I've just found out

276
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,531
that you're in the Republic of Korea.

277
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,229
You're wearing the shoes
I bought for you, Prime Minister Koo.

278
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,941
You bought it for so many bitches
that it became a trend.

279
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,364
They say even ex-husbands
can be useful somehow.

280
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,949
That was right.

281
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,537
I'm a bit late in thanking you.
That photo of Mr. Park was useful.

282
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,582
How does KU get photos like that?

283
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,001
Can you not? You just sat down...

284
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,129
Don't ask leading questions.

285
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,216
What kind of wife spies on her husband
24 hours a day?

286
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,718
Just tell me why you called me.

287
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,721
Isn't it obvious?

288
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,726
I was thinking that maybe I would get
something in return for what I did.

289
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,689
How about a special pardon for Christmas?

290
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,232
I've been good.

291
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,737
Don't you know
that Santa doesn't give presents to guys

292
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,407
who commit a breach of duty,
embezzlement, and diversion of funds?

293
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,993
Wow, I'm so disappointed.

294
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,330
I even donated to summer church camps.

295
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,043
I saw your photo with the king.

296
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,420
You were totally clinging to him.

297
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,714
A prime minister
wiretapping the royal court?

298
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,885
-That's treason, you know.
-Don't blackmail me.

299
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,930
I still have the files
from wiretapping you.

300
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,851
Guyeon tunnel project
seems to be the fishiest.

301
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,065
You're really scary.

302
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,151
I was just saying that
because I'm worried.

303
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,364
Are you really trying
to become the queen now?

304
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,323
Can't I?

305
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,826
Greed is the most sincere emotion.

306
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,328
What's so bad about that?

307
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,872
I wanted to become an announcer,

308
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,208
I wanted to get married to a rich man,

309
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,502
I wanted to become the prime minister,

310
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,422
and now I want to become the queen.

311
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,091
There's no limited term for the queen.

312
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,138
The king of the Kingdom of Corea
accepts the people's decision

313
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,266
and allows Prime Minister Koo
to form the Cabinet.

314
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,685
I...

315
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,187
came a very long way.

316
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,732
I climbed up here from the very bottom.

317
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,362
How can you be so ambitious
your whole life?

318
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,115
I'm sincere about everything.

319
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,993
My greed and my ambition, too.

320
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,330
Don't even dream about a Christmas present

321
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,166
and just wait for Buddha's birthday.

322
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,585
Let's go to church instead of a temple.

323
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:25,464
Take care of that deal
your legal team offered first.

324
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:27,883
And one more thing.

325
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,975
I keep getting mail
that my mom never sent me.

326
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,729
-Are you getting blackmailed?
-It could be a negotiation.

327
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,983
Find the ones who participated
in the treason 25 years ago.

328
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,694
Why would you negotiate
with the traitor's followers?

329
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,238
You want to catch them
to become the queen?

330
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,283
And you want me to do that for you?

331
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,995
If rumors spread about me
trying to catch those traitors

332
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,165
a year before my term ends,
I'll be finished.

333
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:06,338
This is what you're doing on your own.
If you want to at least go to a temple.

334
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,012
Is this how you ask for a favor?

335
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,307
Promise me we'll go to a temple, then.

336
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,862
Wow, this thing is pretty smart.

337
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:35,408
I only ordered food a few times,
but it recommends the stuff Mr. Lee likes.

338
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,998
-Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

339
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,047
Hey, where are you?

340
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm here by the--

341
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,301
I'm here too.

342
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,804
Next to you.

343
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,264
Right here.

344
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,850
You found your way easily.

345
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,020
This is a popular dating spot.

346
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,731
I guess you came here often in your world.

347
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,067
Of course, I've been here.

348
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,902
I knew it.

349
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,487
With who?

350
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,118
People from the Ministry
of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.

351
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,828
The mayor, directors of Seoul--

352
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,037
Let's eat.

353
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,043
Couples in the Republic of Korea
spend time near the water like this.

354
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,421
When they break up, they push each other.

355
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,638
This is pretty nice.

356
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,809
Alcohol, stars, water, chicken,

357
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,812
and jealousy.

358
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,607
Everything is perfect.

359
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,155
Eat up and regain your strength.

360
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,408
And have a good trip.

361
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,582
You said you receive
administration reports every Friday.

362
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,876
And today's Thursday.

363
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,048
You remembered that?

364
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,593
What kind of condition is that?

365
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,305
Do you realize you're a bad boyfriend?

366
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:33,068
I'm risking punishment for leaking
the case info by giving you this.

367
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,821
But I think the answer to this is
in your world.

368
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,240
He's dead in my world.

369
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,621
He's the son of the master Lee Gu-yong.

370
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,123
Your Majesty!

371
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,545
I already know the answer.

372
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,422
I've met him in person before.

373
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,717
You met Lee Sang-do?

374
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,344
Lee Sang-do

375
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,846
is alive?

376
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,183
I'll take care of this.
I'm giving you a job too.

377
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,520
I'm leaving Yeong here
and taking Eun-sup instead.

378
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,231
What do you mean?

379
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,110
Lee Lim is here right now,
in the Republic of Korea.

380
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,280
Then you shouldn't leave.
If he's here right now.

381
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,283
I should go and guard the path
between our worlds.

382
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,579
He must be caught in my world.

383
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,125
That's why I'm leaving Yeong here.

384
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,627
If worse comes to worse,

385
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,214
the only one who can kill him
in this world

386
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,466
is Yeong.

387
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,097
So,

388
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,560
this was really a matter
of life and death.

389
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,404
I'm sorry about causing trouble

390
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,407
in your world.

391
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,917
I was pretending to be okay,

392
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,795
but I'm not okay.

393
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,591
You'll be back soon, right?

394
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:23,887
I'll be back soon.

395
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,348
It'll be like visiting the next town over.

396
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,727
That's how quick I'll be.

397
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,070
No way. Don't come near me.

398
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,158
That's never going to happen. Do you know
how long it took for it to grow?

399
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,788
I never grow my hair long.

400
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,956
You could grow it long
during your vacation.

401
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,458
I'll say you felt too lazy.

402
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,380
Should I just cut off your head instead?

403
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,759
We could get rid of your head
instead of your hair.

404
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:07,096
Can't you keep such thoughts
just in your head?

405
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,439
Click, click, click.

406
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,781
You only think about the future, right?

407
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,785
People like that

408
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,164
can't win against people
who only think about the present.

409
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:59,274
Mr. Seok, head to the bamboo forest
near the race tracks right now.

410
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,652
His Majesty will be waiting for you there.

411
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,781
Take only a few guards,
and don't get curious about anything.

412
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,491
Don't ask any questions.

413
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,660
It's the king's orders.

414
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:16,708
Your Majesty!

415
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,252
Captain Jo!

416
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,213
He participated in the treason.

417
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,300
Lock him up in the deepest basement
of the palace.

418
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,888
And I forbid you to make any records
about him or mention him to anyone.

419
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,514
-Yes!
-Yes!

420
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,063
I'm telling you this in case you think
that this is the end.

421
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,815
This is only the beginning

422
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,235
for those who committed treason.

423
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,240
This is the appropriate and right measure.

424
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,498
JO YEONG

425
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,929
Why does it feel like I'm joining
the military again? My gosh.

426
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,931
Put on a bulletproof jacket
when get there.

427
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,308
It's not for you,
it's to protect the king.

428
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,852
You must protect him
with your life, all right?

429
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,647
This seems too thin.
Can it really stop bullets?

430
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,273
I should wear three of these.

431
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,526
-Captain Jo?
-Yes, sir? I mean what?

432
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,736
Are you going home?

433
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,948
When should I report
what happened while you were away?

434
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,491
A North Korean accent?

435
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,785
North Korea?

436
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,793
The Northern region?

437
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,128
The North...

438
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,927
Pyongyang University? Seok Ho-pil?

439
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,097
He must've been named
after a TV show character.

440
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,228
Sub-captain Seok,
what I say from now on is top secret.

441
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,146
Yes, Your Majesty!

442
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,941
First, place guards
around the bamboo forest

443
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,485
starting today
until I give further orders,

444
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,196
and arrest anyone who appears.

445
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,366
Be aware especially of a man in his 70s.

446
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,618
Secondly,

447
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,664
bring me all the security footage taken
near the events I attended last year.

448
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,582
As soon as possible.

449
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,376
Excuse me, but...

450
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:28,047
Are you giving orders to me,
and not Captain Jo?

451
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,218
He has something more important to do.

452
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,931
Yes, Your Majesty!

453
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,478
Yeong, bring your laptop.
It's your laptop, you understand?

454
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,024
"Yes, Your Majesty!"

455
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,278
That's what you should say.

456
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,115
Yes, Your Majesty!

457
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,297
Lady Noh, His Majesty is here.

458
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,433
Did you even know that I came back?

459
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:27,106
Your king has returned to the palace,
but you didn't come to see me once.

460
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,318
Well, you left without seeing me,
Your Majesty.

461
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,779
I sent the vice-captain

462
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,989
and I received the report
that you arrived.

463
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,617
I saw your face too.

464
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,536
You may leave now.

465
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,507
Oh, no.

466
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,218
Look how rough your face has become.

467
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,890
Did you stay up every night
worrying about me?

468
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,475
Is that why?

469
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:03,976
My goodness.

470
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,772
I've been at peace since you weren't here.

471
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,983
I slept soundly from early in the evening.

472
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,488
There must be a lot of work
to catch up on.

473
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,490
You should go now.

474
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,912
Why do you keep telling me to go?
Why aren't you asking me anything?

475
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,915
I was going to tell you everything

476
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,795
if you asked me where I was.

477
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,681
I already know.

478
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,474
I know

479
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,144
where you're going.

480
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,277
You're chasing

481
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,530
your destiny, aren't you?

482
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,997
This is a secret
between you and me, right?

483
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,352
-Your Majesty.
-Carry on.

484
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,854
Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,231
All right, let's finish up.

486
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,372
Is there something you'd like to order--

487
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,457
No.

488
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,793
My goodness!

489
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,171
How can you make such a mistake?

490
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,688
How could you when you don't even have

491
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,609
the guts

492
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,154
nor the caliber?

493
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,036
Until further orders,
put him under house arrest

494
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,163
and restrict access to the palace.

495
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,626
He is to be forbidden from contacting
and meeting anyone else from now on.

496
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,962
SEOUL JONGNO POLICE STATION

497
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,172
Sin-jae went on vacation?

498
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,216
He's using all 21 days in one go.

499
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,094
You don't know what's going on either?

500
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,807
I'll try calling him.

501
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,850
Is something going on at home?

502
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,687
My gosh, maybe his mother--

503
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,604
Hey, stop it.

504
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,857
I'm just worried.
I think it's because of her.

505
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,535
Sin-jae.

506
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,206
Hwa-yeon, this is Tae-eul.

507
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,421
SIN-JAE

508
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,565
I knew today was going to be my lucky day.

509
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,527
We have a precious guest
even before opening hours.

510
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,161
Detective Kang,
I guess you're feeling a bit down.

511
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,205
Sharing your sadness makes it better.

512
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,541
Do you want to share it with me?

513
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,841
If you want to do some sharing,
why don't you share some peanuts?

514
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,136
The food here is too expensive.

515
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,723
I'm so upset that you're worried
about the cost of our food.

516
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,267
Why are you so humble?

517
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,063
Anyhow, thanks for visiting
when you're having a hard time.

518
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,816
You made the right choice. Stuff like this

519
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,029
can be comforting
when things get rough. Here.

520
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,575
You can have all the food
you want with this.

521
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,753
Here.

522
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,922
Can I do installments?

523
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,259
And count this one out, I didn't open it.

524
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,763
Why did you come here then?

525
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,643
Someone I know calls me their brother.

526
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,564
That person is really smart
and persistent.

527
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:06,195
The only place I can stay hidden
from that person is here.

528
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:20,876
Hey.

529
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,337
Bring some peanuts to room nine.

530
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,551
-Do you need anything else?
-Let me use this room for a few days.

531
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,096
I'm on vacation,

532
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,349
but I have nowhere to go.

533
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,644
If you're on vacation,
just go somewhere nice and warm!

534
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,105
Damn it.

535
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,232
My gosh.

536
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,025
Where are you going?

537
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,237
To church. For evening service.

538
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,282
Why can't you just ask me
for money instead!

539
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:52,908
Damn it.

540
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,010
JO YEONG

541
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,605
Who's the one who said,

542
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,733
"Yeong is simple, and I'm good at math"

543
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,862
and told me to bring his laptop
as if he could unlock it right away?

544
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,282
It may seem like I'm having a hard time
unlocking it, but...

545
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,784
I'm checking the court's security levels.

546
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:37,828
Yeah, right.

547
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,999
But what's in it? Why are you making
such a fuss to unlock it?

548
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,673
Prime Minister Koo is here.

549
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,055
The year-end report.

550
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,225
It's that time already?

551
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,310
Yes. A year passed by so quickly.

552
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,437
Do you want anything
for a late-night snack?

553
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,357
Sweet potatoes. I'm on a diet right now.

554
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,526
I'll be off, then.

555
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,780
Hello, Your Majesty. 

556
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,200
Welcome.

557
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,870
We've heightened
the security at the palace.

558
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,789
He'll be with us the whole time.

559
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:23,958
As you already know,

560
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,086
we'll be up all night
going over a year's worth of reports.

561
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,588
Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,008
Sin-jae? He didn't come here.

563
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,719
He didn't go to work?
Why are you asking me?

564
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,181
That's classified information.

565
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,560
Just call me if he comes here.

566
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,687
Okay. But Tae-eul,

567
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,733
isn't Eun-sup acting strange these days?

568
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,907
Eun-sup? Why?

569
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,034
I didn't notice anything weird.

570
00:42:59,118 --> 00:42:59,952
It feels like

571
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,621
he's not as handsome as before.

572
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,707
He looks a bit lame.

573
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,501
What's up with his hair?

574
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,881
You really have a strange taste.

575
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,889
Let's meet at the hotel from now on.

576
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,977
Na-ri and Eun-sup are going to fall apart
at this rate.

577
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,104
What do you want?

578
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,653
This one. I heard you know a decent place
that pays you well.

579
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,241
Yeah, I do.

580
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,830
I've been selling so much stuff
that the owner thinks I'm a corrupt cop.

581
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:50,628
Anyway, I'll sell this for you,
so let me use the hotel room too.

582
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,380
-I could use the space.
-The king isn't there--

583
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,423
You're here.

584
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:59,178
But what do you want to get
with the money from selling this?

585
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,682
I need revenue to gain mobility.

586
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,731
DRIVING TEST VEHICLE

587
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,985
The driving test will begin now.

588
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,613
-You don't have a license?
-You have passed.

589
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,240
SOCIAL SECURITY CARD
DRIVER'S LICENSE

590
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,660
I took the test.

591
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,079
I usually pass any kind of test I take.

592
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,332
-I got perfect scores on CSAT.
-I don't know what that is.

593
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,626
You took the test but have no license?

594
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,836
Because I sucked at making turns.

595
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,798
A man should go straight all the way.

596
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,009
I have a good reason.

597
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,554
But why are you trying to go
when you can't even drive?

598
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,974
If you're thinking of it
as an overseas trip, just quit.

599
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,559
You'll get caught when you talk--

600
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,399
Should I just rip your throat?

601
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,359
If you lose your voice--

602
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,443
Hey!

603
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,490
Hey.

604
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,410
I know you care about King Arthur,

605
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,204
but you won't be as sincere as I am
for my siblings.

606
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,583
Well, King Arthur told me

607
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,796
that this is how
I can protect my siblings.

608
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,679
Are you doing well, Jo Eun-sup?

609
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,060
If we're to maintain the budget
for education,

610
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,521
we need drastic changes
for the medical sector.

611
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,736
Do we need to choose one?

612
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,029
The department wants to lower
the welfare budget

613
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,450
and increase the budget for factors
such as technology and service.

614
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,701
For national interest.

615
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,163
Medical service and education
are the people's rights, not benefits.

616
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,039
Let's move on.

617
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,252
There's a supplementary budget

618
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,629
of 5.2 trillion won for disaster relief.

619
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,715
It's designated as a special disaster zone

620
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,010
and we're trying to restore
and help people to live their daily lives.

621
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,136
Great.

622
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,808
Did that traveler return safely?

623
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,727
Is work boring?

624
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,524
She returned to her daily life.

625
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,283
DONGNAE PENITENTIARY

626
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,621
I hope she had a good time here.

627
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,380
I'm much more productive
after I eat something spicy.

628
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,590
I work faster, too.

629
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,718
Yeong, let's eat.

630
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,683
Wow, how can you sweet potatoes
for every meal?

631
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,438
Effort never betrays you.

632
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,026
You need kimchi with sweet potatoes.

633
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,154
DELICIOUS KIMCHI

634
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,034
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

635
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,494
Have you tried this pairing?

636
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,664
Lady Noh always gave these to me.

637
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,587
It's really tasty.

638
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,591
Yeong. Let's hurry up and eat.

639
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,802
Yes, Your Majesty.

640
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,389
Why aren't you eating?

641
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,100
I'll gain weight
if I eat three times a day.

642
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,352
Aren't you getting married?

643
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,314
That was a rather random question.

644
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,607
Why?

645
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,569
-Do you want to marry me?
-Can I?

646
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:44,987
No.

647
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,573
I already proposed to someone else.

648
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,659
What's the next agenda?

649
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,036
Wow.

650
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,038
This world is very aggressive.

651
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,961
I told you, we're closed for today.

652
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,046
You need to make an appointment first.

653
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,257
He's here for me. You can go home now.

654
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,550
All right.

655
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,723
Sweets aren't helping?

656
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,059
Or have you just realized
that they don't help?

657
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,477
Have a seat.

658
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,439
I want to get some sleep.

659
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,568
-Can I get a prescription?
-Not without an examination.

660
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,987
Don't turn me into a real quack
and sit down.

661
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,282
I'm not the type that goes on
about your subconscious or whatever,

662
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,408
so don't worry.

663
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,079
I believe a quick diagnosis
and the right medication is better.

664
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,122
Like a cold.

665
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,000
Can't you just introduce me to a quack?

666
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,377
Even alcohol isn't helping now.

667
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,339
Are you sure?
Maybe you just didn't drink enough.

668
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,135
Are you sure you're a real doctor?

669
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,933
Wow.

670
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,476
This is amazing.

671
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,488
Wow.

672
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,091
Eun-sup?

673
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,844
Take that off.

674
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,764
The king never shares his belongings
with others.

675
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,727
Damn, you're so cheap.
I wanted to get some skincare, too.

676
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,108
By the way,

677
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,319
how did you unlock Yeong's cell phone?

678
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:53,865
Like this.

679
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:01,415
Have you still not unlocked his laptop?
Should I give it a try?

680
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,002
You're always up for a challenge.

681
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,046
But security in the Royal Court
isn't something that simple.

682
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,007
Wake me if you do unlock it.

683
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,883
Then I'll give you one too.

684
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,177
This is a special skincare product

685
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,722
made especially for the king.

686
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:31,987
I unlocked it.

687
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,285
J, and then 13 zeros.

688
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,787
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

689
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,665
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, and zero.
"Jo" as in trillion,

690
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,542
and "Yeong" as in zero.

691
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,642
We didn't take any photos together.

692
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,148
It's too cold outside now.

693
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,775
You should grow here from now on.

694
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,652
What did you plant?

695
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,738
Seeds I got from your world.

696
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,740
But it's not sprouting.

697
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,450
Is it being shy?

698
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,122
Listen up.

699
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:48,915
I am your king.

700
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,877
I order you to grow well.

701
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,297
I order you to sprout and bloom

702
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,301
in the garden of the woman I like.
It's a king's order.

703
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:05,223
And you're still saying
that it's your first time dating?

704
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,768
That statement is never going to change
until the next life.

705
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:15,901
The seeds I scattered
in that strange place.

706
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,361
Did they not sprout?

707
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:20,989
I told you.

708
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,951
There's no wind, sunlight, or time there.

709
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,287
I was just asking.

710
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,833
Did you try going to the edge?

711
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,712
I tried to, but I couldn't reach the edge.

712
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,756
I shouldn't stay there long.

713
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,968
Even if I spend one day in there,
two months flow by outside.

714
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,598
Then if you're in there,
you won't grow old.

715
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,602
Hang on.

716
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,356
Then I could actually be older than you.

717
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,985
No wonder. You seemed
to be getting younger these days.

718
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,782
Even if I can have eternal life in there,
I'll come to you.

719
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,160
If I'm late, it's because I'm on my way.

720
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,998
Don't think about coming to me.
Think about going together.

721
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,708
Don't go somewhere nice without me.

722
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,809
I think I'm going to miss you so much.

723
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,104
Can't you

724
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,856
come with me?

725
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,902
Can't you live with me...

726
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,489
in my world?

727
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,162
I'm adding one more of the 17 things.

728
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,709
Don't ask me to come with you.

729
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,170
What about this world?

730
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,298
What about my dad?

731
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,507
And Na-ri,

732
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,301
and the station?

733
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,470
Saying that just puts me in a tight spot.

734
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,394
What was that?

735
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,272
-Did you stop me from talking?
-No, I stopped myself.

736
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:22,402
This is what we do
when we have too many things to say.

737
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,321
That's the law in--

738
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,868
I have to follow the law.

739
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,745
I'm a civil servant, you know.

740
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,690
I'm seeing...

741
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,319
something beautiful again.

742
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,646
What?

743
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,902
Was I mistaken?

744
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,702
Haesong Bookstore,

745
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,663
May 27, 2022.

746
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:43,168
2022...

747
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,340
Is it an error?

748
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,431
Tae-eul wasn't

749
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,017
wearing that on that day.

750
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,439
What is this?

751
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,045
Did you retrieve the cell phone?

752
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,964
I'm on it.

753
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,675
I've been looking into something else too.

754
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,767
You know, Kang Sin-jae.

755
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,562
He went to see Song Jeong-hye's son
at the cinerarium.

756
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,899
And the cop that visited
the care center before...

757
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,109
It's a bitch named Jeong Tae-eul.

758
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,987
I looked into it,
and she's the one who caught Jang Yeon-ji.

759
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,573
She's looking for her phone, too.

760
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,450
Kang Sin-jae...

761
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,286
The wrong move I made.

762
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,122
And Jeong Tae-eul,

763
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,085
the move I didn't make.

764
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,712
Don't worry. I'll find it first.

765
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,341
Should I just bury them both somewhere?

766
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,105
Just get rid of Jang Yeon-ji,

767
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,316
and don't do anything else.

768
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,027
I need to leave again.

769
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:40,034
I think my nephew will know by now.

770
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,130
That bookstore you asked me to find...

771
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,883
There is no Haesong Bookstore
registered anywhere in this kingdom.

772
00:59:56,634 --> 01:00:00,763
I looked online, and even through
used bookstores, but there's nothing.

773
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,308
And this.

774
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:07,312
I got all the security footage
of the events you asked for.

775
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:12,025
Good job. Keep looking for the bookstore.

776
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,485
Look for ones that are closed, too.

777
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,487
Yes, Your Majesty.

778
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,335
Back then, he was in
the Republic of Korea.

779
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,588
So if the time stops again,

780
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,591
he's in the Kingdom of Corea.

781
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,476
We're closed today--

782
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,064
I'm sorry.

783
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,734
The door was open.

784
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,695
Yes. I'm waiting for a delivery.

785
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,032
If there's anything you're looking for,
I can get it.

786
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,033
It's all right.

787
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:06,954
I was just thinking of looking
at medical books if you have any.

788
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,124
We don't have medical books here.

789
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,709
Nobody comes looking for them.

790
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,252
Oh, I see.

791
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,255
But

792
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,218
have we met before?

793
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,435
I've seen you.

794
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,938
You're the royal family.

795
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,650
Sometimes I forget that.

796
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,610
Sorry for the trouble.

797
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,432
You come here every year
without telling me in advance.

798
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:12,937
Because you're here every year
as if we've made a promise.

799
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,484
Have you found any answers yet?

800
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,653
I found a symbol,

801
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,032
but I'm having trouble with it
because the solution isn't good.

802
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,577
I'm sure you will be able to solve it.

803
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,829
You've always done so.

804
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,956
Uncle,

805
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,418
do you believe in fate?

806
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,632
It's a hard concept
for a math and science person.

807
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,677
It's not something clear.

808
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:49,515
People usually tell fate to move aside
and challenge it.

809
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,603
Should I fight against it?

810
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:57,648
You can never know
what will happen in life.

811
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,027
But if there is a place you want to reach

812
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:06,115
even if your life may be at risk,

813
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,284
that is fate.

814
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,829
The footsteps you take

815
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:19,045
by risking your whole life is what's fate.

816
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,594
Is there a place you want to reach?

817
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,640
Yes. There is.

818
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,393
Then you just have to go there.
You don't need to fight.

819
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,648
I hope there is a beautiful lady there.

820
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,401
You should really get married this year.

821
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,571
If I find the solution,

822
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:51,661
I will visit you again with a woman
who argues that the earth is flat.

823
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,664
All right.
I will be waiting, Your Majesty.

824
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,379
It's the first sunrise of the new year.

825
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,199
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul,

826
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,077
happy New Year.

827
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,136
Lee Lim...

828
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,307
has finally come over
to the Kingdom of Corea.

829
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,855
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2020

830
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,381
It's the king!

831
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:03,960
I'm sure

832
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,129
he is watching me.

833
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,096
But he isn't in the videos.

834
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,307
Why?

835
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,858
What have I missed?

836
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,328
Then if you're in there,
you won't grow old.

837
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,136
This...

838
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,515
doesn't make sense.

839
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:50,649
No way.

840
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,234
He's...

841
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,945
delaying time inside that place.

842
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,010
Someone who does not age.

843
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,265
A near-immortal life.

844
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,852
That is what you want

845
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:09,854
to achieve.

846
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:12,857
Eternity.

847
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:17,820
Traitor,

848
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,533
Lee Lim!

849
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:23,886
"Traitor Lee Lim." Is this true?

850
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,055
You're still alive.

851
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,390
I'm looking forward
to the next time we meet.

852
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,934
Those with the same faces...

853
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,186
You asked me how far I've gone.

854
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:33,646
...are stealing...

855
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,273
I tried calling his name
that I remembered.

856
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,525
-...their counterparts' lives.
-Lee Gon.

857
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:42,071
-Is there something I don't know?
-Can you really do it?

858
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:46,742
And for some people, it gives them
the courage to face their fate.

859
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,080
-Prince Imperial Geum.
-Can you abandon everything here

860
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:54,541
and become the queen
of the Kingdom of Corea?
