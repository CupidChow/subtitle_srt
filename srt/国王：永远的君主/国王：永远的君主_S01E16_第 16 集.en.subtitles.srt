EPISODE 16

4
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,544
When is she getting home? Goodness.

5
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,467
Dad, I'm on a stakeout tonight.
I have to go pretty far.

6
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,718
Gosh.

7
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,151
Catch that jerk. And don't skip a meal.

8
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,070
I'm fine, so don't worry.

9
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,285
Talk to you soon, Dad.

10
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,529
Walk.

11
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,052
KINGDOM OF COREA, 1994
THE NIGHT OF THE TREASON

12
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,116
Tell me what to do. I'll lead the way.

13
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,660
The traitors will arrive here
in about 20 minutes.

14
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,622
Yeong, I want you to stay here
and stop them from getting away.

15
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,125
Kill them all
as soon as you spot them.

16
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,711
Then will you be going
to Cheonjongo alone?

17
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,214
If I fail my mission at Cheonjongo,

18
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,176
you must kill Lee Lim at all costs.

19
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,221
What on earth are you planning to do?

20
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,434
Don't tell me...

21
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,855
No. No way.

22
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,608
This is my last order.

23
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,949
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

24
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,202
I must go to Cheonjongo.

25
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,954
I...

26
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,249
must protect my king.

27
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,418
That is my duty.

28
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,671
You cannot.

29
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,007
Yeong.

30
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,801
This is our last chance.

31
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,971
The same goes for me.

32
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,100
This is my last chance

33
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,479
to protect Your Majesty.

34
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,402
I hoped everything would unfold
exactly the same as it did that night.

35
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,282
Take care, Your Majesty.

36
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,969
At what point did things start to change?

37
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,935
FOUR TIGER SWORD

38
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,195
Beautiful equations are always simple.

39
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,950
Not everyone in the world can be brave.

40
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,035
So I decided to be brave.

41
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,413
-Captain!
-Captain!

42
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,624
No, I'll go.
Do I just have to go with this jerk?

43
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,715
Tonight,

44
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,009
I'm not alone.

45
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,889
We just haven't

46
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,184
reached our destination yet.

47
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,364
So?

48
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,575
What's your plan?

49
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,243
I will wait.

50
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:38,416
Until Gon stops you in the past
and puts everything back in its place.

51
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,669
If he fails,

52
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,630
I will stop you.

53
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,177
But if my nephew restores order,

54
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,930
your memories of him will be gone.

55
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,767
That's why

56
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm heartbroken.

57
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,941
All those radiant memories

58
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,653
are engraved deep in my heart.

59
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,417
You can't shoot here.

60
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,546
-Everything is at a standstill.
-How would you know

61
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,133
if no one's ever tried
to fire a gun here before?

62
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,585
Do you really think
you can hurt me with that?

63
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,343
I will try!

64
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,476
Tell me what to do.

65
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,149
Kill him.

66
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,304
There's an emergency in Cheonjongo.
Calling all Royal Guards.

67
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,264
Royal Guards assemble immediately.

68
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,001
Why did the Manpasikjeok...

69
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,758
I must have obtained
the whole Manpasikjeok.

70
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,305
Finally, I got my hands

71
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,018
on the whole Manpasikjeok.

72
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,433
If mine is gone,

73
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,979
the other half that my nephew had
is probably gone too.

74
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,773
What now?

75
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,194
This means that Gon can never come back.

76
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,157
And you're stuck here with me
for an eternity.

77
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,084
Your Majesty!

78
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,794
Your Highness.

79
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,506
-Your Majesty!
-Your Highness!

80
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,466
-Where is His Majesty?
-Your Highness!

81
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,928
-Your Highness, where are you?
-Are you okay?

82
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,348
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

83
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,517
Your Majesty! Where are you?

84
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,185
Your Highness!

85
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,735
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty.

86
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,571
-Your Highness!
-Your Majesty.

87
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,282
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

88
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,785
-Your Majesty.
-Are you all right?

89
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,206
Take His Majesty and His Highness
to the hospital at once!

90
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:39,503
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness.

91
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,975
From now on,
you are the Unbreakable Sword.

92
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,773
Mom.

93
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,276
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

94
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,198
It's a very long story.

95
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,574
Gosh, my dear son...

96
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,912
There's something
dad's been hiding from you.

97
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,122
-Look how you've grown.
-To be exact,

98
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,378
-it's about your son, Kang Sin-jae.
-My baby...

99
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,927
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

100
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,888
Sin-jae.

101
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,225
I had no idea.

102
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,770
You.

103
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,939
When did you find out?

104
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,733
The fact that my son is in this mess.

105
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,695
How long have you been
hiding this from me?

106
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,364
What will you do about this?

107
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,033
Bring my son back!

108
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,789
What will you do?
What are you going to do about this?

109
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,625
Gosh, I can't believe this.

110
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,672
My poor baby...

111
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,485
Sin-jae!

112
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,116
Sin-jae!

113
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,453
Mom.

114
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:27,921
I'm sorry.

115
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
I should have given you a hug.

116
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,428
You're also my son.

117
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,723
I know it's not your fault.

118
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,602
I should've given you a hug first.

119
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,936
I'm...

120
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,230
I'm really sorry.

121
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,149
Sorry.

122
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,201
Mom.

123
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,129
I was right.

124
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,006
I was right after all.

125
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,971
This must be the door to another world.

126
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,722
Traitor Lee Lim.

127
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,214
Who the hell are you?

128
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,009
Why are you after me?

129
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,305
And why do you have the Four Tiger Sword?

130
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,684
I am the king of the Kingdom of Corea,

131
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,896
the owner of the Four Tiger Sword,

132
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,650
and the one who will carry out
your capital punishment.

133
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,943
The king?

134
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,821
The king just died at my hands.

135
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,366
So how could you be the king?

136
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,287
I suppose my dear nephew has failed

137
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,166
seeing how I'm still alive and well.

138
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,172
No, you're not.

139
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,093
If Gon has failed, you won't be for long.

140
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,649
It is quite entertaining
to watch how foolishly hopeful you are.

141
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,112
But I can't tolerate it any longer.

142
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,870
TAEKWONDO

143
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,866
"The sky bestows the heart upon us,

144
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,452
and the ground helps the spirit."

145
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,954
"The sun and the moon are formed.

146
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,916
As the mountains and streams form,

147
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,754
lightning strikes."

148
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,215
You must be the crown prince.

149
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,890
This must be the power
of the Manpasikjeok.

150
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,726
You are

151
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,812
Lee Gon.

00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,193

"Wield it with deep thoughts

154
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,533
and make things right."

155
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,828
Traitor Lee Lim.

156
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,957
You are to be beheaded.

157
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,820
I thought this would break.

158
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,156
But it sprouted instead.

159
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,286
The door will close,
and only the memories will remain.

160
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,415
-What's with you?
-Right?

161
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,542
-I hope I didn't fail.
-You're the worst.

162
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,919
Hey.

163
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,046
I'm sorry.

164
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,389
Should I break it?

165
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,142
Or just let it be?

166
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,413
You did it.

167
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,877
Then I guess

168
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,839
you won't come back.

169
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,548
If our worlds flow differently
from the present,

170
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,717
then I won't

171
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,595
be able to remember you.

172
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,766
Then I'll live without knowing you.

VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION SQUAD THREE

REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 1994

175
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,920
I guess there is a god.

176
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,257
My husband just died.

177
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,138
I prayed every day that he'd die.

178
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,808
I thought I would

179
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,229
end up either dying or killing him

180
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,067
before leaving this house.

181
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,494
But...

182
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,747
someone else killed him

183
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,833
for me.

00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,433
have nowhere to go, Seong-jae.

186
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,270
So...

187
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,237
you'll have to go.

188
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,743
Don't worry.

189
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,788
I won't do what Ji-hun's dad did.

190
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,345
I can't look after you at home
because I have to work.

191
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,766
Ji-hun and I will visit you once a month.

192
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,357
I love you, Uncle. From Ji-hun.

193
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,946
Let's just die together.

194
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,198
-Let's die together.
-No!

195
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,825
-Hyeon-min!
-Mom!

196
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,494
-Let's die together.
-Don't do this.

197
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,455
-Mom, no!
-Hyeon-min!

198
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,582
-Mom! Stop!
-I'm really sorry!

199
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,043
It will only take a second. Hyeon-min!

200
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,129
-I'm so sorry!
-Stop...

201
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,089
-I'm sorry.
-Stop!

202
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,341
Don't mind us and just be on your way!

203
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,843
What on earth are you doing?

204
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,428
-Mom!
-Come here.

205
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,889
All of you.

206
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,601
Back off.
You scared this lady and her son.

207
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,227
Mom.

208
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,404
Kiddo, here's your shoe.

209
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,823
Here. Oh, hold on.

210
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,744
There.

211
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,040
Prince Buyeong?

212
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,962
Yes, that's me.

213
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,131
What is your name?

214
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,930
I'm Kang Hyeon-min.

215
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,392
I assume it's "Hyeon" as in "to shine,"
and "Min" as in "jade."

216
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,480
Your name means that you're someone
who "shines like a jewel."

217
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,823
Why would a member of the royal family
bother to talk to people like us?

218
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,659
I'm talking to you as a parent,

219
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,787
not as a member of the royal family.

220
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,665
Your choices determine your destiny,

221
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:38,628
but no one gets to choose their parents.

222
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,923
So change this choice of yours

223
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:47,554
for the choice you make will determine
this boy's fate.

224
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,646
How about we go have a cup of tea?

225
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,649
That's what I'd prescribe to you
as a doctor.

226
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,954
KINGDOM OF COREA, 1999

227
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,247
-Is this it?
-Yes.

228
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,833
-Have a nice day.
-You too. Take care.

229
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,468
KOO SEO-RYEONG

230
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,056
Look at that.

231
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,143
How dare you glare at me? You thief.

232
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,194
How old are you? And what's your name?

233
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,988
She doesn't have a name.

234
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,366
I'm sure she's stolen
from every vendor at this market.

235
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,453
I do have a name. I'm Luna.

236
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,373
That's such a pretty name.

237
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,920
My daughter is very strong, isn't she?

238
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,840
I want to apologize to you on her behalf.
Do you want to eat here?

239
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,468
What? You need to call the police.

240
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,470
What are you? A charity worker?

241
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,642
It's all right. Here, come on.

242
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,904
Have some food first,
and you can take this.

243
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,283
You can't take the whole thing.
I didn't sell much today.

244
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,757
Why would you give me this?
Is it too little?

245
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,427
I'm paying for the food.

246
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,764
Really?

247
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,892
You're paying too much.

248
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,146
You'll have to eat a lot, okay?

249
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,505
Are you all right? Do you need some help?

250
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,340
-Isn't that a gun?
-That's blood!

251
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,134
What is going on? She's bleeding!

252
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,517
My goodness. What do we do?

253
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,645
-We should go.
-Where am I?

254
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,732
Is this the Republic of Korea?

255
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,610
What's the date today?

256
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:54,115
Yes, this is the Republic of Korea.
And today is April 25, 2020.

257
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,706
I'm a police officer.
Can I use your phone to make a quick call?

258
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,633
Chief Park?

259
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,594
Chief Park.

260
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,345
It's me, Tae-eul.

261
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,683
Where's Jangmi?
What about Detective Shim and Sin-jae?

262
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,331
For me, only about a week had passed.

263
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,711
KIND CIVIL POLICE
BY THE CITIZENS' SIDE

264
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,380
-There she is.
-Here she comes.

265
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,842
-Why did you kill your fellow actress?
-Was it because of the role?

266
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,344
How do you feel?

267
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,388
-Anything you'd like to say?
-Do you admit to the crime?

268
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:04,227
The world seemed unchanged,
yet some things had unfolded differently.

269
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,686
What did you say?

270
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,313
I was still a lieutenant.

271
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,481
Are you donating?

272
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,484
And I still tried to be nice to my dad
once a month.

273
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,621
And I lived everyday

274
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,542
with my memories of him still intact,

275
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:33,422
in a world where he or Sin-jae

276
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,926
no longer exists.

277
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,979
It's not you, right?

278
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,107
-Pardon?
-You're not the one

279
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,775
who keeps calling my hubby out.

280
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,573
It is me. I did that--

281
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,617
-Get going.
-Okay.

282
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,630
CIRCLE MART, ILSAN CITY BRANCH
BACKPACK, SNEAKERS

283
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,342
The person who keeps calling my hubby over
must be starting school next year.

284
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,853
Bo-gyeong!

285
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,282
You...

286
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,037
Hee-ju.

287
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,416
When snow piles up,
it can make some roofs collapse.

288
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,628
The weight of snow

289
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,547
can be unbearable to some 16-year-old kid.

290
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,051
Is that your solitude?

291
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,636
Yes.

292
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,471
You could say that.

293
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,974
Do you remember Seong-min's friend?

294
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,852
-Yes.
-That's his grandmother and sister.

295
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,606
As you can probably guess,
his grandmother is very ill.

296
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,943
He couldn't pay the hospital bills,

297
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,197
so he stole money
from the safe at his job.

298
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,658
-And?
-And

299
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,578
he asked me for a favor
before he got arrested.

300
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,667
He asked me to buy his sister
a bag of steamed buns.

301
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:38,589
And he also asked me
to remove snow from their roof.

302
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,596
That's why I started visiting her,
and here I am.

303
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,517
She needs hope
to get through it all, you know?

304
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,939
But I had no idea I'd see you here.

305
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,484
My goodness, seriously.

306
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,196
Come on.
I thought you were here to plow snow.

307
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,574
Honey, shall we hold hands?

308
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,869
Well, how about I build a snowman for you?

309
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,411
LEE JI-HUN

310
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,184
If that door closes,

311
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,064
I'll open every single door
in the universe. And…

312
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,609
I'll come to you.

313
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,750
You said you'd come.

314
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,768
Who might you be?

315
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,853
Can I help you?

316
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,897
I'm looking for someone,

317
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,609
but it seems she's not in this world.

318
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,696
All right, then.

319
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,089
Can I help you?

320
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,762
Even here,

321
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,641
you're busy protecting someone.

322
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,769
JEONG EUN-KYEONG
REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARMY

323
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,233
-Tae-ra, we're here.
-Okay.

324
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,903
Tae-ra, be careful
not to step on the dress.

325
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,905
Hold on. Here.

326
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,615
Hyeong-taek.

327
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,909
Where's my trophy?

328
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,036
My trophy for the Grand Prize.

329
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,329
It's in the boss' car.

330
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:42,291
-I'll bring it tomorrow.
-Grand Prize, Jeong Tae-ra!

331
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,508
Once again, I'd like to sincerely thank
Hyeong-taek, Yeong-han, Eun-gi,

332
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,636
and Hye-yeon. I owe it all to you guys.

333
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,601
Hey, who's that handsome man?

334
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,730
Are you a member of Tae-ra Byte?

335
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,359
Sorry, no photos.
I'll take the flowers though.

336
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,777
It seems like

337
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,613
you already received flowers.

338
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,449
These flowers

339
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,660
are not for you.

340
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,955
I can't believe what I just heard.

341
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,832
Why aren't they for me?

342
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,714
I'm Jeong Tae-ra, the Grand Prize winner.
I won the Grand Prize today.

343
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,025
Who are you?

344
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,153
Hyo-jin!

345
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,199
Mom, why did you buy so much stuff?
It must be heavy.

346
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,869
-I should've gone with you.
-I'm okay. Who is he?

347
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,083
Are you here to see Hyo-jin?

348
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,043
Mom, no.

349
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,631
I'm sorry, but who are you looking for?

350
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,302
In this world,

351
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,762
you're with your mother.

352
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,099
I'm glad.

353
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,567
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 2021

354
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,777
Hey, Na-ri.

355
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,738
Tae-eul, don't be surprised.

356
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,948
I think your dad bought a horse.

357
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,492
-A horse?
-Yes.

358
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,455
There's some guy on a white horse
at the Taekwondo center now.

359
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:49,209
I guess he's selling the horse.
This guy looks like a pro.

360
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,466
Na-ri, I have to go.

361
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,248
You exist

362
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,126
across every universe.

363
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,382
And you still don't know me.

364
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,639
But you...

365
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,059
Why are you crying?

366
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:53,190
You seemed happy in every world.
It was the only thing that comforted me.

367
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,531
But you...

368
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,412
Why do you look
as if you recognize me?

369
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,498
Why do you look

370
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,128
as if you remember everything?

371
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,599
JEONG TAE-EUL
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

372
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,653
Is it you?

373
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,451
Jeong Tae-eul.

374
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,622
Is it really you? Yes?

375
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,502
You came?

376
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,839
You really

377
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,841
came for me?

378
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:04,887
You've finally

379
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,139
arrived.

380
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:13,937
Finally.

381
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,400
I finally got to see you,

382
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,237
Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.

383
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,833
What took you so long?

384
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,628
I kept waiting for you.

385
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,130
Every single day,

386
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,133
I waited for you.

387
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,269
After I slew the traitor,

388
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,939
I had to go back and get Yeong.

389
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,487
DECEMBER 13, 1994, EMERGENCY ALARMS
WENT OFF IN CHEONJONGO AT 23:15

390
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:09,368
KINGDOM OF COREA, 2021

391
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:16,625
DECEMBER 14, 1994, TRAITOR LEE LIM
FOUND DEAD IN THE BAMBOO GROVE

392
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,058
So I had to find my way back again.

393
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,937
I had to open every single door
in the universe.

394
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,566
That's why it took me so long.

395
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,987
And I didn't think you'd remember me
even if I did find you.

396
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:49,867
Yet you still

397
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,245
kept looking for me?

398
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,915
Even if you forgot all about me,
I still wanted to see you.

399
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,878
I was going to tell you again
if you forgot me.

400
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,299
That I am the king
of the Kingdom of Corea,

401
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:10,846
and that my name, which is not supposed
to be called, is Lee Gon.

402
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:21,231
But how do you still remember me
when the two worlds flowed differently?

403
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,733
Let's skip that.

404
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,154
I've also been through many things myself.

405
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,742
And now, this.

406
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,611
Do you still

407
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,238
hate flowers?

408
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:15,953
No, I like them.

409
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,541
Especially this flower.

410
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,179
I realized I haven't told you this.

411
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:39,768
I love you.

412
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,146
I am deeply...

413
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,025
in love with you.

414
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,202
So this is

415
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,456
how everything comes together.

416
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,878
I love you too.

417
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,340
I...

418
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,301
love you so much too.

419
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:46,209
KINGDOM OF COREA, 2022

420
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,795
The twins are doing well?

421
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,465
I'm stressed from babysitting them
all by myself.

422
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,925
Why did my parents
have to get back together?

423
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,511
What were their names?

424
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,890
They go by their nicknames.

425
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,684
Eun-bi and Kka-bi.

426
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,230
Don't you miss him?

427
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,697
I'm all right.

428
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,118
Jo Eun-sup wouldn't remember me anyway.

429
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,751
Here's what you asked me to look into.

430
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:42,349
PERSONNEL FILE
HAEUNDAE POLICE STATION

431
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,786
I'm here.

432
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,287
Hey, man.

433
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,915
I told you not to call me that.

434
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,292
You need to be quick
when your senior calls you.

435
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,254
I'm off today.

436
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,590
Gosh, I really wasn't going to say this.

437
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,758
It's my birthday today.

438
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,969
-I know.
-Really? How do you know?

439
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:19,886
I was forced to.

440
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,599
I got another one of these.
Chief told me to cuff you.

441
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,060
It's not like all offenders hang out
at parking lots.

442
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,062
They can be anywhere.

443
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,858
You called me over on my day off
just to give me this?

444
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,193
No, I wanted to buy you a gift.

445
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,782
You can't take it back.
I'll go pick something, then.

446
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,918
This is Kang Hyeon-min,
Violent Crimes Squad 3.

447
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:06,558
MAY 27, 2022

448
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,282
-Have you eaten yet?
-I have, of course.

449
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,826
-Did you sleep well?
-I sure did.

450
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,787
Hey, you should be asking me
these questions.

451
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,831
Don't you think you should be asking me

452
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,833
if I've been eating and sleeping well?

453
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,170
How I've been eating and sleeping!
And my appeal!

454
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:36,963
Do you not care?

455
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,633
You think cops in the Kingdom
have that much free time?

456
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,885
If you wanted to eat and sleep well,

457
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,345
you, as an assemblywoman,

458
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,389
shouldn't have stolen
the people's tax money like that.

459
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,849
-Hey!
-What?

460
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,646
It's the law that's messed up.

461
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,190
Shouldn't an assemblywoman
receive immunity?

462
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,903
Gosh, this is why
I should've become prime minister.

463
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:00,820
Inmate 5827.

464
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,448
Keep it down in the visitation room.

465
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:08,995
How's Mom doing?

466
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,873
If you have time to visit me,
go take care of Mom.

467
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,959
Be a good daughter yourself.

468
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,586
Take care of her when you're out.

469
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,004
I want to get out...

470
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,341
Get me a new lawyer at once!

471
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,843
-Hire someone expensive.
-Inmate 5827, keep it down!

472
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,055
Gosh.

473
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,226
Can you get me a new correctional officer?

474
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,607
His orders really get on my nerves
for some reason.

475
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,151
I'm all done.

476
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,362
-Be well.
-Hey!

477
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,738
Koo Seo-gyeong!

478
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,035
-Hey, newbie.
-Yes, ma'am.

479
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,122
The NFS called. You left your phone there.

480
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,124
Really? I bought that phone yesterday.

481
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,584
Oh, it's here.

482
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,838
Can I really entrust you
with this important task?

483
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,882
-Is it a case?
-It will be if you don't do this properly.

484
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,219
All right.
Shred all the documents in this box.

485
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:10,265
As for these plastic bottles,
remove the lids and labels

486
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,476
-and recycle them. Go.
-Got it.

487
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,896
By the way, where do you go every weekend?

488
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,690
Why do you ask?

489
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,443
Chief told me to look into it...

490
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:26,281
Gosh, that old man. He's the one
being fishy with that solitude of his.

491
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,243
I go on a trip on weekends. Have fun.

492
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,454
See you later!

493
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,831
Gosh, they're very expensive.

494
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,833
And so many of them.

495
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,211
How could you sell all of them
every single time?

496
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:45,717
Seriously, where have you been going
every weekend?

497
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:50,388
Every single time,
you're not back until dawn.

498
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,892
No matter where that place actually is,
you must call it "the study."

499
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,771
I'll try to sell less buttons this week.

500
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,690
Oh, my head.

501
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,942
Oh, my heart.

502
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,279
If you have to sell them,

503
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,157
sell the ones on your sleeves first.

504
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,578
Keep your jacket buttoned up
since it's cold.

505
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,916
You're getting good at this.

506
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,461
Put it back.

507
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,172
What can I do?

508
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,592
I need to do this
to be able to sleep at night.

509
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,052
Put it back.

510
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,349
All right, fine.

511
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,197
Perhaps Tae-eul's threats worked.

512
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:54,452
Thanks to her, we're doing all the things
that we've skipped.

513
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,540
We even have some know-hows now.

514
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,751
First, we find out what year we're in

515
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:06,423
to make sure
we won't run into our counterparts.

516
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,385
Oh, it's the rotary dial phone,
not the push-button one.

517
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,887
It means it's before 1981, so we're safe.

518
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,431
Let's go.

519
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,271
That's a model from the early 90s.

520
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:22,939
We're fairly safe.

521
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,193
PAY PHONE

522
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,489
I'm not sure about this one.
What year could this be?

523
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,244
Oh, hold on a second.
There are some newspapers.

524
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,876
This is still refreshing.

525
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,754
Your Majesty!

526
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,093
Please leave.

527
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,311
That man recognized me.

528
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,729
Yes, we've got to run.

529
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:06,191
You exist in this world.
Apparently, you're a tyrant here.

530
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:07,942
What?

531
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,323
This is another parallel world.

532
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,242
Lee Gon here must've had
a bad upbringing.

533
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,747
I guess he grew without Lady Noh,
his uncle, and someone's ID card.

534
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,458
He must've been scared and lonely.

535
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,878
Let's go. It's risky to stay
where our counterparts live.

536
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:28,796
Okay.

537
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,843
And that's how we travel together,

538
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,431
although our destinations
are a little extraordinary.

539
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,935
THE NEW MILLENNIUM,
A NEW BEGINNING

540
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,695
"The new millennium"?
It must be the year 2000.

541
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,155
It'd be safe.

542
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,283
Gosh, people thought
the world was going to end in 2000.

543
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,536
We're near Corea University.

544
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,789
Come with me.

545
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:07,210
I know someone who wants to meet
the woman who insists the earth is flat.

546
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,187
By the way, who's the person
that wants to meet me?

547
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,702
Excuse me. Is this yours?

548
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,496
Yes, thank you.

549
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,206
Have a nice day.

550
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,457
Thank you. You too.

551
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,181
Is he

552
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,393
the person who wanted to meet me?

553
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:06,811
Yes.

554
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,022
He met you just now.

555
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,817
He's the uncle who raised me.

556
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,120
But the thing is,

557
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:28,333
the woman who used to insist
that the earth is flat no longer exists.

558
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,461
My earth has become round as well.

559
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,046
Really?

560
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:34,797
Because of me?

561
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,051
As if. Because of gravity, obviously.

562
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,511
And that's the reason
apples fall to the ground.

563
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,014
What else?

564
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,267
It's also what creates tides.

565
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,936
-What else?
-I love you.

566
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:50,688
My goodness.

567
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,525
Why am I startled every time I hear this?

568
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,278
Me too.

569
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,324
By the way, I hope we end up in Joseon

570
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,701
or the late Joseon period next time.

571
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,411
Why that period?

572
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,832
I took a quick look around,
and we've finally come to Joseon.

573
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,000
Where's my hanbok?

574
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,252
Why did you want to travel
to Joseon so much?

575
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,964
I must find my great-grandfather
and tell him

576
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,550
to buy the pear field in Apgujeong
when he's older.

577
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,553
Where's the traditional hairpin?

578
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,353
What is this?

579
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,272
Why did you bring these leaves?

580
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,983
Since we never know where we'll end up.

581
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,153
Based on our experiences so far,
there's no guarantee

582
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,280
we won't end up in that time period.

583
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,161
I mean, the chances are slim,
but we--

584
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,375
We should be prepared.

585
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,046
-It's important.
-Look for my hairpin.

586
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,007
Why would you put that back?

587
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:05,221
BUS STOP
PYEONGCHANG MUNHWA INTERSECTION

588
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,571
Darn it.

589
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,240
I got your ball.

590
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,533
Stay there.

591
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,078
I'll throw it over.

592
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,583
Thank you.

593
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,169
KANG SIN-JAE

594
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,755
PYEONGCHANG-DONG
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 1994

595
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,672
Oh, wait.

596
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,010
Where are you headed?
I'll tell you the bus routes.

597
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,141
There's an accident.

598
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,102
Bye. I've got to run home
and report the accident.

599
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,195
-Hey.
-I got some bus tokens.

600
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,574
What is it? Did something happen?

601
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,410
I think I know why the door brought us

602
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,538
to this time on this day.

603
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:30,139
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, 2022

604
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,560
Hold on a second.

605
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,437
-Here.
-I'm curious.

606
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,524
-They are Eun-bi and Kka-bi.
-I see.

607
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,692
They're already in elementary school.

608
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,611
-They're adorable.
-They look like you.

609
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,404
-You think so?
-Do they?

610
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,323
These were good times.
Do we look alike?

611
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,324
-Well…
-Not really.

612
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,876
Why is he staring at me?

613
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,296
Hold on.

614
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,434
Excuse me. Do I know you?

615
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,729
How are things with you?

616
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,860
Oh, do you work here too?
Which department?

617
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,488
Did you get a driver's license?

618
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,824
Yes, Class 1-special.

619
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,496
Why do I keep answering your questions?
Who are you?

620
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,584
JO EUN-SUP

621
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,169
You're looking good. Confident and strong.

622
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,131
It was nice meeting you.

623
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,509
You'll always be my Unbreakable Sword.

624
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:49,927
What?

625
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:53,806
"The Unbreakable Sword"?

626
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,603
NA-RI NA-RI MYEONG NA-RI

627
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,939
Hi, honey.

628
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:05,401
What? Yes, I had lunch. What about you?

629
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,863
Oh, you're on a diet?

630
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:11,324
Come on. You don't need to lose weight.

631
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,535
Oh, you do?

632
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,914
Then you should've told me.

633
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,751
Every time I see you, I can't believe
you're real because you're so perfect.

634
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,004
Okay, I'll be home soon. Bye.

635
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:27,632
What a lunatic.

636
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:39,644
Wait.

637
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,313
What? Where are we now?

638
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,525
Those are 1,200-lumen flashlights.
The Royal Guards use them.

639
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,364
We came to the same period in the Kingdom.

640
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,158
Gosh. I left just a little while ago.

641
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,577
-Yeong must be looking for me.
-What?

642
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,128
Your Majesty?

643
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,801
The Royal Guards are
to take ten steps back at once.

644
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,721
Yeong, you too.
You guys totally startled me.

645
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,267
I'll take a detour to the palace.

646
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,187
I'll go through the beach
so that no one will see me.

647
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,488
-Your Majesty.
-Yes, Yeong. 

648
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:34,740
It's that situation.

649
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,170
I almost couldn't breathe.

650
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,466
Who's after Yeong?

651
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,552
Who finds out next?

652
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,179
-Lady Noh?
-Lady Noh.

653
01:06:59,056 --> 01:06:59,932
Your Majesty.

654
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,610
The talisman must've worked.

655
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:16,198
I'm letting her use my personal item.
You should know what that means.

656
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,662
I've been wondering

657
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,749
when the Royal Ancestral Shrine
will be completed.

658
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,877
Will it be completed next year?

659
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,217
Drink up. All of it.

660
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:36,927
Will do.

661
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,487
You're the only one who uses this?

662
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:58,074
Of course. But you can use it anytime.

663
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,242
What are you doing?

664
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,079
I shouldn't leave my fingerprints.

665
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,247
Luna lives in this world.

666
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,460
This is very popular in my world.

667
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,882
What about the security footage?

668
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,384
I must've been caught on the cameras.

669
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,428
I'll clear the control tower.

670
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,270
My gosh, talk about tight security.

671
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,024
How do I shut this off?

672
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,029
Look. Isn't that Jo Yeong?

673
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,744
Jeez, him and his temper.

674
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,372
What's he saying?

675
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:53,295
Oh, you're a detective,
so you can probably read lips.

676
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,006
Of course.

677
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,299
Let me see.

678
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,764
Lee.

679
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:05,975
Gon...

680
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:07,977
Son of...

681
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,440
We showed up out of the blue. You know?

682
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:17,987
I'll be upset If Chief Park gives me work
when I'm about to take off.

683
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,780
So what did he say?

684
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,658
Did he call me a dog? Bow-wow?

685
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,787
Yeong? The man I've trusted
since I was four?

686
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,584
Most Royal Guards are science majors.
I can't believe they lost.

687
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,753
He would never do that.

688
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,299
-He doesn't keep any secrets from me.
-My gosh.

689
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,302
What's going on?

690
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,596
Looks like he has a secret.

691
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,683
What genre would this be?
A romantic comedy? A spy film?

692
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,520
Oh, no. Here comes the disrupter.

693
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:56,025
I like this movie. It's already a big hit.

694
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,528
I'm on my toes right now.
This is a thriller.

695
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,739
No, this is a melodrama.

696
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,763
Just like that,
we even watched our own movie.

697
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,568
I don't want to leave.

698
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,531
I'm off.

699
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:47,534
That's it?

700
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,579
I'm late. I have to sprint.

701
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,207
-See you on the weekend.
-Wait.

702
01:10:57,878 --> 01:11:00,464
Why the weekend?
The holidays begin on Wednesday.

703
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,384
Really? That's not the case here.
What holiday?

704
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,303
The King's Birthday.

705
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:08,973
Bye.

706
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:11,809
Be well.

707
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,186
Okay. See you, Lee Gon.

708
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,356
See you, Jeong Tae-eul.

709
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:22,403
We return to our daily lives
after we walk each other to the obelisk

710
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,029
instead of our homes.

711
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:27,616
Stop right there, punk!

712
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,954
Goddamnit!

713
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:45,551
Shit.

714
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:51,765
You see, I have a lot of respect for those
who try to change the future.

715
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:54,727
But it'd be better for you
to just get caught now,

716
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,104
if you want to be able to walk
to the station.

717
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,230
In your dreams.

718
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,442
Climb over the wall,
starting with the one in the back!

719
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:02,359
Hey, move it.

720
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,236
What? Who's that prick?

721
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,113
-Who is he?
-Hi.

722
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,784
I'm Jang Michael
from Violent Crimes Unit Three of Jongno.

723
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,661
-Damn it.
-You bastards.

724
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,371
Jeez.

725
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,962
Jangmi, easy.

726
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,715
We have to carry them now.
Hey, newbie. Hurry.

727
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,467
I'm Lieutenant Jeong from Jongno.

728
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:32,014
You are under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

729
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,059
I accept the people's wishes,

730
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,812
and allow Prime Minister Mo
to form the cabinet.

731
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,490
I will do my very best, Your Majesty.
Put your trust in me.

732
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,283
I always have.

733
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:55,329
I'll keep my ears open
and support you any way I can.

734
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:59,875
I will be a prime minister
who mostly gives written reports.

735
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,629
I'd prefer an in-person report every week.

736
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,590
You can't possibly expect
a weekly report in person…

737
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,719
Then let's have it half and half.

738
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,602
What are you doing, Mom?
Are you receiving an award?

739
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,854
Well...

740
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:24,691
I had to bring him
because I couldn't find a babysitter.

741
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:28,278
Who are you, mister?

742
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:33,492
Nice to meet you.

743
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,578
I am the king of the Kingdom of Corea.

744
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,540
My name is Lee Gon.

745
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,615
-Get your newspapers here!
-Come take a look.

746
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,868
-Have a look!
-Get your newspapers here!

747
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,163
Newspapers!

748
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:24,293
-Get your newspapers here!
-Come and have a look!

749
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:30,966
BAREFOOTED YOUTH

750
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,634
SHOWING TODAY

751
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:38,682
No matter what kind of a door opens
before us in life...

752
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,977
And even if the moments we share

753
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,897
make us sad at times,

754
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,109
-I wish to love tirelessly.
-I wish to love tirelessly.

755
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:54,948
Just like that,

756
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,703
we decided to love the fate that chose us.

757
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,630
Just for today

758
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,798
and only today.

759
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,469
And forever.

760
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,707
