19
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,340
(Xianling Pavilion)

20
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,100
Look.

21
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,180
The lines here flow very nicely.

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,500
Shiyi, you are here.

23
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,300
Teacher.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,060
Go back and practice first.

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,020
Let's go there and talk.

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,380
Okay.

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,580
Here, take a seat.

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,220
In your letter

29
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,700
you said that you had settled
the refugees.

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,100
So I came here to take a look.

31
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,100
I

32
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,820
took your advice last time.

33
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,460
I worked with the other
embroidery workshops

34
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,420
and took in the female refugees.

35
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,820
In that case,

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,500
I can teach them embroidery,

37
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,780
and they don't have to worry

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,620
about their future livelihood.

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,220
You are such a kind person.

40
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,460
With your help,

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,740
you will bring warmth and hope

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,420
in this flood disaster.

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,220
How about you?

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,020
Do you still have time for embroidery?

45
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,860
There are too many chores at home.

46
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,180
I hardly have time for embroidery now.

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,700
I thought so as much.

48
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,660
That's why

49
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,740
I called you

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,020
here today.

51
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,180
You see,

52
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,660
after we took in these women,

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,860
Xianling Pavilion

54
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,780
suddenly became crowded.

55
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,900
Those embroidery girls

56
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,460
have to teach them embroidery skills

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
while taking care of the business.

58
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,420
It makes them very busy.

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,060
So I'm wondering

60
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
if you'll have time

61
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,940
to teach them embroidery.

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,140
Of course I'd love to.

63
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,980
And

64
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,380
I've been thinking about

65
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,580
how I can help them.

66
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,100
But I haven't found a way.

67
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,220
I'm very glad

68
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,380
you give me this opportunity.

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,580
But

70
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,420
your identity is different now.

71
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,900
You should think about

72
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,580
if it'll be convenient for you.

73
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Teacher, don't worry.

74
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,420
I don't have any problem.

75
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,340
Your Ladyship,

76
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,980
no one will tell who you are

77
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,340
when you are dressed like this.

78
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,980
Your Ladyship,

79
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,020
if Xianling Pavilion is shorthanded,

80
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,020
they can hire more embroidery girls.

81
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,180
I'm afraid Great Madam will get upset

82
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,060
if she finds out that you
show yourself in public.

83
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,380
Besides, there are so many refugees.

84
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,820
If anyone recognizes you

85
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,860
and spreads the news...

86
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,020
Amber,

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,300
you really think

88
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,100
Master Jian asked me to help her

89
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,980
because she's shorthanded?

90
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,780
Doesn't she?

91
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,460
She hopes

92
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,140
that I'll keep

93
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,860
my hobby and dream in mind

94
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,780
while looking for the killer.

95
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,460
That's very considerate of her.

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,500
Master Jian has been seeing Her Ladyship

97
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,060
as her own daughter.

98
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,060
And

99
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,900
why can't women

100
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,380
show themselves in public?

101
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,740
We don't steal or rob,

102
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,900
and we harm no one.

103
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,780
There's nothing to be shamed about.

104
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,700
I believe you've all

105
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,540
mastered flat stitch.

106
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,780
Next, I'll teach you loop stitch.

107
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,020
Loop stitch is the main skill

108
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,100
used in Suzhou embroidery.

109
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,820
There are various stitch layouts.

110
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,540
You need to be flexible when you do

111
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,020
connect and border stitches.

112
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,540
Switch between short and long stitches

113
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,180
and go back and forth.

114
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,060
Like this.

115
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,940
Look.

116
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,300
You won't see any knots in this way.

117
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,380
Lady Luo.

118
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,540
Mr. Lin.

119
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,060
Long time no see.

120
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
I didn't expect

121
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,900
to meet you here today.

122
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,500
It's such a wonderful surprise.

123
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,100
I thought I'd never

124
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,300
see you again.

125
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,900
I can't believe that

126
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,380
we meet here today.

127
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,100
I'd come to Xianling Pavilion
to teach them

128
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,300
embroidery once in a while.

129
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,180
And I hope that they can support

130
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,620
themselves after the disaster.

131
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,500
You are not only good at embroidery,

132
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,820
but also kind-hearted.

133
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,020
I'm so impressed.

134
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,900
You are flattering me.

135
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,780
Lady Luo,

136
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,340
I've always wanted

137
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,740
to ask you a question.

138
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,860
We had an appointment a year ago

139
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,260
to meet at Ci'an Temple

140
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,620
and then leave the capital together.

141
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,260
But you never came.

142
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,700
Did anything come up

143
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,500
and stop you

144
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,220
or you just changed your mind?

145
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,820
I had a family emergency that day.

146
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,260
So I couldn't meet you.

147
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,140
Sorry that I failed

148
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,620
in notifying you in time.

149
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,860
Never mind.

150
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,140
I was just worried about you.

151
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,140
Now that I see you are fine,

152
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm relieved.

153
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,940
How have you been recently?

154
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,620
Do you still want to leave the capital?

155
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,540
Thank you for your care.

156
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,020
I've settled down in
the capital actually.

157
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,340
And I do enjoy my life here.

158
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,980
I'm not planning on leaving.

159
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,580
Mr. Lin.

160
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,540
Teacher.

161
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,340
Master Jian.

162
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,700
Mr. Lin, don't mind the formality.

163
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,420
Take a seat.

164
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,340
Sir.

165
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,660
It's you.

166
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,420
You know each other?

167
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,140
Your lady...

168
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,700
My Lady, you may not know.

169
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,020
It's this sir

170
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,700
who helped us

171
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,940
purchase the rice for disaster relief.

172
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,780
Not only that,

173
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,660
Mr. Lin

174
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,420
also invested in Xianling Pavilion.

175
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,260
After learning that
I took in the refugees,

176
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,260
he even donated

177
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,340
a great amount of fabrics,
needles and threads.

178
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,460
Turns out Mr. Lin

179
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,180
is also the owner of Xianling Pavilion.

180
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,860
Sorry I didn't know that.

181
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,300
No worries.

182
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,820
I really admire Master Jian

183
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,300
for her desire of passing down
the embroidery skills.

184
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,580
And I also want to do my part.

185
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,900
Mr. Lin, thank you

186
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,420
for helping my teacher.

187
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,300
And thank you

188
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,220
for your generous donation.

189
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,260
Supporting disaster relief

190
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,820
is what I should do.

191
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,820
Besides,

192
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,780
Xianling Pavilion's matter is mine.

193
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,460
No need to thank me.

194
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,460
(Mansion of Xu)

195
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,380
My Lord.

196
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,340
What do you need me for?

197
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,660
This is...

198
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,860
Don't ask.

199
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,140
Go get a few

200
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,900
trustworthy people to take care of him.

201
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,580
Then we can only keep him

202
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,700
at your place for now.

203
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,220
There are too many eyes
in the Western Lateral Court.

204
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm afraid it'd be inconvenient.

205
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,620
Okay.

206
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,860
Don't tell anybody else.

207
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,740
My Lord, what's his name?

208
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,100
How should we call him?

209
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,740
Fengqing.

210
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,100
I'll ask Dongqing and Amber

211
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,060
to take care of him.

212
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,100
They will keep it a secret.

213
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,460
Okay.

214
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,460
Your Ladyship,

215
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,220
who's this kid?

216
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,940
Don't ask me.

217
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,180
I know nothing about it.

218
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,460
This kid

219
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,260
looks a little bit

220
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,020
like His Lordship.

221
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,500
Is he His Lordship's...

222
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,620
Nonsense.

223
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,820
Your job is to take care of him.

224
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,620
And

225
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,380
do not tell anybody else about this.

226
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,300
-Yes.
-Yes.

227
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
Madam, bad news.

228
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,620
What happened? Calm down.

229
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,220
I heard the servants said

230
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,820
His Lordship has a bastard outside.

231
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,980
He just brought him home.

232
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,980
What?

233
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,660
Is it true?

234
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,940
Yes, it is.

235
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,940
Did you see that kid in person?

236
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,740
He's at Banyuepan right now.

237
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,220
I just sneaked a peek.

238
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,980
Although I didn't see a kid,

239
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,660
I did see some kid's stuff there.

240
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,060
Madam.

241
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,420
Who will keep the kid
in the future then?

242
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,100
Her Ladyship?

243
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,500
It's not decided yet.

244
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,260
But nothing is for sure.

245
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,620
It's bad. It's really bad.

246
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,900
A son like Zhun is not enough.

247
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,260
If Her Ladyship has another son,

248
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,100
Yu's future will

249
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,460
be totally ruined.

250
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,180
That's right.

251
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,820
Shiliu.

252
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,700
Shiliu, where are you going?

253
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,380
I think you've heard it, too.

254
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,020
His Lordship brought back a child.

255
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,140
I'm on my way to take a look.

256
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,820
It's said

257
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,580
the kid looks quite like His Lordship.

258
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,260
Why are you so happy

259
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,460
that His Lordship brought
back a bastard?

260
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,060
I don't think your words are proper.

261
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,820
If others hear you,

262
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,780
they'll think

263
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,220
you don't like the kid.

264
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,340
I didn't mean that.

265
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,580
Sure.

266
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,220
We live in the same yard

267
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,620
and we are together all the time.

268
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,740
Of course I won't misunderstand you.

269
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,420
But it doesn't mean others wouldn't.

270
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,820
You should be

271
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,420
careful about what you say.

272
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,260
She doesn't talk much usually.

273
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,260
But what she said just now

274
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,900
is really annoying.

275
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,500
Brother.

276
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,100
Have a seat.

277
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,220
What brings you here?

278
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,380
I heard

279
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,820
that the Marquis has a bastard.

280
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,500
Who told you that?

281
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,340
And what did you hear exactly?

282
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm afraid the news has spread

283
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,180
to all the nobles in the capital.

284
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,660
The Marquis has brought

285
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,700
the kid back.

286
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,380
Do you know about that?

287
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,420
Shiyi,

288
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,300
if Great Madam and the Marquis

289
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,620
are all willing to accept

290
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,020
the kid as a family member,

291
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,660
what will you do?

292
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,020
I will listen

293
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,740
to Great Madam and His Lordship.

294
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,220
My dear Shiyi,

295
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,780
you are indeed sensible.

296
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,540
But there's one thing

297
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,100
that you can't agree
with no matter what.

298
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
You mean...

299
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,700
It's understandable that the Marquis

300
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,420
brought the kid home.

301
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,220
But if they ask you

302
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,660
to raise the kid,

303
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,500
he'll be considered
as the legitimate son.

304
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,180
But you are still young.

305
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,100
You'll have your own kid in the future.

306
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,660
You can't let him

307
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,740
replace the status of your own child.

308
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,300
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

309
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,580
But such an important matter

310
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,260
should be decided by His Lordship.

311
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,460
Even though taking in a bastard

312
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,540
shall be approved by the legal wife,

313
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,580
the Marquis

314
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,620
has made up his mind.

315
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,700
If you don't agree,

316
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,180
it'll affect your relationship

317
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,500
with him.

318
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,060
In my opinion,

319
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,060
we should let

320
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,100
Concubine Qin take him.

321
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,380
I remember Yuanniang once told me

322
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,060
that she's nice and easy-going.

323
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

324
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I'll keep it in mind.

325
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,780
Alright,

326
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,300
that's all

327
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,900
I've got to say to you.

328
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,740
I'll go back after greeting the Marquis.

329
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Take care.

330
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,060
Your Ladyship,

331
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,740
your brother cares about you so much.

332
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,260
He's really a nice person.

333
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,020
He is honest and upright.

334
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,500
Before I got married,

335
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,060
we didn't talk often.

336
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,780
But

337
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,900
he always cares about me.

338
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,220
And he's quite competitive

339
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,500
in study.

340
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,340
I guess the future of Luo family

341
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,660
will count on him.

342
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,580
My Lord, rest assured.

343
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,980
I will take good care of the kid.

344
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
But

345
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,540
we made this decision

346
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,860
without even notifying Lingkuan,

347
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,300
I'm afraid it'd be quite awkward

348
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,460
when Danyang finds out.

349
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,620
Who told you

350
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,180
it's Lingkuan's child?

351
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,700
I saw that kid is weak and pale,

352
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,500
and his clothes are dirty and worn out.

353
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,140
If he were your kid,

354
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,340
no matter what

355
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,940
you would take care of him

356
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,820
and wouldn't let him suffer.

357
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,140
Fengqing is indeed Lingkuan's child.

358
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,900
He was born before Lingkuan

359
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,620
and Danyang got married.

360
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,380
But

361
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,420
one more kid suddenly
appears in the mansion.

362
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,900
I'm afraid we can't keep
this secret for long.

363
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,140
And Danyang is pregnant now.

364
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,700
We can't let her

365
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,460
have any accident.

366
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,780
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

367
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,460
You've seen how Fengqing

368
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,500
looks like.

369
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,100
How can I leave him outside alone

370
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,140
and let him starve every day?

371
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,300
Besides,

372
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,300
this thing is not that simple.

373
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,940
It involves many factors.

374
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,260
My Lord, you mean

375
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,700
Marquis Dingnan?

376
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,140
No matter what,

377
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,100
we should keep it from Danyang

378
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,820
and let her give birth first.

379
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,980
How

380
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,940
are you so sure

381
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,460
that I'm not that kid's father?

382
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,540
My Lord, you are

383
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,060
proud and ambitious.

384
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,580
It could be possible

385
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,260
if you were interested in a lady

386
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
of a prominent family.

387
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
However,

388
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,100
A lady of the prominent family wouldn't

389
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,540
let her own child suffer like that.

390
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,980
Plus, that kid does

391
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,820
look like Xu family's.

392
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,500
So he can only be Lingkuan's child.

393
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,940
During the Spring Banquet,

394
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,460
there was a play in Dianchun Hall,

395
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,100
so I took a rest in Jing'an Pavilion.

396
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,220
I didn't know

397
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,980
Lianfang was changing there.

398
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,140
Yuanniang walked in

399
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,860
before I could get out.

400
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,860
And then,

401
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,220
you know what happened later.

402
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,220
You don't believe me?

403
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,900
It's okay if you don't.

404
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,300
Why don't I believe you?

405
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,980
My Lord, you are the one

406
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,460
who defeated bandits and marched out
for battles in southeastern region.

407
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,260
As a decent man,

408
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,900
you wouldn't lie to me at all.

409
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,460
But

410
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,860
it's my fault after all.

411
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,700
When my brother
and father died,

412
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,500
Lingkuan was still a kid.

413
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,620
I was out there
fighting battles all the time.

414
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,860
I seldom came back home,

415
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,940
so I failed in teaching and guiding him.

416
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,620
Mother spoiled him a lot,

417
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,540
so gradually, he became

418
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,860
a playboy who only cared about

419
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,060
having fun.

420
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,180
I was so worried about him,

421
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,740
so I treated him
very harshly and strictly.

422
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,860
As a result,

423
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,500
he became terrified of me.

424
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,580
When he made trouble,

425
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,460
all he could think about was

426
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,540
hiding it from me

427
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,100
instead of discussing it with me.

428
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,820
My Lord, it's not too late

429
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,140
for you to make a change now.

430
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,380
As long as you are willing
to make a change,

431
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,220
I'm sure

432
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,940
Lingkuan will feel that.

433
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,540
Lingyi,

434
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,340
Kuan'er is here.

435
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,420
Tell us what's going on.

436
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,740
Kneel before Mother.

437
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,820
What are you doing?

438
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,300
Mother,

439
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,060
do you still remember

440
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,620
that lady named Yuemei?

441
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,340
She's the actor's sister.

442
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,860
Kuan'er,

443
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,340
are you still seeing her?

444
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,700
Mother, don't get me wrong.

445
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,940
Ever since I got married

446
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,260
with Danyang four years ago,

447
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,860
I've never seen her again.

448
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,380
I know you stopped seeing her.

449
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,740
But do you know

450
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,980
she was pregnant with your child?

451
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,060
And now, Yuemei

452
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,220
and her brother are requesting

453
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,580
to meet you the child's father.

454
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,980
Child?

455
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,340
Who's the child?

456
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,020
Where's the child?

457
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,980
They sent the child here yesterday.

458
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,740
He's at my place right now

459
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,380
and under the care of Shiyi.

460
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,340
I'll go check on him.

461
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,060
Stop.

462
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,300
Now you want

463
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,860
to be a father?

464
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,060
It's too late.

465
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,380
Where have you been for all these years?

466
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,140
Although Yuemei is a low life,

467
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,860
she's not a prostitute.

468
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,820
How can you be so irresponsible?

469
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,180
It's not something

470
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,500
a decent man would do.

471
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,060
I...

472
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,620
It's not his fault.

473
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm the one who sent her away.

474
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,700
That day,

475
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,220
she and her brother

476
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,980
came to the mansion and asked for money.

477
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,460
They said they'd ruin

478
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,060
Kuan'er's marriage
if they didn't get paid.

479
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,180
I think

480
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,180
it's a mistake that Kuan'er made,

481
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,780
so I gave them a lot of money

482
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,540
and sent them away.

483
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,300
I didn't know

484
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,460
that she was pregnant.

485
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,620
At this point,

486
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,300
it's too late to do anything.

487
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,620
The most important thing

488
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
is that Danyang will give birth soon.

489
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,420
We've got to keep it from her.

490
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,660
Mother,

491
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
I'm going

492
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,580
to keep this kid in my name.

493
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,700
Lingyi.

494
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,780
No matter what,

495
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,060
I can't let this kid

496
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,340
suffer anymore.

497
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,500
Besides, it's quite obvious

498
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,180
that this kid looks like
our Xu family's.

499
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,300
Danyang will find out

500
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,940
sooner or later.

501
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,780
This is

502
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,140
the only way

503
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,980
to protect their marriage.

504
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,300
Has Shiyi agreed?

505
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,180
Then this is the best we can do.

506
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,580
But she's never had any child before.

507
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,380
How about this?

508
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,220
I'll send my Nanny Huang

509
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,460
to help her take care of him.

510
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,100
You are indeed thoughtful, Mother.

511
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,980
Go check on your kid.

512
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,020
His name is Fengqing.

513
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,300
What is it, Your Ladyship?

514
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,860
Is there anything wrong?

515
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,060
Dongqing, take a look.

516
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,900
Which color

517
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
do you think I should use

518
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,220
for this spot?

519
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,780
Purple or brown?

520
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,820
Which one do you think

521
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,420
His Lordship would prefer?

522
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,340
I think purple is better.

523
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,660
And it represents "auspicious
purple mist coming from the east."

524
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
It'll bring him luck.

525
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,180
I think so.

526
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,220
His Lordship is calm and stable.

527
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,220
His clothes are all in dark colors.

528
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,460
Purple is brighter than brown.

529
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,660
It'd be a nice change for him.

530
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,460
Your Ladyship, Concubine Qin is here.

531
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,100
Shiliu.

532
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,060
Your Ladyship.

533
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,860
What's going on? Please stand up.

534
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,580
Your Ladyship.

535
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,660
I hope you can let me

536
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,060
take care of Fengqing.

537
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,980
I promise I'll do my best

538
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,900
and treat him as my own child.

539
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,300
Please stand up first.

540
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,780
Your Ladyship,

541
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,940
I won't stand up unless you say yes.

542
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,620
As you know,

543
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,740
I had a miscarriage before.

544
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,700
The physician said

545
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,940
I wouldn't be able

546
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,940
to get pregnant ever again.

547
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,020
My room has always been quiet.

548
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,860
If I have a child to take care of,

549
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,180
then I'll have a hope

550
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,940
for the rest of my life.

551
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,820
Your Ladyship,

552
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,780
I'd love to do anything

553
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,940
as long as you say yes.

554
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,380
Please let me have him.

555
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,140
Shiliu,

556
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,780
I understand your feelings.

557
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,300
I will talk to His Lordship.

558
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,740
But

559
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,820
we still have to listen

560
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,340
to His Lordship and Great Madam.

561
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,940
Please stand up.

562
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,220
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

563
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,220
Rest assured.

564
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,380
I will treat Fengqing

565
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,460
as my own child.

566
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,540
I won't let him get hurt whatsoever.

567
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,300
So,

568
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,300
you want to raise Fengqing?

569
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,100
Great Madam, I hope you can agree.

570
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,820
Fengqing is so little,

571
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,060
and you've never taken care of
children before.

572
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,700
You should know

573
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,500
that it'll take a lot of energy

574
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,260
and patience out of you.

575
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,220
Passion alone is not enough.

576
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,540
Great Madam, don't worry.

577
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,500
I promise I will treat Fengqing
as my own child.

578
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,980
And I'll hire two

579
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,340
experienced nannies

580
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,580
to help me take care of him.

581
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,860
I promise I won't let
Fengqing get hurt.

582
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,580
Lianfang,

583
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,620
you are still young.

584
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,180
You'll have your own
child sooner or later.

585
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,100
If you really have such energy,

586
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,300
you should

587
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,620
use it to serve Lingyi well.

588
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,060
I also want to serve him well.

589
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,380
But as you know,

590
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,180
he hardly sets foot in my place.

591
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Especially

592
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,340
after the moldy rice incident.

593
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,460
If I have Fengqing with me,

594
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,260
he may come visit me more.

595
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,060
I know

596
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,540
my motivation is not

597
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,020
quite pure,

598
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,060
but

599
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,140
I promise I will treat
Fengqing very well.

600
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,180
I really

601
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,780
don't know what to do.

602
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,860
As long as His Lordship

603
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,620
is willing to take a look at me,

604
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,340
I'd love to do anything.

605
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,780
My kid,

606
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,660
sorry that it's been difficult for you.

607
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,780
I know now.

608
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,540
I will think about this.

609
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,580
Thank you, Great Madam.

610
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,380
I called all of you here today

611
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,300
to discuss about

612
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,980
Fengqing's matter.

613
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,940
Yizhen,

614
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,740
I called you here

615
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,380
so that you can

616
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,340
help them to figure out a way.

617
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,980
Yes, Mother.

618
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,380
My Lord,

619
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,540
when I visited Fengqing yesterday,

620
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,500
he cried so hard
and asked for his mother.

621
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,340
So,

622
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,940
how about today?

623
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,060
Yizhen, no worries.

624
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,300
He's getting used to it already.

625
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,340
That's good.

626
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,060
Mother,

627
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,740
who do you think

628
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,140
should take care

629
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,300
of Fengqing?

630
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,140
Yizhen, what do you think?

631
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,060
Concubine Qiao is young.

632
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,820
Concubine Qin is meticulous.

633
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,540
They are both good in different ways.

634
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,140
But in my opinion,

635
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,500
it's a great responsibility
to take care of a child.

636
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,620
It's easy to make mistakes

637
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,180
if you don't have enough energy.

638
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,660
So I think

639
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Concubine Qiao is more suitable.

640
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,220
I also think

641
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,620
Concubine Qiao is the best fit.

642
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,140
She's educated,

643
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,900
mild and kind.

644
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,300
I couldn't feel more relieved

645
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,980
if she takes care of Fengqing.

646
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,740
Mother.

647
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,180
Lianfang

648
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,940
is spoiled herself.

649
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,740
She's never taken care of anybody.

650
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,340
I don't think it's proper
to let her take care of Fengqing.

651
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,500
So, you...

652
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,340
Mother,

653
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,180
I think Concubine Qin is more suitable.

654
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,780
She's calm and stable,

655
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,180
and she's good at taking care of people.

656
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,300
Even if the child acts up,

657
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,980
she'll know how to handle it.

658
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,100
Concubine Qin is

659
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,420
a good candidate.

660
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,940
Raising a child

661
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,140
is not a simple matter.

662
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,300
The mother's
personality matters too.

663
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,660
If the mother and the child
don't get along in the future,

664
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,700
that'll be a big trouble.

665
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,620
How about...

666
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,780
How about this?

667
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,740
Let them both

668
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
spend some time with the kid,

669
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,940
and see who gets along better with him.

670
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,140
And then we'll make a decision.

671
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,940
Lingyi, what do you think?

672
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:47,980
Okay.

673
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,820
It's a good idea, Mother.

674
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,020
(Xianling Pavilion)

675
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,020
This looks pretty good.

676
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,580
(Delicate Meticulousness)

677
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,220
Mr. Lin, you are here.

678
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,860
Master Jian.

679
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,780
Master Jian, don't worry about me.

680
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,260
I'll just take a look around.

681
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,700
Sure.

682
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,980
Is Lady Luo here today?

683
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,140
I think she has things to do at home.

684
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,100
She hasn't come here

685
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,260
for days.

686
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,620
Master Jian,
you are close with Lady Luo.

687
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,060
Do you know which family she's from?

688
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,460
(I'd better not tell him)

689
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,980
(that Shiyi)

690
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,580
(is Marquis Yongping's wife.)

691
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,620
(In case someone
with bad intention hears it)

692
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,460
(and makes trouble for no reason.)

693
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,660
I don't know about that.

694
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,260
I guess she's from an ordinary family.

695
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,220
Master Jian, please take a look at this.

696
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,260
Okay.

697
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,940
Mr. Lin, please excuse me for a while.

698
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,380
Let's go.

699
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,540
(Xianling Pavilion)

700
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,700
Excuse me,

701
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,900
could you do me a favor?

702
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,940
Mr. Lin, what do you need?

703
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,260
When Lady Luo is here,

704
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,500
please notify me,

705
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,340
okay?

706
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,100
Sure. Sure.

707
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,860
Sure.

708
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,540
Although Her Ladyship accepted Fengqing,

709
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,300
she'd more or less

710
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,420
felt a little sad.

711
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,820
But I can see

712
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,740
that she treats Fengqing

713
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,100
with her whole heart.

714
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,460
It's really not easy for her.

715
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
She knew it right away

716
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,380
that Fengqing isn't my child.

717
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,900
How did she know?

718
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,660
Come again.

719
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Do you want it?

720
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,540
I want one...

721
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,460
Perfume sachets.

722
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,660
Perfume sachets.

723
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
Come and take a look.

724
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Beautiful perfume sachets.

725
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,100
Young Master,

726
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,380
why do you always

727
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,700
check out the girly stuff?

728
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,820
Are you going

729
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,220
to buy one for Lady Luo?

730
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,860
You know too much.

731
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,580
She's selfless,

732
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,980
so she won't be blinded

733
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,900
by power and desire.

734
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,380
She won't misunderstand me
like Yuanniang would.

735
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,220
Shiyi trusts me.

736
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,980
She understands me
even if I don't say anything.

737
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,380
I misunderstood her before.

738
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,780
My Lord, you and Her Ladyship

739
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,020
know each other so well.

740
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,380
So tell me,

741
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,660
what can I do

742
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,220
to make her happy?

743
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,020
Young Master,

744
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,820
you finally admit

745
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,860
that you like her.

746
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,820
I made her

747
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
suffer too much before.

748
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,340
Even if she doesn't complain,

749
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,540
I'll make it up to her.

750
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
What do you think

751
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,820
she'll like?

752
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,180
Lady Luo is kind, outgoing

753
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
and smart.

754
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,900
It's normal that I fall for her.

755
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,260
Young Master,

756
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
why do you go through all the trouble?

757
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,220
You should just pack some money,
go to Luo family

758
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,460
and directly propose to her.

759
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,620
With all the time
you waste on pondering,

760
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,460
you could have married her already.

761
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,860
What do you know?

762
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,020
My Lord, if you want
to give Her Ladyship a gift,

763
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,380
just say it directly.

764
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,020
You don't need to beat around the bush.

765
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,180
When I mentioned about
Imperial Censor Liu​'s daughter last time...

766
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,420
I suggest we send her

767
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,700
some jewelries,

768
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,140
which are expensive and appropriate.

769
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,260
It can never go wrong.

770
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:55,980
It won't work.

771
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,340
She doesn't like those things.

772
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,420
Give me another idea.

773
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,380
My Lord, please cut me some slack.

774
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,540
How can mutual love

775
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,020
be bought by money?

776
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,580
It's so tacky.

777
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,020
If I followed your idea,

778
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,060
I'd scare her away.

779
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,340
Young Master, it makes sense.

780
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,340
(Shuangshun Ready-made Clothes Store)

781
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,420
Madam, watch out for the steps.

782
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
What's wrong?

783
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,220
There are cracks on the steps.

784
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,700
Her Ladyship has asked
servants to repair them.

785
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,260
The weather is damp,

786
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,700
I'm afraid it'll take days

787
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,980
for the concrete to dry.

788
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,620
That's why I gave you a heads-up,

789
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,900
in case you'll slip.

790
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,620
Madam,

791
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,340
Her Ladyship is not in the room.

792
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,260
She and Fengqing

793
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,460
are at Banyuepan.

794
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,420
Fengqing.

795
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,700
Fengqing.

796
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,660
(Xu Sijie)

797
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,740
Fengqing. Play this.

798
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,980
This is called Lu Ban Ball.

799
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,100
It's really fun.

800
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,020
Try it.

801
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,220
Fengqing.

802
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,220
Fengqing. Slow down.

803
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,460
He's too little

804
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,060
to play this.

805
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,940
Fengqing.

806
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,820
Look.

807
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,940
Do you like this?

808
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,020
It's a red-tasselled spear.

809
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,100
Greetings to you.

810
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,140
Fengqing

811
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,540
is such a lively boy.

812
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,900
Fengqing,

813
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,940
don't hurt people

814
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,340
with the spear.

815
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,780
Fengqing

816
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,940
is just playing with me.

817
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,780
It's okay. Go ahead and have fun.

818
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,980
Be careful.

819
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,460
Are you okay?

820
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,540
Do you get hurt?

821
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,100
Shiliu, are you alright?

822
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,220
I'm fine.

823
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,060
Is Fengqing alright?

824
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,300
Who brought this spear?

825
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,180
My Lord, I did.

826
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,020
But I didn't know

827
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,860
that it'd hurt people.

828
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,180
Take it away.

829
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,700
Luckily no one gets hurt.

830
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,340
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

831
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,500
Fengqing, are you hungry?

832
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,980
Would you like to have some pastries?

833
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,260
Or how about

834
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,420
we play ball in the garden?

835
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,780
Why did you

836
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,340
buy such a toy?

837
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,380
And now

838
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,540
His Lordship will never allow me

839
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,540
to raise Fengqing.

840
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,220
It's all because of that peddler.

841
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,340
He strongly recommended it

842
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,940
and said all boys love it.

843
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,740
I bought it without even thinking.

844
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,820
Peddler?

845
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,300
With which store?

846
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,260
It's just

847
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,180
a street peddler.

848
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,860
I happened to see him

849
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,620
when I went out the other day,

850
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,220
so I bought one.

851
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,260
You are so stupid.

852
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,540
I think it was a trap.

853
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,220
There's no such coincidence.

854
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,940
A trap?

855
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,620
I bet it's Luo Shiyi

856
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,380
who sets us up

857
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,660
since I threaten her power.

858

♪Moisten the brush
