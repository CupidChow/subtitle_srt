The embroidery girls

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
are getting better and better
with embroidery

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,860
and the embroidery patterns

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
are getting more and more ingenious.

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,200
Indeed.

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,880
You look

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,480
much healthier now.

Yes.

I trust that everyone has a soft spot.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,360
Your kindness to them

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
will be reciprocated eventually.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,640
By the way, teacher

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,880
I've made a new discovery

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,040
about my mother.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,160
Go ahead.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,160
I found

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,720
Young Madam Ou's cuff pattern

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,200
to be similar to the pattern

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,520
on the fabric

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
that day.

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Young Madam Ou?

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,680
Why is the Ou family

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,040
related to this?

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
I don't know why.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
But I want to continue investigating

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,480
no matter how slim the hope is.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,200
I want to look for clues
in the Mansion of Ou.

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,200
But

54
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll catch their attention

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,640
if I visit them rashly.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
What do you plan to do?

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,080
Since you've brought this up,

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,720
you must have already formed a plan.

59
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,080
I heard

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
they invited you over

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
to pick embroidery patterns.

62
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,040
Yes, they did.

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,800
Do you mean...

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,000
Master Jian, you're finally here.

67
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,600
Young Madam is waiting for you.

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,400
This way.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,560
Vice Minister Ou's room

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,960
is right ahead.

71
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,600
Oh no.

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,080
I left an embroidery sample
in the carriage.

73
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,240
You're so careless.

74
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,360
Go fetch it.

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,400
You need to hurry up.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,440
It's alright.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,760
We can go there first.

78
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,320
Young Madam.

79
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,720
Master Jian is here.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
Greetings, Young Madam Ou.

81
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,280
When I heard that Master Jian

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,560
of Xianling Pavilion

83
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,960
has extraordinary skills,

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,880
I thought they

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
were exaggerating.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,240
But then I

87
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,400
saw the embroidered wrap

88
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
you made for Madam Ning,

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,320
and I realized you live up

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
to your reputation.

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you for the compliment.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,200
I feel greatly honored.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,720
I invited you here

94
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
to pick some unique embroidery patterns

95
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,880
so I could have a few new outfits made.

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,680
Did you come here alone?

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,160
An embroidery girl came with her, but
she left to fetch the embroidery sample.

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
Master Jian, spare the formality.

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,040
Take a seat.

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,560
Yes.

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Young Madam Ou, Master Jian.

102
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,560
The embroidery samples are here.

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,760
You may take a look.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,640
It's so beautiful.

105
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,040
I've asked around
to gather information.

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
Marquis Jingyuan and Ou Lixing

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,040
won't be in the Mansion of Ou

108
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,800
on the day I visit Young Madam Ou

109
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,960
to show her the embroidery samples.

110
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
We need someone

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,040
to cooperate with us

112
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,800
to make the plan work.

113
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,080
I'll arrange a maid

114
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,360
to dress like you.

115
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,440
She'll bring the embroidery samples

116
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,080
at a later time.

117
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,500
(On the Rise)

118
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,840
Tomorrow is the birthday

119
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,600
of Official Zhao from
the Ministry of Personnel.

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,040
Prepare a present.

121
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes.

122
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,520
It's me.

123
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,600
This is not a good place to stay.

124
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Go.

125
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,780
(The Picture of Emperor Wu
of Han's Spring Outing)

126
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,840
Lady Luo.

127
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,180
(On the Rise)

128
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,200
Thank you for helping me.

129
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,600
But why

130
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,360
are you in the Mansion of Ou?

131
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,960
My birth name is Ou Yanxing.

132
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,880
I'm the illegitimate son in this family.

133
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
Lin is my mother's surname.

134
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,840
I do business outside home all the time

135
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,800
and I have no wish to take advantage of
the Ou family's clout.

136
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,440
So I adopted the alias Lin Shixian.

137
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,760
I see.

138
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

139
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,240
It's just...

140
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,880
It's just that I had a dispute
with my father

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
over my mother's death back in the day.

142
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,800
Then I left the Ou family.

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
I rarely come back.

144
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,720
I just went to Xianling Pavilion

145
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,600
and heard that you and Master Jian

146
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,320
had come here.

147
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
So I came to have a look.

148
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,720
But I don't understand

149
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,120
why you snuck into
my brother's room.

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,560
I got lost.

151
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,520
I saw you clearly

152
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,360
and you didn't look lost

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,600
to me.

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,200
It's just that my clothes

155
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,920
got a little messy.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,560
So I looked for a room to tidy up.

157
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,440
I didn't know

158
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,240
that was your brother's room.

159
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,720
There must be a good reason
for your action.

160
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
But you hesitate to tell me the truth

161
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
because of my identity.

162
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,560
I understand.

163
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,680
But with every disadvantage comes
an advantage.

164
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,600
If you tell me the truth,

165
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,640
perhaps

166
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
I'll be able to help you.

167
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,680
(If I still don't tell him,)

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
(he probably will
investigate the matter.)

169
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
(I can't risk getting Master Jian involved.)

170
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,960
I came for this.

171
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
I didn't meet with you

172
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,880
at Ci'an Temple that day

173
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,160
because

174
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,680
my mother was murdered

175
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
near Ci'an Temple.

176
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
This fabric

177
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
is a clue to the killer's identity.

178
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,280
You're saying your mother was murdered

179
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,760
on the day we were supposed to meet up.

180
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
I didn't see you that day

181
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,080
and figured you had a change of plan
at the last minute.

182
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,560
So I left.

183
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,880
I never expected this to happen.

184
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,520
It's all my fault.

185
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,400
If I had waited longer

186
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,360
or done a thorough search

187
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,680
around there,

188
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,960
things would have
turned out differently.

189
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,600
Don't blame yourself.

190
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,280
This has nothing to do with you.

191
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
I saw

192
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,240
Young Madam Ou

193
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,240
wearing an outfit

194
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
with the pattern

195
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
on this fabric

196
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,120
the other day.

197
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,080
So

198
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,600
I came here in search of clues.

199
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
You mean

200
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,480
the killer could be a member
of the Ou family.

201
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,760
I don't mean

202
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
to defend the Ou family.

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
But this uncommon embroidery pattern

204
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
isn't exclusively owned
by the Ou family.

205
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,960
It was originated in Japan

206
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,720
and circulated widely among the pirates.

207
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,280
Many things with this embroidery pattern
have made their way into the capital.

208
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,240
I think the Xu family deals

209
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,920
with this embroidery pattern most often

210
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,680
because they have fought
the pirates for a long time.

211
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,240
(The Xu family?)

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,320
(He is a member of the Ou family, after all.)

213
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,080
(I can't believe everything he said.)

214
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Thank you

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,440
for informing me.

216
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,640
Please keep what happened today

217
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,520
between us.

218
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,760
We're involved

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,240
in the death

220
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,440
of Lady Luo's mother.

221
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,480
Now she suspects the Ou family.

222
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,880
We can't sit by.

223
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,080
I need you

224
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,000
to investigate

225
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
and see if other members of
the Ou family

226
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
visited Ci'an Temple that day.

227
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,040
Yes.

228
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
Lady Luo dared to venture

229
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
into the Mansion of Ou alone.

230
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,960
She is out of the ordinary.

231
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,920
Lady Luo is intelligent, courageous

232
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,280
and kind-hearted.

233
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
She is not an ordinary woman.

234
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
Yanxing.

235
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,080
When did you come back?

236
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Lixing.

237
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,040
I came back today.

238
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
We are brothers.

239
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
Don't be formal around me.

240
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,160
You've become thinner.

241
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
You must have suffered

242
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
outside home in the past year.

243
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,160
If Concubine Lin were still alive,

244
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,960
she would worry about you.

245
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,760
If she were still alive,

246
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,200
I would spend every day with her

247
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,760
and our father to perform
my filial duties.

248
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm sure

249
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
you wouldn't want that.

250
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,560
You jest.

251
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,960
Why would I not rejoice

252
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,120
in the reunion?

253
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,480
Good to see you back.

254
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,120
You can help me
handle the household affairs.

255
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,160
Father has almost forgotten

256
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
you are also his son.

257
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
Father wants to see you.

258
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,520
Go now.

259
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,400
Shiyi.

260
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Have you found any clues?

261
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,040
Have you made any discoveries?

262
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,440
Young Madam Ou said

263
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,320
she was the only person in the Ou family

264
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,720
who owned this embroidery pattern

265
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,280
and she didn't know anything else.

266
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
We were in a very
dangerous situation earlier today.

267
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,520
Young Madam Ou

268
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
almost suspected me.

269
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
We must never do that again.

270
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,360
If the Ou family catches us,

271
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,160
we'll be in danger.

272
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,240
Actually,

273
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
I almost got caught earlier.

274
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,680
Mr. Lin Shixian

275
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,880
saved me in time.

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,040
Mr. Lin?

277
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,040
Why was he in the Mansion of Ou?

278
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Lin Shixian is his alias.

279
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,400
He is actually
the second son of Ou family.

280
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,480
Ou Yanxing.

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,120
I've known Mr. Lin for a long time.

282
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,840
But I didn't know
he was a member of the Ou family.

283
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,960
But

284
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,760
now that he saw you,

285
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
didn't he suspect you?

286
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
He did suspect me.

287
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,280
But

288
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,000
he has saved me multiple times

289
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,960
since we first met.

290
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,520
I trust him.

291
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,400
So

292
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,240
I told him

293
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,280
about my mother's death.

294
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,200
Since he helped me today,

295
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm sure he won't expose me.

296
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,000
Father.

297
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,000
You were away from home for over a year.

298
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
Now you're back,

299
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,520
you don't even want to see me?

300
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
That's not true.

301
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,200
I came to you the other day,

302
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,880
but I noticed you were in a bad mood.

303
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
So I left.

304
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,120
I know.

305
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,020
I know

306
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,560
you still hate me.

307
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,640
But your mother

308
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,640
passed away long ago.

309
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
It's time to forget the past.

310
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,520
Forget?

311
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,800
Shortly after you promised

312
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,040
to marry my mother as your legal wife,

313
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,800
you married another woman

314
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,960
to become the head

315
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,200
of this household

316
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,680
and made my mother your concubine.

317
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
You made her die of depression.

318
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,400
Now you expect me

319
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
to forget that

320
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,120
and let all that pass.

321
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,520
I had no choice.

322
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,320
I was forced to do that.

323
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,760
Forced?

324
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,200
Did anyone force you
to marry another woman?

325
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,760
I failed your mother.

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,880
But I've given you and your mother

327
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,200
special treatment all these years.

328
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
My conscience is clear

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,480
and I...

330
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,920
I didn't treat you poorly.

331
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,200
You made my mother die of depression.

332
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,440
You can never make up

333
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
for her suffering.

334
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,680
I've done everything

335
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,680
for the Ou family.

336
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,240
Keep in mind

337
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,080
that you're a member of the Ou family.

338
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,600
You'll come back to the family
sooner or later.

339
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,080
You're so certain

340
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,440
that I can't give up this identity?

341
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,040
The Ou family is yours,

342
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,480
not mine and my mother's.

343
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,280
Fengping Grains

344
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
recently sold some rice
at low prices.

345
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,480
I heard you talked them

346
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,880
into doing this.

347
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,160
You should give more thought

348
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,070
to whether you belong to the Ou family.

349
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,200
Young Madam,

350
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
I don't have the heart to leave you.

351
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,480
Get up.

352
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,360
You've served me for so many years.

353
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,600
I don't have the heart
to let you leave, either.

354
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
But

355
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,560
if I don't marry you off,

356
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,680
Wang Yu

357
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,080
won't let you off.

358
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
Stop crying.

359
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,520
Today is a good day for you.

360
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,600
Crying bodes ill.

361
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,800
Here is your indenture.

362
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,640
Keep it well.

363
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,920
I give you fifty tael of silver

364
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,720
as your dowry.

365
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,040
Save it for future use.

366
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,440
Don't let your husband
know about the money.

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,080
Remember

368
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,560
that men are not necessarily reliable.

369
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,840
It's good to keep

370
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,480
some money for yourself.

371
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
Young Madam, you have made

372
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,320
such a thoughtful plan for me.

373
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,000
But what about you?

374
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,560
If Young Master finds out

375
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,520
you have sent me away,

376
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,880
he won't let you off.

377
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
Don't worry.

378
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll tell him

379
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,240
that you caught a disease

380
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,000
and retreated to a farm
for recuperation.

381
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,800
He is heartless in nature.

382
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,760
He'll gradually move on.

383
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,440
Alright.

384
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,640
It's getting late.

385
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
Leave before

386
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,280
he returns.

387
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,960
Go now.

388
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,840
You have shown great kindness

389
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,280
to me.

390
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I'll repay you in my next life.

391
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,120
Take care, Young Madam.

392
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,920
Baizhi.

393
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,320
Take care.

394
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,440
Jinlian.

395
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,240
I'll leave Young Madam in your hands.

396
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,280
Don't worry, Baizhi.

397
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,120
I'll take good care

398
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,280
of Young Madam.

399
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,280
Alright. Go now.

400
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,320
Go.

401
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,160
Go.

402
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,080
Go. Go.

403
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,560
Go.

404
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,080
Baizhi.

405
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,880
Let me carry it.

406
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Come on.

407
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,760
Your Ladyship.

408
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,760
(Ci'an Temple)
We've paid this place multiple visits

409
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
in a period of over one year.

410
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,400
But we've found nothing.

411
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm afraid that monk

412
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,600
is not here anymore.

413
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,800
Now that I know the Ou family

414
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,000
owns the embroidery pattern,

415
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,080
I have to come here for verification.

416
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,680
I want to know
if the members of the Xu family

417
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,040
were the only ones present that day.

418
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
Let me do it.

419
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,040
Thank you.

420
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
Qingming.

421
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:47,060
(Stateliness)

422
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,360
Enjoy.

423
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,560
Thank you.

424
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,480
Let me do it.

425
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
Qingming,

426
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
where have you been
in the past year and more?

427
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,520
After we met

428
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,760
a year ago,

429
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,160
you disappeared.

430
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,440
My master and I

431
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,680
are nomadic monks

432
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,920
who stayed here temporarily.

433
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,200
After I met you that day,

434
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,480
I followed my master

435
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,120
on his trip all around.

436
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,040
We came back this year

437
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,720
at the invitation of the abbot

438
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,320
of Ci'an Temple.

439
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,920
I see.

440
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,720
Thank you for informing me

441
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,160
that day.

442
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,080
Monks don't lie.

443
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,640
I simply told you the truth.

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,280
To be honest,

445
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,720
I came here

446
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,720
for my mother's death.

447
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,000
I happen to have

448
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,560
something to tell you

449
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,360
about this matter.

450
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
You asked me questions

451
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,920
(Stateliness)
and I answered them that day.

452
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,800
But I forgot

453
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,840
to tell you one thing.

454
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,880
You may tell me now.

455
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,200
I not only saw a woman

456
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,840
before your mother

457
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,280
suffered the tragedy,

458
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,920
but also heard

459
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,040
the muffled sound of a man

460
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,200
talking to that woman.

461
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,520
I couldn't hear him clearly.

462
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,280
But I could tell

463
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,920
they knew each other well.

464
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
A man?

465
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,840
Do you know who he is?

466
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,840
I only heard his voice.
I didn't see him.

467
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,920
Please think back

468
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
carefully.

469
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,000
Did you really not receive anyone

470
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,000
except the members

471
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
of the Xu family?

472
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,040
As far as I know,

473
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,440
we didn't receive anyone else.

474
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,480
If you still have doubts,

475
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,640
feel free to ask

476
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,880
other people in the temple.

477
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,440
Thank you for being honest.

478
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,760
Dongqing.

479
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,200
This fruit is sweet.

480
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,480
Have a try.

481
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,680
It's so sweet and delicious.

482
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,520
This matter has become

483
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,000
even more complicated and confusing.

484
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,920
A man suddenly

485
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,360
entered the picture.

486
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,280
Who is that man?

487
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,640
What's his relationship with that woman?

488
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,720
Why did the killer

489
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,320
murder my mother?

490
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,440
Did my mother see anything

491
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,960
she was not supposed to see?

492
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,020
(Mansion of Xu)

493
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,720
Shiyi.

494
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,840
Lingkuan, you're back.

495
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,080
By the way, Shiyi,

496
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
after you asked me

497
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,840
about the incident in Ci'an Temple,

498
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,880
I asked the servants.

499
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Someone in the temple

500
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,120
saw Concubine Qiao leave for an hour.

501
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,600
Maybe she saw something.

502
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,880
You can

503
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,320
ask her.

504
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,000
Concubine Qiao.

505
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,240
(Did Concubine Qiao)

506
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,560
(be the woman)

507
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,840
(Qingming saw?)

508
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,760
My Lord, you're here.

509
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,360
What's on your mind?

510
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,120
Is something weighing you down?

511
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,720
No.

512
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
My mother's death anniversary
is around the corner.

513
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,960
So I recalled some past events.

514
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,200
Speaking of which,

515
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,720
I never talked to your mother.

516
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,400
But she must be a remarkable woman

517
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,200
because she raised

518
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,320
a daughter like you.

519
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,280
My mother came from

520
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,600
a family of scholars.

521
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,200
Because her family went downhill,

522
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,920
she had to become a concubine.

523
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,920
She might be ordinary,

524
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,920
but she was strong.

525
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,880
We lived in destitution

526
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,600
back in Yuhang.

527
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,400
I embroidered clothes

528
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
and put them up for sale.

529
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,800
But some people haggled
to lower the prices

530
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,000
and take advantage of us.

531
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,760
I figured that earning a little money

532
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,680
was better than earning nothing.

533
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,880
But my mother wept and held her ground,

534
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,440
refusing to sell my works
at lower prices.

535
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,600
She said

536
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
I pulled all-nighters

537
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
to make those embroidery works

538
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,120
and she'd feel bad for me

539
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,040
if she sold them at lower prices.

540
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,000
Come here.

541
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,960
Since your mother's death anniversary

542
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,040
is around the corner,

543
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,920
we should commemorate her

544
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
in the tradition

545
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,480
of the Yuhang people.

546
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,160
Thank you.

547
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,920
My Lord,

548
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,920
can I hold a memorial service

549
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,200
for my mother at home?

550
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,880
Do as you please.

551
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,040
Thank you.

552
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
About my mother...

553
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,920
I not only saw a woman

554
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,160
before your mother

555
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,040
suffered the tragedy,

556
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,640
but also heard

557
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,120
the muffled sound of a man

558
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
talking to that woman.

559
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,800
What's the matter?

560
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,400
Nothing.

561
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,960
What are you looking at?

562
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,160
Dongqing.

563
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,000
(Memorial Service)
Don't fiddle with these things.

564
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,680
Her Ladyship prepared these things.

565
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,760
This is terrifying.

566
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,480
Her Ladyship is not holding

567
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,240
a normal memorial service.

568
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,800
How is it not normal?

569
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,120
Her Ladyship

570
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
has been hung up on

571
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,000
her birth mother Concubine Lv's
accidental death.

572
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,480
(Birth mother Lv's tablet)
She even brought back the spirit tablet.

573
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,440
Dongqing.

574
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
Don't say that.

575
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,280
It could draw that kind of stuff here.

576
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,000
I wouldn't lie to you.

577
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,960
There were two brothers in Shaoxing

578
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,720
who killed someone out of jealousy.

579
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,600
The victim's family

580
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,480
held a memorial service like this.

581
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,040
Then those brothers

582
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,960
acted as if they were possessed.

583
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,600
Guess what happened.

584
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
What happened?

585
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,160
On the first day,

586
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,080
those brothers started to lose hair.

587
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,400
They soon had bruises
all over their bodies.

588
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,160
Three days later,
they felt unbearably itchy

589
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,640
and ulcers covered their bodies.

590
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,880
Their bodies ulcerated.

591
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,800
And on the seventh day,

592
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,520
they died from rotting internal organs.

593
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,080
Isn't it scary?

594
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Dongqing.

595
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,600
-Your Ladyship.
-Your Ladyship.

596
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,240
You should be back working,

597
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,800
not babbling nonsense here.

598
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,280
Your Ladyship, I heard it from others.

599
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,520
I won't babble again.

600
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,160
When a person's conscience is clear,

601
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,840
he or she doesn't frighten easily.

602
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,320
I am not superstitious.

603
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,440
Even if the memorial service

604
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
draws supernatural creatures here,

605
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,080
they'll only revenge themselves
on those who hurt them.

606
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,080
Lianfang, am I right?

607
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,600
Your Ladyship, you're absolutely right.

608
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,000
Ghosts are nonexistent.

609
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,440
They are tricks

610
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,560
played by magicians

611
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,800
to deceive people.

612
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,200
As long as we stay decent,

613
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,720
we don't have to fear them.

(Birth mother Lv's tablet)

617
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,880
Your Ladyship,

618
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,240
I feel under the weather.

619
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,000
I'll excuse myself.

620
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,680
Feel free to leave.

621
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,280
You are dismissed.

622
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
If His Lordship

623
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
hears you gossip behind his back,

624
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,160
he'll be displeased.

625
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,080
Let me do it.

626
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,760
What's wrong, Madam?

627
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,240
I...

628
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,840
I'm losing hair, Xiuyuan.

629
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,320
It's alright, Madam.

630
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,920
I...

631
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,760
I don't usually lose that much hair.

632
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,000
Madam, you're overthinking this.

633
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,800
You probably combed it too hard.

634
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,400
You always lose that much hair.

635
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't always

636
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,240
lose that much hair.

637
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,320

00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,240

(They soon had bruises
all over their bodies.)

643
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,800
So itchy.

644
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,320
So itchy.

645
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,960
I feel itchy all over, Xiuyuan.

646

-So itchy.
-Madam.

647
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
What happened to you?

648
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,120
I feel itchy.

649
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,040
So itchy.

650
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,880
Madam, you...

651
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,800
Hurry up and prepare a carriage.

652
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,640
Prepare a carriage.
We're going to Ci'an Temple.

653
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes.

654
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,160

Can you help me overcome this fate?

664

I'm afraid

665
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,040
this fate is the result

666
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,720
of your own wrongdoing.

667

overcome this fate.

671

I'll pay as much as you wish.

Yes. Rest easy, Madam.

Concubine Qiao feels guilty
as you expected.

690
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,400
What has she done?

691
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,880
I heard from the maids

692
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,630
that Concubine Qiao

693
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,920
believed her loss of hair

694
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,440
was caused by a revengeful ghost.

695
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,150
She even scared herself

696
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,320
into feeling itchy.

697
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,560
Later on,

698
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,710
she went to Ci'an Temple

699
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,080
and prayed for fortune.

700
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,800
Did the fortune teller

701
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,800
inform Concubine Qiao

702
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,190
as I ordered?

703
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Don't worry.

704
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,880
He informed her

705
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,280
as you ordered.

706
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,080
Surprisingly,

707
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,190
Concubine Qiao

708
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,670
didn't do anything

709
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,710
related to Concubine Lv

710
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,520
after the fortune teller informed her.

711
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,630
Instead, she ordered Xiuyuan
to go to Chunxi Garden

712
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,630
and take the jewelry
of late Her Ladyship.

713
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,920
Yuanniang?

714
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,440
Your Ladyship.

715
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,120
Did we go after the wrong person?

716
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,160
Maybe Concubine Qiao is unrelated

717
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,840
to your mother's death.

718
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,280
We went after the wrong person.

719
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
But this doesn't mean

720
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,600
we made an effort in vain.

721
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,960
Concubine Qiao believed

722
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,160
the fortune teller.

723
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,600
She fetched Yuanniang's objects

724
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,920
and recited Buddhist texts.

725
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,960
I'm afraid Yuanniang's death

726
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,840
is related to her.

727
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,080
Marquis Yongping's Mansion
seems peaceful.

728
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,720
But it's actually a dangerous place.

729
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,240
My illness feels suspicious.

730
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,320
No medicine can heal me.

731
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,600
Before Yuanniang died,

732
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,520
she told me her illness felt suspicious.

733
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
Nanny Tao said

734
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,880
she believed Yuanniang

735
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,560
was murdered by someone.

736
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Did Concubine Qiao

737
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,800
really murder her?

738
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,720
It's a no-brainer.

739
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,680
She must have done that.

740
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,280
We should tell His Lordship right now.

741
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,920
Even if we are right,

742
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,120
this is a serious matter

743
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
and Great Madam

744
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,600
favors Concubine Qiao.

745
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,400
If we accuse her

746
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,400
without concrete evidence,

747
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,800
we'll only achieve undesirable results.

748
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
We need to give this matter
some further thought.

749
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,680
Your Ladyship.

750
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,560
You wanted to see me?

751
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,080
Nanny Tao.

752
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,440
I heard that He's Clinic

753
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,920
offered an effective medication

754
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
the other day.

755
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,440
It reminded me of the fact

756
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,320
that Yuanniang

757
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,720
had been taking

758
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,720
the medication of He's Clinic.

759
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,480
But why was she still

760
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,040
bed-ridden all the time?

761
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,400
Your Ladyship, you should know

762
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
she had a cold womb.

763
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,960
After she married into the Xu family,

764
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,680
she had trouble conceiving.

765
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,880
Then she took the medication

766
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,440
of He's Clinic

767
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,120
and conceived Zhun.

768
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,080
But

769
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,640
Zhun's premature birth

770
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,480
left her with illness.

771
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,280
Fortunately, the medication

772
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,320
helped her conceive

773
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,000
her second child.

774
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,440
But she had a miscarriage.

775
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,400
After that, she became frail

776
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,040
and no medicine could heal her.

777
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,840
Are you saying

778
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,360
Yuanniang's illness was originated
in the miscarriage?

779
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,200
Yes.

780
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,840
Was there anything wrong
with the miscarriage?

781
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,880
She suspected that someone played dirty

782
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,640
to cause the miscarriage.

783
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,520
But her investigation

784
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,800
led nowhere.

785
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,000
Then she died with regrets.

786
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,080
About Yuanniang's medication...

787
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,080
Physician He of He's Clinic

788
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,840
prescribed the medication

789
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,160
himself.

790
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,240
She trusted Physician He

791
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,600
very much.

792
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,480
And I oversaw the whole process,

793
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,520
including the acquisition
and boiling of the medication.

794
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,160
I always tried the medication

795
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,520
before she took it.

796
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,640
The medication was not poisonous.

797
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,280
Besides, it took effect

798
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,960
after she took it.

799
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,360
I think

800
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,200
there was nothing wrong with
the medication.

801
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,240
She was ill-fated.

802
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,600
If she weren't frail,

803
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Qiao Lianfang wouldn't

804
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,160
have had the chance

805
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,840
to seduce His Lordship.

806
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,040
Concubine Qiao often came

807
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,400
to the Mansion of Xu
before Yuanniang fell ill?

808
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,880
Yes.

809
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,320
Qiao Lianfang is the niece

810
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,320
of Great Madam.

811
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,040
So she often visited the Mansion of Xu.

812
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,000
Qiao Lianfang took pains

813
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,960
to fawn on Great Madam

814
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,200
and His Lordship.

815
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,360
Your Ladyship,

816
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
if you hadn't married His Lordship,

817
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,720
Qiao Lianfang

818
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,080
would have become

819
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
the wife of Marquis Yongping.

820
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,480
Your Ladyship

821
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,360
what made you

822
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,200
ask about this?

823
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,800
I heard people talk

824
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,120
about the medication.

825
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
It reminded me of Yuanniang.

826
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,600
Oh,

827
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
there is one more thing.

828
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
From now on,

829
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,720
I expect you to relay

830
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,920
the Luo family's messages to me,

831
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,520
instead of making plans

832
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,800
with my maids in secret.

833
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,320
If His Lordship knows what you did,

834
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,280
he might punish you

835
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,680
for harboring ill intentions,

836
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,080
which is bad for you.

837
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
I'd never do that, Your Ladyship.

838
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,880
I swear I'd never do that.

839
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,240
You must be mistaken.

840
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,400
Even if you told me to do that,

841
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
I wouldn't do that.

842
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm just reminding you

843
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,280
that trouble arises from action.

844
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,600
Zhun will suffer

845
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,280
if we give way to internal conflict.

846
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,380
After all,

847
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,800
no individual can stay unharmed
if the whole group is in distress.

848
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,120
Am I right?

849
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,720
Yes, Your Ladyship.

850
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,280
You may leave.

851
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,600
Yes.

852
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,200
How did it go, Your Ladyship?

853
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,000
The interested party is suspicious.

854
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,560
Concubine Qiao is very likely

855
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,680
to have murdered Yuanniang.

856
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,560
Your Ladyship,

857
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,000
you were framed

858
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,360
at Xishan Villa.

859
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,840
Concubine Qiao gave a puppy to Zhun

860
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,400
to make him ill repeatedly.

861
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,360
Although

862
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,960
we have no concrete evidence,

863
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,120
but they must be related to
Concubine Qiao.

864
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,160
If she also

865
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,640
murdered late Her Ladyship,

866
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,920
then you and Zhun

867
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,600
are in a very dangerous situation.

868
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,880
For the sake of Zhun

869
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,400
and myself,

870
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,560
I must find evidence to prove

871
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,000
Concubine Qiao murdered Yuanniang.

872
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,520
I must

873
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,040
make her pay

874
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,560
for her crime.

875
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,540
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

876
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,640
You haven't gone to bed.

877
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,840
My Lord.

878
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,440
What's the matter?

879
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,260
(Birth mother Lv's tablet)

880
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,280
Due to the memorial service,

881
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,480
I need to keep

882
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,520
my mother's spirit tablet

883
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,080
for 49 days.

884
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,480
I'll send it back to the Luo family

885
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,480
after the memorial service is over.

886
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,560
Yeah.

887
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,400
Your mother's spirit tablet

888
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,200
can't be placed in
the Luo family's ancestral shrine.

889
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,480
How about this?

890
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,920
You can keep

891
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,600
your mother's spirit tablet

892
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,320
here forever if you want.

893
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,760
Can I?

894
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,720
You are my wife.

895
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,960
Of course you can.

896
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,480
By the way,

897
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,480
I've made soup.

898
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,120
I'll tell Dongqing to bring it in.

899
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:32,920
Sure.

Zhun, slow down.

Zhun.

905
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,920
Mother, I'm scared.

906
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,360
Be careful. Be careful.

907
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,280
Be careful not to fall, Zhun.

908
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,360
Slow down, Zhun.

909
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,000
You shouldn't have come out
at this late hour.

910
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,440
Mother.

911
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,800
Slow down, Zhun.

912
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,360
Mother.

913
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,560
Mother. Mother.

Mother.

915

Your Lordship, Your Ladyship,

916
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,320
I'm really sorry

917
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,280
for bothering you

918
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,920
at this late hour.

919
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,120
Zhun

920
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
heard a superstitious rumor

921
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,920
from some senseless servants

922
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,840
the other day.

923
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,160
It scared him.

924
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,200
He couldn't sleep well tonight.

925
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,040
He kept calling for his mother.

926
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,080
It's fine. You may leave.

927
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:32,880
Yes.

928
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,640
-Zhun, what happened?
-Good boy, don't cry.

929
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,440
Why are you crying?

930
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,480
I dreamed of you abandoning me.

931

I was left alone outside,

932
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,440
cold and hungry.

933
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,680
Nobody paid me attention.

934
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,040
Why would we

935
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,440
abandon you?

936
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,040
