All the time

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,040
I loathed the family disputes

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,960
and felt reluctant to face them.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,000
I believed I'd lose freedom
if I married into this family.

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
But since I married you,

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,120
you've been sticking up for me

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,960
and we've faced
a lot of things together.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
I feel that I fear nothing

for this Divorce Agreement.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
Keep it.

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,560
It can remind me

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,240
that I should cherish what I have.

can rest in peace.

I'll be with you forever.

40
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,200
Open the door.

41
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,640
Yes.

42
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,640
You're here.

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,200
I came to ask

44
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,000
why you used me to hurt Her Ladyship.

45
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,800
Believe it or not,

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,240
I never wanted

47
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,400
to hurt Her Ladyship.

48
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I only wanted her

49
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,840
to leave the Xu family

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
and live as she wishes.

51
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Did you think of me?

52
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,640
What if Great Madam

53
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,800
sold me?

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,680
No.

55
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,340
Her Ladyship would never let Great Madam

56
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
sell you.

57
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,880
There were only
two possible futures for you.

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,480
One was Her Ladyship taking you away

59
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,760
and the other was you choosing

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,400
to stay in this mansion
as His Lordship's concubine.

61
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
You're infatuated with His Lordship.

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,320
I did it

63
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
to grant your wish.

64
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,800
I was killing two birds with one stone.

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm not infatuated with His Lordship.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,080
I took His Lordship's belt

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,960
to learn Her Ladyship's stitches

68
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,480
and make an exact copy of the belt

69
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
for General Fu.

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,680
General Fu?

71
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,240
Yes.

72
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,920
The man I adore

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
has always been General Fu,

74
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
not His Lordship.

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
You used me

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,920
to collude with the Ou family

77
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,520
and almost got Her Ladyship killed.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,040
I didn't collude with the Ou family.

79
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
And I'd never hurt Her Ladyship.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
I just couldn't bear
watching Her Ladyship

81
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,400
make compromises in the Xu family.

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,480
Xu Lingyi played with a woman
and dumped her.

83
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
He is not a good man.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,520
A man like him

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,920
doesn't deserve Her Ladyship.

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
Her Ladyship will have a better life

87
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,600
if she leaves the Xu family.

88
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,480
When did I play with a woman
and dump her?

89
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,680
Amber,

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,120
what made you

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
accuse His Lordship?

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,880
I know you don't want to hurt me.

93
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,000
But I'm worried that
someone is using you.

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,280
What exactly happened?

95
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,920
Your Ladyship,

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,320
you should ask him.

97
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,320
I'd call myself aboveboard.

98
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
I've never

99
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,080
betrayed anyone.

100
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
Aboveboard?

101
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,960
Did my elder sister

102
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,200
not die?

103
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
You've found your sister?

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,040
Your Ladyship,

105
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,440
my sister was Concubine Tong.

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
I never expected her

107
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
to die

108
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,000
before I could

109
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,320
reunite with her.

110
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,320
My sister hanged herself

111
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
after being wronged.

112
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,880
And you caused

113
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,000
all that.

114
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,720
You and Yuanniang

115
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,480
got my sister killed.

116
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,160
Madam.

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
His Lordship came back

118
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,840
with Her Ladyship yesterday.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,440
Her Ladyship released Dongqing

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
and locked Amber up
in the firewood room.

121
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
I don't know what happened.

122
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,000
I see.

123
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,360
You may go.

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes.

125
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
The Luo family is sinister,

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,720
Yuanniang was despicable,

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,550
and you were heartless.

128
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
All of you

129
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,040
forced my sister to kill herself.

130
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,640
You didn't love my sister.

131
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
But if you already took her
as your concubine,

132
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,360
why did you ignore her

133
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,520
and let others humiliate
and trample her?

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
You're a heartless man

135
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,040
who played with a woman and dumped her.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
How can you make Her Ladyship happy?

137
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,040
So you incited Dongqing,

138
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
forced me to make a choice,

139
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
and sowed discord
between me and His Lordship.

140
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
Your Ladyship,

141
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,160
aren't the recent incidents

142
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,920
enough to make you come around?

143
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,160
The Xu family pushed you again and again

144
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,160
for their own interests.

145
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,080
This kind of place

146
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,640
is not worth staying.

147
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,440
Amber,

148
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
I was drunk on the night

149
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,440
when your sister came to me,

150
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,800
but my mind was clear.

151
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,480
We didn't

152
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,840
cross the line.

153
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,480
No way.

154
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,240
If you didn't touch my sister,

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,680
why did you take her as your concubine?

156
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
On the next morning when I woke up,

157
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,560
I learned that Yuanniang
had informed Mother

158
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,520
and asked her

159
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,000
to make Biyu my concubine.

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
I guessed

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,120
Yuanniang and Concubine Tong

162
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,560
conspired together.

163
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,440
I didn't want that.

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
But if I refused to take Biyu

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,160
as my concubine,

166
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,000
Biyu would lose her place

167
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,200
in the Xu family.

168
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,600
But my sister

169
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,480
didn't conspire with late Her Ladyship.

170
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,080
She was forced to do that.

171
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,920
I asked Biyu

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,160
if she had difficulties.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,520
But she said nothing.

174
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
My sister did it

175
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,240
because of me.

176
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
Amber, I'm sorry.

177
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
If I'd known

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,520
your sister's story sooner,

179
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,040
this wouldn't have happened.

180
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,080
Your Ladyship,

181
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,760
even if His Lordship
had no hand in her death,

182
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,400
will you really be happy

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
in the Xu family?

184
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,360
Amber,

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,480
I know you care about me.

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,840
But love is a personal matter

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
and only the person in love
knows how it feels.

188
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
You see

189
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,560
Mother push me

190
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,880
and think I'm unfortunate.

191
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,640
But I see

192
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,120
a man who's been

193
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,760
staunchly supporting me

194
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,600
and going out of his way

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,320
to solve my problems

196
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,280
regardless of his own gains and losses

197
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
when I'm in trouble,

198
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,680
tired and frustrated.

199
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,480
It makes me happy

200
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
the most.

201
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,800
I'm happy now.

202
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
I see.

203
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,000
I was wrong.

204
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,680
My Lord.

205
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,440
Amber is like my own sister.

206
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,440
If I'd cared more about her,

207
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,320
she wouldn't have been used

208
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,240
and this wouldn't have happened.

209
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,240
I'm responsible for this.

210
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,680
I failed to discipline my maid.

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
Will you please not tell Great Madam

212
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,880
what Amber did?

213
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
For the sake of Shiyi

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,280
and Concubine Tong,

215
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,160
I won't punish you,

216
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,040
but I can't tolerate

217
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,240
your betrayal.

218
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,840
If we hadn't found out
the truth in time,

219
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,280
we probably would have

220
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,360
died at the hands of the Ou family.

221
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
You need to leave the Xu family.

222
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,880
She got you in danger.

223
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,960
My decision is final.

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,400
Your Ladyship,

225
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,120
I failed you.

226
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,320
I know I've committed serious crimes.

227
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,240
I dare not wish for your forgiveness.

228
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,160
I just hope

229
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,840
you'll take care

230
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,280
when I'm not with you.

231
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,520
You should take care too.

232
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,200
If you have no place to go,

233
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,400
turn to Xianling Pavilion.

234
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,520
Master Jian will take you in.

235
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,640
Thank you.

236
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,560
I'll take good care of myself.

237
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,240
By the way,

238
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,840
tell me

239
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,480
how you found out

240
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,120
Concubine Tong was your sister.

241
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,200
I discovered my sister's
embroidered handkerchief

242
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,760
at Concubine Qin's place.

243
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:30,020
(Virtues Above All
Ancestors Memorial Tablets)

244
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Father.

245
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,080
Ling'an.

246
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,080
Ou Lixing,

247
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,680
who helped Marquis Jingyuan frame you,

248
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,080
has been brought to justice.

249
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,960
You can

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,640
rest in peace.

251
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,920
I'll find evidence

252
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,440
to prove Marquis Jingyuan guilty
as soon as possible.

253
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,760
I'll ensure the destructive Ou family

254
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,840
get the punishment they deserve.

255
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,760
Young Madam.

256
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,640
Dear.

257
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,320
Dear.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How could this happen?

259
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,920
How could this happen?

260
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,640
Marquis

261
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,000
How did he die?

262
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,560
Marquis

263
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,400
Vice Minister Ou died from
a cut in the throat.

264
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,720
Several people in black

265
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,800
lay dead at the scene.

266
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,920
I think

267
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,240
he met bandits.

268
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
There...There has been
an oversight.

269
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,360
Let me go back for another inspection.

270
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,640
I'll find the killer

271
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
of your son.

272
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,800
My Lord.

273
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,320
My Lord.

274
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,720
My subordinate just reported.

275
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,440
My Lord.

276
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
There's something fishy about this.

277
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,640
Master Yanxing

278
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,080
told the carriage drivers
to take him out of the city

279
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,360
in a carriage the other day.

280
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,600
Soon, Master Lixing

281
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,920
brought people out of the city.

282
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
Someone saw

283
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
Marquis Yongping and Duke Wei

284
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,480
return from outside the city

285
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
shortly after.

286
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
The Magistrate has good judgment.

287
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,120
Master Lixing was indeed killed

288
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,320
by bandits.

289
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,120
Please go and close the case.

290
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,600
Why should he close the case?

291
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,760
Why should he close the case?

292
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,240
Why not carry out an investigation?

293
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,240
That bastard did this.

294
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,680
The bastard Xu Lingyi did this.

295
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
Forgive me, Young Madam.

296
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,120
He took the assassins

297
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,360
of the first order with him.

298
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,080
We can't let anyone know.

299
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,160
Keeping private troops
indicates rebellion,

300
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,840
which is a felony punishable by death.

301
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,520
Besides,

302
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,560
he didn't inform His Lordship

303
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,960
before taking people out of the city.

304
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What was he up to?

305
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,560
Dear.

306
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,440
Xu Lingyi.

307
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,520
I vow to destroy you!

308
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,440
Our plan

309
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
was progressing smoothly.

310
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,960
How come you suddenly died?

311
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,400
How did you die?

312
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,400
Ou Yanxing

313
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
came back alive.

314
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,120
Did he collude with Xu Lingyi

315
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,560
to kill you?

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,560
You told me

317
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
you did everything

318
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,760
for the Ou family.

319
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,200
You were so loyal to the Ou family,

320
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,440
yet they got you killed.

321
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,560
Look at him!

322
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,320
Ou Yanxing

323
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,160
gained everything effortlessly.

324
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
Why?

325
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,200
This is unfair for you.

326
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,800
It's unfair.

327
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,800
Dongqing.

328
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,680
Dongqing.

329
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Don't you know you can't enter

330
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,920
the backyard of this mansion?

331
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,720
Get out.

332
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,520
I know everything now.

333
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,000
I misunderstood you.

334
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,200
It was my fault.

335
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,280
I'm sorry.

336
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,120
But you can't

337
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
solely blame it on me.

338
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,560
If you hadn't told me those things,

339
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,920
I wouldn't have misunderstood you.

340
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,320
So it was my fault?

341
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,920
I said worse things to Her Ladyship.

342
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,480
But she's always

343
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
trusted me.

344
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,520
You just didn't trust me

345
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,520
in the first place.

346
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,800
You are right. It was my fault.

347
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,000
I know

349
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,440
you didn't seduce His Lordship.

350
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,320
But I don't understand

351
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,160
why you kept

352
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,440
His Lordship's belt.

353
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
For whom do you think

354
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,680
I kept the belt?

355
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,760
Someone said he likes it,

356
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,400
so I secretly took it to make a copy.

357
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,440
I...

358
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,920
Dongqing,

359
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,520
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,960
I shouldn't have suspected you.

361
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,280
Whether you suspected me

362
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,760
has nothing to do with me.

363
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
Of course it is related to you.

364
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,360
You know I love you.

365
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
I want to marry you.

366
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,280
Why are you speaking so loudly?

367
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,520
People might hear you.

368
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,560
So what if I speak loudly?

369
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm not afraid of letting people know.

370
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,640
I love you and I want to marry you.

371
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,680
Did you hear that?

372
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,240
Stop talking.

373
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,120
Alright.

374
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,320
You call the shots.

375
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,120
If you don't want me to talk about it,

376
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,200
I won't.

377
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,040
But I need to ask you a question.

378
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,000
How do you feel

379
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,840
when you're with me?

380
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,120
I like roughhousing

381
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,760
and joking

382
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,720
with you.

383
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,360
Are you happy?

384
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,920
I'm quite happy.

385
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,000
Besides...

386
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
What?

387
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Besides, I often

388
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,640
thought of you

389
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,160
and wanted to see you

390
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,280
before all this.

391
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,440
Dongqing.

392
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,800
You called me

393
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,760
a greedy villain.

394
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,600
I won't forgive you

395
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,000
so easily.

396
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,960
What do you want with me?

397
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,480
You still have it.

398
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,840
So what?

399
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,200
You broke it.

400
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,280
If you could restore it
to its original condition,

401
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,320
I'll forgive you.

402
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,160
But that's impossible.

403
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,520
You're giving me
a hard time deliberately.

404
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Yes, I am giving you a hard time.

405
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,200
So what?

406
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,120
General Fu.

407
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,320
Zhaoying.

408
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Do you know

409
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,400
any skillful jeweler?

410
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,840
I want to repair this hairpin.

411
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,360
It's broken.

412
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,760
It's hard to repair.

413
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,320
How about you buy a new one?

414
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,240
No.

415
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
Dongqing said...

416
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,920
She said

417
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,800
she'd forgive me only if

418
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,120
I restored this hairpin
to its original condition.

419
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,960
That's tough.

420
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,440
It seems

421
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,520
Dongqing is still mad at you

422
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,520
and she won't cool down

423
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
anytime soon.

424
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,040
I don't need you to point it out.

425
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,920
I want you to help me,

426
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,480
not remind me of my misery.

427
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,160
You still don't understand

428
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,960
Dongqing's intention.

429
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,160
What do you mean?

430
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
She is mad at you.

431
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,720
So she gave you an impossible task

432
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,000
to spite you.

433
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,600
The point is not repairing the hairpin.

434
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,160
It is appeasing her.

435
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Smart-ass.

436
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,720
Mother.

437
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,160
The teacher commends Zhun

438
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,700
Catch this.

439
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,240
for his greater concentration
on schoolwork.

440
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,760
Zhun is such a good kicker.

441
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,840
Zhun.

442
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,080
Kick it here.

443
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,400
My Lord.

444
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,640
News broke from Fujian.

445
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,760
They said we still...

446
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,760
Mother.

447
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,400
I have work to do.

448
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
Go about your business.

449
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Come on. One more kick.

450
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,880
Zhun.

451
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,840
Great Madam.

452
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,920
I suddenly feel a little ill.

453
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,240
Maybe I should go back.

454
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,400
What is ailing you?

455
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,360
Do you need a physician?

456
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,160
No.

457
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,600
I think I didn't sleep well last night.

458
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,440
I'll get better
if I go back for some rest.

459
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,400
Come here.

460
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,640
My Lord.

461
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,240
What did Wang Jiubao write?

462
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,560
He sent good news.

463
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,480
I'm sure there will

464
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
be a result soon.

465
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,160
You must know me.

466
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,000
Marquis Jingyuan.

467
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,800
Sit down.

468
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,120
Why are you here?

469
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,560
Where is Young Madam Ou?

470
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,120
I'll ask questions and you'll answer.

471
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,400
Yes.

472
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,960
Yan Gang.

473
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Come here.

474
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,360
Don't be afraid

475
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,880
or restrained.

476
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,920
I won't make things difficult for you.

477
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,600
Here.

478
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,400
Let's drink a cup of wine
and steady our nerves.

479
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,360
You helped the Ou family

480
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,280
as the concubine of Xu Lingyi,

481
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,480
because Ou Lixing

482
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,240
promised you benefits, right?

483
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,360
He promised

484
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,960
to help me take revenge.

485
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,880
When the Xu family is eliminated

486
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,000
he'd give me enough money,

487
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,800
let me travel far,

488
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,320
help me settle down,

489
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,880
and

490
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,240
give me

491
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,960
an orphan.

492
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,760
That's not hard.

493
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,760
I'll send you to Fujian

494
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,400
and

495
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,760
give you the identity

496
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
of our distant relative.

497
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,520
Thank you, Marquis.

498
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,520
I just have one question.

499
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,160
How did Ou Lixing die?

500
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,480
I really don't know.

501
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,000
Don't be afraid.

502
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,200
I'm not suspecting you.

503
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,200
I think

504
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
he had some plan

505
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,960
that he didn't tell me about.

506
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,960
Maybe

507
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,600
some part of his plan

508
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
went wrong.

509
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,440
Just tell me

510
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,720
what you know.

511
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,600
Alright.

512
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,320
He only told me to damage

513
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,640
the relationship between
Xu Lingyi and his wife.

514
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,000
General Fu.

515
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,440
I know that man.

516
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,800
He is Yan Gang,
a guard of the Ou family.

517
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,120
The Ou family is indeed behind all this.

518
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,400
Should I report to His Lordship?

519
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,080
No.

520
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,400
If Marquis Jingyuan finds out

521
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,160
we know the Ou family

522
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,760
is related to Concubine Qin,

523
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,360
our enemy will be alerted.

524
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,040
Let's wait and see.

525
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,560
Xu Lingyi left the Xu family

526
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,360
to go after Her Ladyship.

527
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,480
I don't know what happened

528
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,120
after that.

529
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,280
Then

530
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,120
I heard Vice Minister Ou died.

531
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,720
Xu Lingyi received a letter

532
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,280
from Fujian earlier today.

533
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,240
I followed him

534
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,760
and eavesdropped on their conversation.

535
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,560
I learned that
Wang Jiubao wrote the letter.

536
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,440
Xu Lingyi read the letter

537
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,520
and said there was good news.

538
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,240
Stupid woman.

539
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,080
You got my son killed.

540
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,440
You deserve to die.

541
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,160
Marquis.

542
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,960
Something bad happened.

543
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,120
Madam.

544
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,320
-Madam.
-Madam.

545
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,840
Madam.

546
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,920
This is poisoned.

547
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,960
Hang on. Let me take you to the clinic.

548
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,840
No.

549
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,240
I'm not going to the clinic.

550
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,440
Take me to His Lordship.

551
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,960
I want to see His Lordship.

552
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,200
Zhaoying.

553
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,600
Get a physician to the Mansion of Xu.

554
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,280
Yes.

555
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,040
Shiliu has served

556
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,520
the Xu family for years.

557
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,280
I thought

558
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,520
she is loyal and well-behaved.

559
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,560
How...

560
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,120
How did she become

561
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,080
the Ou family's informant?

562
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
I know I've neglected her.

563
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,150
But does she hate me so?

564
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,960
She went as far as to conspire with
the Ou family against me.

565
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,600
My Lord.

566
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,520
Madam.

567
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,670
Concubine Qin was poisoned.

568
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,440
I didn't expect the Ou family

569
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,190
to take lethal action
to silence her so soon.

570
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,150
I was careless.

571
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,000
Go. Find a physician.

572
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,960
Help her lie down.

573
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,360
Madam.

574
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,230
So...

575
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
So, you all know.

576
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,630
Don't talk.

577
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,360
Let me help you lie down for some rest.

578
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,400
When did you ever care about me?

579
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,720
Don't bother to feign affection.

580
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,920
I know

581
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll die soon.

582
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,320
I won't rest in peace

583
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,160
unless I get it out of my system.

584
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,440
That's right.

585
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,520
I'm the informant you tried to find.

586
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,440
You pretended to behave well

587
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,160
when you harbored evil intentions

588
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,760
for all these years.

589
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,440
Tell me how many things you've done

590
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,600
to hurt the Xu family.

591
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,960
Tell me.

592
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,200
Let me think.

593
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,640
Too many to count.

594
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,720
Shiliu,

595
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,280
I promoted you

596
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,160
from a maid to the concubine.

597
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,320
I gave you a title and higher status.

598
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,720
I trusted you.

599
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,760
I never skimped on

600
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,440
your necessities

601
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,440
and monthly allowance.

602
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,400
Did I ever treat you unfairly?

603
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,280
Tell me

604
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,440
what could have dissatisfied you.

605
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,840
Why did you

606
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
hurt the Xu family?

607
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,040
Why did I hurt the Xu family?

608
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,000
Don't you know?

609
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,720
Know what?

610
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,520
Because you belittled me

611
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,360
and trampled me.

612
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,840
You feigned affection

613
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,720
and did heinous things.

614
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,600
Don't you...

615
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,280
Don't you slander the Xu family!

616
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,640
You're saying nonsense.

617
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,040
Nonsense?

618
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,400
Then why did you make me

619
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,680
His Lordship's bedroom maid?

620
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,560
Shiliu.

621
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,640
I always thought

622
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,480
you were

623
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,240
sensible, well-behaved,

624
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,120
and docile.

625
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,680
That's why

626
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,680
I made you provide
personal care to Lingyi

627
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,400
after he got injured
and slipped into a coma.

628
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,320
Then I made you his bedroom maid

629
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,000
to protect your reputation.

630
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,680
You did those things for my good?

631
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,080
Then why did you make me
consume the contraception decoction?

632
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,160
Because...

633
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,200
Because...

634
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Because you didn't want
me to have children!

635
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,840
Because His Lordship
hadn't found a legal wife.

636
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,240
You worried that his future wife

637
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,840
would be unhappy
about me having children.

638
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,960
So you made me
consume the contraception decoction.

639
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,880
But the contraception decoction

640
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,560
caused me a miscarriage

641
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,040
and made me unable

642
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,880
to have children any more.

643
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,360
I've been hating you

644
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,080
since I lost my child.

645
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,400
Physician.

646
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,280
I didn't fall or scrape myself.

647
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,240
How did I lose my child?

648
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,240
Have you consumed

649
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,320
any kind of decoction?

650
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,360
She...

651
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,760
She took

652
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,080
the contraception decoction.

653
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,240
Not everyone can stand
that kind of medicine

654
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,400
with strong side effects.

655
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,080
But she hasn't taken it

656
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,360
in a long time.

657
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,360
Concubine Wen
and the others also took it.

658
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,480
Why is she

659
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,400
the only one harmed?

660
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,600
Physician,

661
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,520
there must be a remedy, right?

662
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,400
Every drug has its side effects.

663
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
The contraception decoction

664
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,080
is of frigid nature.

665
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,440
Besides,

666
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,760
you were already weak
before you took the decoction.

667
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
I'm afraid

668
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,800
you'll never able to conceive again.

669
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,920
-Physician.
-Physician.

670
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,120
I don't believe it.

671
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,360
-Physician.
-Madam.

672
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,320
Physician, please help me. Physician.

673
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,520
Madam.

674
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,440
I want my child, physician.

675
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,960
I have neither a child

676
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,880
nor His Lordship's favor.

677
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,120
I spent every day and night

678
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,720
repetitively

679
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,560
in this tiny nook

680
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,320
of Eastern Lateral Court.

681
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840
You wouldn't understand

682
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,160
my loneliness and despair.

683
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,040
And you,

684
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,600
Luo Shiyi,

685
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,480
you made me believe

686
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,520
I could raise Jie.

687
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,160
You made me believe

688
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,760
hope was back in my life.

689
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,480
But it turned out to be false.

690
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,520
I was only a pawn you used

691
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,920
to contend for power.

692
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,960
Shiyi fought to get you the child.

693
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,600
But I had other plans.

694
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,680
Yizhen has been educating
all the children at home.

695
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,440
She is the best choice

696
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,200
for educating Jie.

697
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,960
Second Madam is noble

698
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,800
while I am lowly.

699
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,080
Therefore I don't even

700
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,160
deserve to be a mother.

701
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,880
That's not what I meant.

702
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,520
Kid,

703
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm sorry that you suffered.

704
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,600
I made well-thought-out plans,

705
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,520
but the plans weren't suitable for you.

706
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,880
I brought so much suffering to you.

707
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,920
It's my fault that
the Ou family poisoned you.

708
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,720
Great Madam,

709
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,240
I'm dying.

710
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,880
Don't bother with your caring act.

711
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,480
You were sold to this family as a kid.

712
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,040
You were well-behaved, clever,

713
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,040
sensible and attentive.

714
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,760
I always

715
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,360
like you.

716
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,800
I wouldn't have sent you

717
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,840
to Lingyi's side otherwise.

718
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,120
I didn't want you
to bear the first son of this family,

719
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,920
because I worried

720
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,280
that Lingyi's future legal wife

721
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,040
would give you a hard time.

722
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,960
But I never knew

723
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,040
the contraception decoction

724
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,760
brought you so much hurt

725
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,320
and so many grievances.

726
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,200
I treated you unfairly.

727
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm sorry.

728
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,920
Mother.

729
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,120
I should be the one apologizing.

730
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,800
I've neglected you all this time.

731
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,760
I waited for so many years

733
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,080
until you apologized.

734
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,440
Are you alright?

735
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,400
Shiliu.

736
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,480
I...

737
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,440
This is the result

738
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,240
of my wrongdoing.

739
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,320
I brought doom upon myself.

740
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,800
But

741
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,240
I'm not going to forgive you.

742
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Let's offset our debts

743
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,160
to each other.

744
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,560
Hang on.

745
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,040
A physician will be here soon.

746
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,680
Shiliu,

747
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,280
few women

748
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,480
are born in wealthy families.

749
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,440
Few women are born
to be the legitimate daughter.

750
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,120
Many people have been
facing an unfair fate

751
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,320
since birth.

752
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,360
We don't want to
resign ourselves to fate.

753
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
So we have to fight

754
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,120
for everything we want.

755
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,360
But you employed the wrong methods.

756
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,640
Your Ladyship.

757
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,080
Actually,

758
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,760
I was there

759
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,040
when your mother died.

760
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,800
It seems Luo Yuanniang's
days are numbered.

761
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,280
If anything happens

762
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,760
in the Xu family,

763
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
inform me.

764
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,040
Send me messages

765
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,240
via the vase as usual.

766
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,360
Yes.

767
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,240
You may go.

768
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,120
Yes.

769
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,880
You're doing well.

770
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,200
But my brother

771
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,240
is knee-deep in trouble.

772
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,200
Shouldn't you do something?

773
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,320
Your brother

774
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,560
has been captured

775
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,280
by none other than Xu Lingyi.

776
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,120
I can't help you.

777
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,800
I won't leave

778
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,240
unless you rescue my brother.

779
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,000
By the way,

780
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,080
remember that

781
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,840
over all the past years,

782
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,520
your Ou family has made a lot of money

783
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,160
with our help.

784
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,040
Stop!

785
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,920
Catch her!

786
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,720
Thank you for telling me.

787
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,040
Actually,

788
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,000
I should have told you sooner.

789
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,440
I know

790
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,920
you aren't like them.

791
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,840
You're a good person.

792
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,560
My Lord,

793
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,520
I know

794
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,480
you don't love me.

795
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,440
I also know

796
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,720
you're tolerant.

797
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,960
Too bad

798
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,920
I can't have your love.

799
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,040
If there is a next life,

800
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,320
I hope

801
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,520
I'll be born into an ordinary family

802
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,800
and married

803
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,560
to an ordinary man.

804
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,880
I hope I'll bear a few lovely children.

805
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,560
I will no doubt be

806
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,320
a wonderful mother.
