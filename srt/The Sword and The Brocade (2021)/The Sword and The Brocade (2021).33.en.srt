Concubine Yang,

23
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,750
you stole from the house.

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,560
What will your punishment be?

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,640
Your Ladyship,

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,440
I didn't steal the money.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,440
This came from my savings.

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,240
You can go over the accounts

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,440
to confirm

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,800
if I was telling the truth.

Embezzlement

are not rare

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
in this house.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,280
Going over the accounts?

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
How can that be the solution?

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,400
You will be deemed guilty

38
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
unless you can prove

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,920
your innocence.

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Your Ladyship,

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,480
do whatever you want with me

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
if you insist

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
that I stole this money.

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,440
However,

45
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,640
this money is to

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,680
save my daughter's life.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,400
Your Ladyship,

you are a kind person.

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,920
Please allow me to send the money

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
to Erniang.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,600
Drag her away.

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920

please do not do this to me!

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,240

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
I didn't steal it!

65

Please save Erniang!

66
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,680
She is miserable.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
Stop crying.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
Her Ladyship showed mercy.

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,440
She said

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,560
she'd get someone to send money

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,280
to Erniang.

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Madam,

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,680
you know the rules of the house.

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,960
Stealing from the house

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,840
will be subject to paddling.

76
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,800
Through her generosity,

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,240
Her Ladyship only has you
locked in the woodshed.

78
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,560
You should be grateful for that.

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
Stop making noise anymore.

80
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,440
I didn't steal anything!

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,880
Please, I'm begging you! Open the door!

82
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,400
Open the door!

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,040
Open the door!

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,480
Open the door!

85
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,520
Open the door!

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Open the door!

87
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,720
Hold on.

88
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,400
What's that in your hand?

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
Madam Liu,

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,280
this is for Young Madam

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,560
from the Luo family.

92
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,280
Give it to me.

93
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,000
I will send it to Young Madam.

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,240
Well...

95
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,740
(Precious Breezes and Dew of the Moon)

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,240
Your Ladyship, Concubine Yang fell ill.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,080
Is it serious?

98
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,280
It seems she caught a cold

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
and has been in fever.

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,160
I was to give her a lesson.

101
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
And she fell ill.

102
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,600
This is so meant to be.

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,640
Let's check her out.

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes.

105
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
Madam,

106
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,200
you're having a high fever.

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
And they still don't
get you a physician.

108
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
What should we do?

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,680
Your Ladyship.

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
You're excused.

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,360
Yes.

112
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
You must be suffering

113
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
from the illness.

114
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,360
Come on.

115
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
You can drop the act.

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
You'd greet me

117
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,680
every single day

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,480
despite your visceral hatred for me.

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,000
You must have suffered a lot

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,120
all these years.

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,720
I got ill

122
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,920
and you don't get me a physician.

123
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,200
My daughter got ill

124
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
and you don't allow me to see her.

125
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,680
What good does it do you

126
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,040
to treat us

127
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,400
so callously?

128
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
It does me no good.

129
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,680
Shouldn't I owe my disease

130
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,680
to you?

131
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
You don't think I know

132
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,000
how you tried to

133
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,040
irritate me

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,880
and aggravate my illness

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
by revealing the information to me

136
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,200
on purpose?

137
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,760
I just want you

138
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,640
to suffer from

139
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,040
what I'm suffering now.

140
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
You forced me

141
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,560
to do this.

142
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,320
I've been compromising all my life

143
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,920
in the hope

144
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,840
that you'd treat my daughter nicer.

145
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,920
However, you wed her

146
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,030
to a heartless profligate.

147
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,550
She has herself to blame

148
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
for marrying Wang Yu.

149
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,910
And you know what?

150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,960
You ruined Erniang's life.

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,520
I could kill you.

152
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,720
Maybe your illness

153
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,880
is exactly what you deserve.

154
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,600
You think you're miserable?

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
What about me?

156
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
I fell into your trap

157
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,840
despite all my prudence.

158
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,600
Listen,

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm the legal wife
and you're a concubine.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,960
We're meant to be enemies.

161
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,080
In the end,

162
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,040
you won.

163
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,200
I won?

164
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,160
What on earth did I win

165
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,520
in my life?

166
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,220
(The Censorate)

167
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,040
What are you doing here?

168
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,480
Sir,

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
I'd like to

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
ask about something.

171
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,600
What thing?

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,360
Will I get paid

173
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,840
for offering clues?

174
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
You have clues?

175
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,760
That's right.

176
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,800
Well,

177
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm a night watchman
on the east of the city.

178
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,480
I know who killed

179
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,720
Duke Mao's son.

180
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,160
Another liar.

181
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Sir, I mean it.

182
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,160
I saw it with my own eyes.

183
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
Duke Mao's son

184
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,240
had the back of his head injured.

185
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,840
The murderer came up behind him,

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,560
picked up a stone

187
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,080
of this size,

188
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,960
and used it to strike
the back of his head.

189
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,160
And killed him?

190
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,440
Not this time.

191
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,880
Duke Mao's son avoided the attack.

192
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,640
However, the murderer
was very malicious.

193
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,600
He pinned Duke Mao's son

194
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,360
to the ground,

195
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,480
struck the back of his head

196
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,960
with that stone again

197
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,040
and killed him.

198
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,520
One more thing.

199
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,960
Well,

200
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
I saw the murderer's face.

201
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,520
All right, all right,

202
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,800
a likely tale.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,280
I...

204
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
Come on, you should be a storyteller.

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,200
People like you

206
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,960
keep coming all the day,

207
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,400
asking me for a reward.

208
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,960
You should leave now.

209
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,600
Please.

210
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,840
Sir, I was telling the truth.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,880
Get out of here.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm a witness.

213
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,560
Get out of here.

214
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:12,840
Please!

215
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,200
Get out of here.

216
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm a witness!

217
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,540
(Pharmacy)

218
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,040
You...

219
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
I recognize you.

220
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,880
You're the one who killed Wang Yu.

221
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
So, you really saw it.

222
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,160
You are so dead.

223
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Get out!

224
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,960
He is killing me!

225
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,680
Help!

226
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,760
Marquis, Official Li,

227
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,040
you're finally here!

228
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
I was scared to death!

229
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,520
Thank you for helping us
arrest the criminal.

230
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,720
This is your reward.

231
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,840
Thank you, Marquis.
Thank you, Official Li.

232
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,400
So, you killed Wang Yu.

233
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

234
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,440
You have admitted it yourself.

235
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,440
There is no use denying it.

236
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,080
This has got to be

237
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,040
your plot.

238
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,080
There is no witness at all.

239
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,280
I lost my cool

240
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,160
and fell into your trap.

241
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,640
You gave yourself away.

242
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,640
I just don't get it.

243
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
How did you find

244
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
that I killed Wang Yu?

245
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,560
You'll find out

246
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,320
at the court.

247
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,240
Take him away.

248
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.

249
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,280
Marquis, you've been a great help,

250
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,160
or we couldn't have
found the murderer so soon.

251
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,880
Marquis, I understand
the tough situation you are in.

252
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
And I'm gonna be honest with you.

253
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,680
According to postmortem examination,

254
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,120
it turns out

255
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,160
that Wang Yu got his head injured twice.

256
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,560
The second injury

257
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
was the real cause of his death.

258
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,560
A witness said

259
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,420
the concierge of Duke Wei's Mansion

260
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,400
only hit Wang Yu once.

261
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,640
So, did you find

262
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,640
the real murderer?

263
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,440
We could respond by accusing

264
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,360
the concierge of manslaughter.

265
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,720
However,

266
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,920
if the murderer is someone else,

267
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,920
the investigation can
lead to unexpected results.

268
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,520
The forces behind the case
won't let up about it.

269
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,640
That's difficult for us.

270
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,400
We can't close the case

271
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
until we find the real murderer.

272
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,280
That's right.

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,880
What?

274
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
Zhou Xian got arrested?

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,320
How come?

276
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,840
That can't be true.

277
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,440
That can't be true.

278
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
He told me

279
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,240
it went off without a hitch.

280
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,640
How could he be arrested?

281
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
What happened?

282
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,400
Tell me what happened!

283
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Was it because of Xu Lingyi again?

284
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,760
How did he do it?

285
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,200
It was him again.

286
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,160
Now what do we do?

287
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,680
Now what do we do?

288
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,720
I remember you saying

289
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,320
that Zhou Xian was loyal

290
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,800
and would never sell you out.

291
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,120
That's right.

292
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
He will not betray me.

293
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,560
We can keep calm

294
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,480
and reassure Zhou Xian's family.

295
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,520
Greetings, Marquis.

296
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,960
He is the murderer of Wang Yu.

297
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,070
It is him.

298
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,960
He worked for

299
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,160
the parents of Young Madam Ou.

300
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,110
His name is Zhou Xian.

301
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,320
Killing Wang Yu

302
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,240
and getting between us,

303
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,680
the whole thing was set up

304
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
by Young Madam Ou.

305
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I don't believe it.

306
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,200
I know Young Madam Ou well.

307
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,560
She would never do this to me.

308
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,560
I wouldn't believe you anyway.

309
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,400
Young Madam.

310
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
I've seen this man

311
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
at the doorsteps
of Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion.

312
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,260
(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)

313
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,040
He has a big mole

314
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,280
on his face.

315
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,080
That's how I recognize him

316
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,000
at once.

317
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,360
It can't be true.

318
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,920
Young Madam Ou

319
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,880
would never do this to me.

320
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,560
However,

321
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,080
Young Madam Ou

322
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,880
has been avoiding you

323
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,240
ever since then.

324
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,680
So...

325
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
So, it was Young Madam Ou

326
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
who had my husband killed

327
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,280
and

328
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,600
made me believe Ren Kun
was the murderer.

329
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
She manipulated me to create
a disturbance in the Xu family.

330
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
With her goal achieved,

331
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
she refused to see me

332
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,560
and turned her back on me.

333
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,600
I talked to Young Madam Jiang.

334
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,680
Perhaps she was also behind the adoption

335
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
in the Wang family.

336
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,680
Young Madam.

337
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
It turns out...

338
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,520
It turns out

339
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,120
she is behind all this.

340
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,520
She killed my husband.

341
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,640
I lost the baby because of her.

342
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
I fell into her trap.

343
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,120
Erniang!

344
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,000
Erniang!

345
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Erniang, where are you going?

346
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,920
I'm going to disclose her sins

347
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,040
to the rest of the world.

348
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm going to teach her a lesson.

349
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,040
Maybe you should calm down first.

350
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Zhou Xian

351
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,160
has taken all the blame.

352
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,680
He said he killed Wang Yu

353
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,800
for his personal vendetta,

354
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480
distancing himself

355
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,400
from Young Madam Ou.

356
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,040
We can do nothing with her
for the moment.

357
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,120
Erniang,

358
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,120
your goal

359
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
is to find

360
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,600
the real murderer.

361
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,880
Duke Mao

362
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,600
will give you fair treatment.

363
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,600
You don't get to lecture me on it.

364
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,720
I know what to do.

365
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,520
Don't think I will be grateful to you.

366
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,800
You owe me this.

367
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,920
Erniang!

368
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,320
Marquis Yongping

369
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,800
and your sister are an inseparable

370
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,120
and loving couple.

371
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,800
If Shiyi is willing

372
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,000
to speak for you

373
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,320
in front of Marquis Yongping,

374
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,080
he'll certainly listen to her.

375
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Young Madam.

376
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,040
I thought of her as my sister.

377
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
And she fooled and used me.

378
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,880
I'll never get away with it.

379
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Young Madam,

380
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,040
what are you going to do?

381
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
To get what she wants,

382
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,800
she manipulated me

383
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,920
to cause troubles for the Xu family.

384
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,560
Now,

385
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
she'll have a taste

386
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,400
of her own medicine.

387
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,160
Jinlian,

388
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,960
go to Luo family tomorrow morning

389
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,560
to deliver a letter to my brother.

390
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,760
Yes.

391
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,660
(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)

392
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,920
Young Madam, there she is.

393
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:34,700
(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)

394
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,320
You said you were not at home.

395
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,560
Who am I looking at

396
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,080
right now?

397
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I have a lot to deal with

398
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
these days.

399
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,080
It seems my servants

400
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,160
gave you a hard time.

401
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,000
Young Madam Wang, are you here for me?

402
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,040
You can drop your act.

403
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,280
I know about everything.

404
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,520
You killed my husband!

405
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,400
Young Madam Wang,

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
you'd better watch what you say.

407
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,280
In the capital,

408
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,440
both of us enjoy a certain status.

409
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,120
We won't want to be laughed at.

410
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,800
You're not leaving here

411
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
until you tell me everything.

412
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,960
You killed my husband.

413
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,320
You killed my baby.

414
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,560
Today,

415
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,120
you must give me an explanation!

416
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,480
Tell me everything!

417
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:18,920
Zhenxing.

418
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,560
-Let go of me!
-You know...

419
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,040
Are they talking about

420
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,160
Young Madam Ou?

421
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,960
You're not leaving

422
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,360
until you tell me everything.

423
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
What's going on?

424
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,400
Don't you walk away from me!

425
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,960
Wang Yu was killed by Ren Kun.

426
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,640
Why would you frame me?

427
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
Are you crazy?

428
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,280
The murderer has been arrested.

429
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,040
Are you trying to deny it?

430
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,080
I've talked with the murderer.

431
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,880
He worked for your parents.

432
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,120
You had my husband Wang Yu

433
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,520
killed.

434
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,840
And you used me

435
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,720
to stir things up for Marquis Yongping.

436
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,840
You planned all this.

437
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,440
You...

438
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,520
Shut up,

439
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
or I'll get angry with you.

440
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,440
It seemed Wang Yu
was killed by the Zhou family.

441
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,280
Does Young Madam Ou

442
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,880
-You've got to be responsible for it
-have anything

443
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,120
-in front of everybody!
-to do with it?

444
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,040
The lady

445
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,000
arguing with Young Madam Ou

446
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,480
called Wang Yu her husband.

447
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,800
Does that mean...

448
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,560
My apologies.

449
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,040
She is my sister.

450
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,160
The news of her husband's death
has been all around the town.

451
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,960
You must have heard about it.

452
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,520
It turns out

453
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,640
there is inside story about it.

454
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,400
Let go of me! What are you doing?

455
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,760
You killed my husband.

456
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,280
Now you are trying to kill me?

457
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Help! Help!

458
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,200
You two do something!

459
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,960
Help!

460
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,840
Do you want to fight me?

461
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,400
You should check

462
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,280
what you've got.

463
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,040
This is bullying.

464
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,240
You will get more than

465
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,640
just a slap

466
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,600
next time you make a scene.

467
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,800
Erniang!

468
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,840
Zhenxing!

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,040
Young Madam Ou,

470
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,040
what has my sister ever done

471
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,600
to deserve that?

472
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,600
Mr. Luo, I'm glad you're here.

473
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,040
It seems your sister went crazy.

474
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,040
You should bring her home

475
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,640
and get her under control.

476
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,080
Make sure she won't talk nonsense

477
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,920
and frame me anymore.

478
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
Or

479
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,240
I will hold her to account.

480
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,600
Zhenxing, I'm not talking nonsense.

481
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,600
The one who killed my husband

482
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,000
works for her parents.

483
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
Jinlian saw that murderer

484
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,920
at her doorstep.

485
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,040
The murderer did work
for the Zhou family.

486
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,000
But it's personal.

487
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,760
I have nothing to do with it.

488
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,320
You were saying that
Ren Kun was the murderer.

489
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,400
So what? You can't hide it now?

490
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,240
You're not going to be
laughing for long.

491
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,360
The murderer will
sell you out sooner or later.

492
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,800
Stop talking nonsense!

493
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,240
Young Madam Ou,
you asked your servant to kill

494
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,360
and framed someone else.

495
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,200
Did Vice Minister Ou and Minister Zhou

496
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,640
know about it?

497
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,680
You...

498
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,760
Get these troublemakers

499
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,880
out of here.

500
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
Young Madam Ou,

501
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,280
you showed good manners,

502
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,240
as the daughter of the Minister
of Ministry of Rites.

503
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,320
I'm really impressed

504
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,000
today.

505
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,240
It seems we got

506
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
another meddler.

507
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
Who are you?

508
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,080
Mr. Luo and I are classmates.

509
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,840
We both are competent scholars
of the Imperial Academy.

510
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,240
I didn't mean to

511
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,040
interfere in this.

512
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,840
But I saw you

513
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,360
act despicably.

514
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,880
It made me

515
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,000
want to tell it

516
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
to my classmates and colleagues,

517
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
having a discussion

518
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,400
about the rights and wrongs.

519
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,480
How dare you!

520
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,360
Young Madam Ou, say no more.

521
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm sure

522
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,560
the Censorate

523
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,560
will find out the truth.

524
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,620
(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)

525
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,960
Come on, get away.

526
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,760
-Get away.
-Go home.

527
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,360
I know

528
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,600
I can't prove her guilty.

529
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
But I made a scene today,

530
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
and with the help from your classmate,

531
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,920
everyone will know

532
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,120
about her crime.

533
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,160
That will definitely

534
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,880
cause her trouble.

535
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
Let's move on.

536
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,000
Think no more of it.

537
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,200
How have you been

538
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,160
in the Wang family these days?

539
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,680
Did they give you a hard time?

540
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,720
Zhenxing,

541
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,400
thank you for helping me today.

542
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,120
But

543
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,920
let's dispense with

544
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,720
the friendly talks,

545
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,600
shall we?

546
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,160
What are you talking about?

547
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,200
I'm a humble person.

548
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,640
My husband just died.

549
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,680
You don't have to

550
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,480
go out of your way to help me.

551
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,240
You don't think

552
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I know you are doing this

553
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,360
to help the Xu family fight
against the Ou family?

554
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Erniang,

555
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,440
we are related by blood.

556
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,480
We are family.

557
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
How can you say that?

558
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,120
You're a modest person.

559
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,120
I never thought you'd
go with Erniang on this.

560
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,280
The Ou family framed others

561
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,840
and used Erniang.

562
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
They thought

563
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,600
they could push the Luo family around.

564
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
That day,

565
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,960
I got a letter from Erniang,

566
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,040
asking me to help her

567
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,240
punish Young Madam Ou.

568
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,400
So, I came up with this plan.

569
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,920
It could harm the reputation

570
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,040
of the Ou family

571
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,560
and help Erniang vent her anger.

572
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
So,

573
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
you find a classmate

574
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,160
to be the witness.

575
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,680
My classmate

576
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,120
has good judgments

577
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,560
and moral standards.

578
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,800
His words will go around

579
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,200
among civil officers and scholars.

580
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,840
The public opinions can bring pressure

581
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,560
to bear on the Censorate.

582
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,160
That's a good plan.

583
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,040
After this,

584
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,520
though we can't prove
Young Madam Ou's guilty,

585
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
she can't distance herself
from the murderer

586
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
who worked for the Zhou family.

587
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,280
In today's court,

588
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
Duke Wei and Jiang family

589
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,000
put Minister Zhou on the defensive.

590
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,080
And Minister Zhou got scolded

591
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,040
by His Majesty.

592
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,360
Though only his annual salary
was forfeited,

593
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,440
he was caught in the crossfire.

594
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,120
He and the Ou family

595
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,160
would drift apart.

596
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,880
Zhenxing,

597
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,040
how is Erniang now?

598
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,240
I want to see her.

599
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,440
Perhaps not now.

600
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
You know

601
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,000
her nature.

602
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,280
She would say unkind things to you.

603
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,200
Let's wait for some time.

604
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,840
How is mother?

605
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,800
Did she get better?

606
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,240
Not yet.

607
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,800
Erniang's problem has been solved.

608
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,880
Young Madam Jiang seemed about to

609
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,880
approve Zhun's betrothal.

610
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,280
This is a good thing

611
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,560
for our mother.

612
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,560
I hope it can help her

613
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,720
get better.

614
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,500
(Meandering Path)
(Secluded Place)

615
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,440
Did Shiyi say why she wanted to see me?

616
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,840
No, Her Ladyship didn't.

617
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,480
You will find out later, My Lord.

618
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,040
My Lord.

619
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,040
What is this about?

620
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,880
You don't sleep well these days.

621
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,400
I made the mind-soothing soup myself.

622
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,640
Please have some while it's still warm.

623
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,400
I also went to Wang's pastry shop

624
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,040
on the east side

625
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,080
and bought your favorite

626
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,640
jujube pastry.

627
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,040
You must have spent a lot of time

628
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,480
preparing all these things.

629
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,240
That's very thoughtful of you.

630
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,320
This is just a small token
of my gratitude

631
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
for what you've done

632
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,960
for my family.

633
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,240
The murderer has been arrested.

634
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,800
The Wang family made Erniang

635
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
the adopted mother of the child.

636
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,800
I'd like to say thank you
on behalf of my sister.

637
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,320
And thank you for what you've done

638
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,840
for me.

639
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,360
I didn't do this

640
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,360
only for your sake.

641
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,520
I did this also for the Xu family

642
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,440
and Zhun.

643
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,440
You don't have to go out of your way

644
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,360
to thank me.

645
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,400
The betrothal between
Zhun and the Jiang family

646
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,040
has not been affected.

647
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,880
You don't have to worry about it.

648
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,120
What's the problem?

649
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,640
You don't like the food?

650
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,360
I...

651
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,960
I just remembered
I have something to do.

652
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,800
Enjoy the meal yourself.

653
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,080
But...

654
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,200
My Lord, Her Ladyship has
the mind-soothing soup

655
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,480
delivered by Dongqing,

656
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,040
saying that she spent
four hours on the soup

657
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,120
and would like you to take it

658
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,920
before you go to bed.

659
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
Four hours?

660
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,000
That took a lot of work.

661
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,160
But I'm her husband,

662
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,440
who is supposed to be her dearest.

663
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,320
Why would she go out of her way

664
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,320
to thank me?

665
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,040
My Lord,

666
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,440
Her Ladyship
is very concerned about you.

667
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,360
Is she concerned about me

668
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,680
or just doing this

669
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,360
to make it up to me?

670
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,200
Duke Wei, are you for or against

671
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,440
the lifting of sea ban?

672
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,400
Our country boasts vast land
and abundant resources.

673
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,480
Once the sea ban is lifted,

674
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,680
foreign countries might
cast greedy eyes on us.

675
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,040
It's difficult to weigh up
the pros and cons.

676
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,720
That's why I'd remain neutral.

677
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,640
These days,

678
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,880
I can see that the lifting of

679
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,760
the sea ban

680
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,720
is the way to go.

681
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,040
I have no intention

682
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,560
of staying conservative.

683
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,960
Besides, the Ou family supports it

684
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,440
only for their own private gains.

685
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,880
I shall not be on their side.

686
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,840
Duke Wei, you really are insightful.

687
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,560
The coastal area of Fujian
and Zhejiang is mountainous.

688
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,840
Local people depend on
the ocean and trade

689
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,640
for a living.

690
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,720
With the sea ban,

691
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,200
they have to resort to smuggling.

692
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,120
Some of them even got used by pirates.

693
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,640
Until we lift the sea ban,

694
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,040
the livelihood
of local people is at stake,

695
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
and the pirate issue
cannot be eradicated.

696
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,440
That being said,

697
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,120
the lifting of the sea ban

698
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,280
is to be decided by His Majesty.

699
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,680
Or all our efforts will go to waste.

700
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
The country has run a deficit

701
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,120
for many years.

702
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,720
That influences His Majesty's mind.

703
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,600
His Majesty pays more attention
to maritime trade.

704
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,840
Maybe we should take advantage

705
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,800
of the situation.

706
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
I see your point.

707
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,040
With your support

708
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,480
and by going with His Majesty,

709
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,720
the lifting of the sea ban

710
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,480
won't be long.

711
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,840
There is one thing

712
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,440
I would like to know.

713
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,040
Why are you so sure

714
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,480
that I have nothing to do
with Wang Yu's death?

715
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,080
By rights,

716
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
you'd think of me

717
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,880
as the strongest suspect.

718
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
You're a decent person.

719
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't think

720
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,710
you'd revenge on Wang Yu

721
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,760
in a sneaky manner.

722
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,230
Xu Lingyi,

723
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,320
you know me the best.

724
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,000
Father,

725
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,960
I heard that
Minister Zhou of Ministry of Rites

726
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,360
cut ties with us.

727
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,440
Is that true?

728
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,840
Why ask?

729
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,120
Now that we no longer have the support

730
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,230
from Minister Zhou,

731
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,520
there is no point

732
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,630
in clinging to the sea ban.

733
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,080
Maybe we should adapt
to the new situation.

734
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,960
Do you know

735
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,440
what it means

736
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,080
to lift the sea ban?

737
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,120
My years of experience in business

738
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,600
suggests that the lifting
of sea ban

739
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,880
will enhance our interaction

740
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,480
with other countries,

741
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,920
enabling us to

742
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,720
sell our porcelain,

743
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,120
silk and tea abroad.

744
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,000
This will improve

745
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,520
people's lives

746
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,760
and increase

747
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
government's revenue.

748
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
It's a win-win.

749
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,520
Listen,

750
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,960
with the sea ban lifted,

751
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,320
it will be easier

752
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,080
for pirates to attack us.

753
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,120
Trade unimpeded,
bandits would turn into merchants.

754
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,200
Trade impeded,
merchants would turn into bandits.

755
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,320
Pirate issue cannot be eradicated

756
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,760
unless the sea ban is lifted.

757
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,640
The abolishment will bring benefits
to the country and the people.

758
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,320
Father, you might want to reconsider it.

759
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,160
I'm glad

760
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,960
that you're concerned about
state affairs.

761
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,360
However,

762
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,720
this issue might be more complicated

763
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,000
than you think.

764
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,240
I have something to discuss

765
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,160
with Mr. Zhu.

766
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,120
You're excused.

767
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,400
Sure, father.

768
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,240
This is not a small stuff.

769
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,800
If you want to promote him,

770
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
you might need to

771
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
start telling him things.

772
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,600
Your Ladyship,

773
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,920
what made you feel like
playing the zither today?

774
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,840
You always practice embroidery.

775
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,200
You hardly ever play the zither.

776
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,840
His Lordship has done a lot for me.

777
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,640
I want to do something in return.

778
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,280
It seems

779
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,840
I never succeeded

780
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
in making him happy.

781
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,400
So,

782
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,440
Your Ladyship is playing the zither

783
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,200
for the sake of His Lordship.

784
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,680
His Lordship has sworn

785
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,080
not to play the zither again.

786
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,160
But he is so fond of zither music.

787
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,200
It's a shame

788
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,520
he would never touch it again.

789
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,280
Though I couldn't make him

790
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,480
break his promise,

791
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,600
I could play the zither to him

792
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,440
any time he wants.

793
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,280
I suppose that could make him happy.

794
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,720
It's just that playing the zither

795
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,400
is way more difficult than embroidery.

796
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,160
Your Ladyship,
you've spent so much effort on it.

797
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,680
I believe you'll master it soon.

798
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,360
I learned it for a while

799
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
when I was a child.

800
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,880
But I just dabbled.

801
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,000
I forgot a lot about it.

802
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,440
Now I'm determined to make it.

803
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,680
It seems

804
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
I should practice a lot.

805
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,300
♪Among the clouds drifting away,
white birds warble riding wind♪

806
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,180
♪Leaning against the willow,
I view the green hills by the waterside♪

807
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,700
♪Gently, you hang about
In the vicinity of my heart♪

808
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,140
♪With things constantly changing♪

809
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,780
♪Whose love will last forever♪

810
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,540
♪When we met, the answer
came to mind♪

811
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,840
Mother, you're back!

812
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,840
Are you going to Xianling Pavilion?

813
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,960
Yes.

814
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,680
Today is Master Jian's birthday.

815
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,880
The flower-admiring feast
was interrupted

816
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,560
due to Erniang.

817
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
But I know

818
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,120
you've done your best.

819
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,760
Thank you for saying that, Mother.

820
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,160
That's what I should do.

821
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,880
Shiyi,

822
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
you've worked hard

823
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,080
to run this house.

824
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,240
I know all about it.

825
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,160
But

826
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,680
I have to say one thing.

827
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,800
As the wife of Marquis Yongping,

828
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,800
what you say and do

829
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,360
represents the Xu family.

830
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,800
It's inappropriate for you

831
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,320
to appear in public frequently.

832
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,120
I hope you make
the Xu family your priority

833
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,920
and protect the family's image.

834
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,040
Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.

835
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,360
Human hair is resilient.

836
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,360
Hair embroidery is extremely difficult.

837
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,960
But this piece of hair embroidery

838
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,000
is full and exquisite.

839
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,680
It really is

840
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,440
elaborate.

841
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,200
I made it

842
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,680
when I was at the farm.

843
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,800
I've gained some experience.

844
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,080
Now that you find it nice,

845
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,920
I could teach others

846
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,400
about it.

847
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,120
I want you to have it

848
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,960
as a birthday gift.

849
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,960
How do you like it?

850
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,920
Really?

851
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,520
Sure, why not?

852
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,240
This is the best birthday gift

853
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,120
I ever received.

854
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,680
It's so beautiful.

855
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,040
So, how is it going?

856
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,200
How have you been
in the Xu family lately?

857
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,480
His Lordship is nice to me.

858
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,000
But we still got
some stuff to figure out.

859
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,760
I feel like there is a
distance between us.

860
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,640
As for Great Madam...

861
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,280
Did she ask you

862
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,800
to quit Xianling Pavilion again?

863
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,560
Well, I could understand her.

864
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,800
I really want to continue my work

865
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,920
in Xianling Pavilion.

866
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,160
However, I hurt His Lordship

867
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,040
and put him through a lot.

868
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,680
Much has been happening
to the Xu family lately.

869
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,080
I got to care about

870
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
His Lordship's and Mother's feelings.

871
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,160
Perhaps

872
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,800
it's time for me
to quit Xianling Pavilion.

873
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,720
-But...
-It's a lovely bird!

874
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,400
It's beautiful. What kind of bird is it?

875
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,440
Shiyi, wait for a while.

876
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,880
Look!

877
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
What's with the noise outside?

878
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,320
Mr. Ou brought a thrush.

879
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,320
A thrush?

880
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,320
Happy birthday!

881
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,880
Thank you!

882
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,600
Master Jian,

883
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,160
this is the gift

884
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,800
for you.

885
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,680
May it bring joy to your life.

886
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,920
I hope you like it.

887
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,320
This little thrush is singing.

888
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,760
It's so lovely.

889
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,920
It's very thoughtful of you.

890
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,320
You're welcome, Master Jian.

891
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,120
Come over here.

892
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,520
Show him the way

893
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,800
and hang the birdhouse in the courtyard.

894
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,480
Yes.

895
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Mr. Ou...

896
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,560
Master Jian,
do you want to say something?

897
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,880
Well,

898
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,200
Shiyi told me that she intended to

899
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,120
quit Xianling Pavilion.

900
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,520
Shiyi wants to quit?

901
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,480
That's right.

902
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,360
She is the matron of the Xu family.

903
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,760
She has many concerns.

904
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
I understand her.

905
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,760
But

906
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,160
it's a shame for her to quit,

907
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,080
given how good she is at embroidery.

908
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,920
That's right.

909
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,240
I understand her problems.

910
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,120
Besides the pressure

911
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,440
from Great Madam,

912
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,560
I must have made it hard for her.

913
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,120
There is hostility
between the Ou and Xu families.

914
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,560
And many things happened in the past.

915
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,720
We really shouldn't be working together.

916
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,960
It's true

917
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,080
that one of us

918
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,240
should quit Xianling Pavilion.

919
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,720
Lady Luo is bright

920
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,840
and gifted in embroidery.

921
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,880
It would be a shame for her

922
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,680
to quit.

923
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,480
You mean...

924
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,480
In fact, I came here today

925
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,520
to celebrate your birthday

926
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,720
and to tell you

927
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,840
that I am quitting.

928
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,720
What?

929
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,040
Do you also want to

930
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,160
quit Xianling Pavilion?

931
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,800
That's right.

932
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,040
Mr. Ou!

933
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,520
Shiyi.

934
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,360
Madam Xu.

935
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,640
Mr. Ou, that's very nice of you.

936
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,160
But

937
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,280
you joined Xianling Pavilion

938
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,880
because you shared the same interests

939
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,360
with Master Jian.

940
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,680
And without your support,

941
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,320
Xianling Pavilion would never
have come to

942
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,680
where it is now.

943
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,880
You have done nothing wrong.

944
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,200
You shouldn't quit Xianling Pavilion

945
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,880
because of me.

946
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,720
The food is very good.

947
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,480
Yeah.

948
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,160
Thank you for coming

949
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,760
to celebrate my birthday.

950
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,680
Without your support,

951
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,400
Xianling Pavilion would not
be thriving like today.

952
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,160
However,

953
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,240
this may be the last time

954
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,680
we get together like this.

955
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,200
So,

956
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,480
I'd like to propose a toast to you all.

957
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,500
(Unrivaled Beauty with Heavenly Aroma)

958
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,280
My Lord,

959
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,440
this is Her Ladyship's carriage.

960
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,520
My Lord.

961
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,200
Her Ladyship is still out this late.

962
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,760
My Lord, you might

963
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,880
want to take her home.

964
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,920
She has her own plans.

965
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,880
Let's not bother her.

966
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,720
Her Ladyship seldom comes home late.

967
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,560
Something must have

968
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,400
come up.

969
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,040
Curfew is coming.

970
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,600
If something happens,

971
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,640
you will get worried.

972
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,280
All right, let's go in.
