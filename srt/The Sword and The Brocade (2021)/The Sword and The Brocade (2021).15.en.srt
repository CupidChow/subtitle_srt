I'm very sure.

I personally saw it.

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920

I guessed it right indeed.

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,560
If you pour enough rice vinegar

48
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,200
into the water used to wash rice,

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,440
it will remove the moldy smell
in the water.

Those rice

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
was too moldy already.

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Back home,

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,040
we won't even use them

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,000
Rice vinegar

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
can remove the moldy smell of rice,

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,160
but it can't eliminate its toxicity.

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,760
People will die if they eat it.

61
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,680

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,760
Mrs. Zhang

63
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720
is too bold.

Mrs. Zhang

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,600
isn't bold enough.

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,600
Madam.

67
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm afraid we can't
disclose this matter.

68
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,440
After this, this involves His Lordship.

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,200
His Lordship is still young.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
He'll surely get another legal wife
in the future.

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,440
Should we let Concubine Qiao
ascend to position

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,040
making things difficult for you,

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,200
or let the wives help each other

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,440
like a tripartite balance of forces?

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
Which one do you think

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,480
would benefit the Wen family

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
and you more?

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
There's an opportunity
for the Wen family

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,520
to overturn the situation now.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,680
I must think about this carefully.

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,360
How strange.

What's the matter?

85
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,080
I went to the kitchen just now

86
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
to get some porridge for Concubine Wen.

87
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Who knew that the servant in the kitchen

88
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
ran out

89
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,800
and even took the porridge away.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,640
She said that she got it mixed up,

91
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,440
and it will be bad if we'll get
a stomachache after eating it.

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,280
Perhaps something dirty

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,840
got mixed in there.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,800
Qiuhong.

95
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,720

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,960
got mixed up?

97
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,960
Yes.

98
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
What's the matter, Nanny Tao?

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Nothing,

100
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,240
It's nothing.

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,160
Moldy rice?

102
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Nanny Tao.

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
You're so flustered.

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,960
Where are you going?

105
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,920
I... I'm fine.

106
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,080
Oh, right.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,000
You... Do what you have to do.

108
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,000
Do what you have to do.

109
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Do what I have to do?

110
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,760
She's not usually this way.

111
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,560
This is bad.

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,960
What happened?

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Don't be anxious, Madam.

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,560
It's done.

115
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
Really?

116
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
This trick

117
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,720
is amazing.

118
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,480
Next,

119
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,120
we just need to see what will happen.

120
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,120
Oh, right.

121
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm just not sure what Her Ladyship

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,000
will do.

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,560
Her Ladyship has gotten ahold

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
of such a big mistake.

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
If she has the boldness

126
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,160
of the late Her Ladyship back then,

127
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
she'll surely use this opportunity

128
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,120
to defeat Concubine Qiao

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,840
and get back the authority to manage
household affairs.

130
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,640
Before,

131
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,440
the late Her Ladyship was nice
to the Wen family.

132
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Since Her Ladyship is her younger sister,

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,200
she'll surely be easy to get along with
in the future.

134
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,920
So the Wen family can change
our fortunes

135
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
very soon.

136
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,600
Nanny Tao.

137
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,120
You served Yuanniang

138
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
for a long time.

139
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,920
Do you know that the punishment

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
for making a false charge against
a master

141
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,480
isn't just flogging?

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,400
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

143
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,000
If I didn't have any evidence,

144
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,840
how would I dare

145
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,280
make such groundless accusation?

146
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,640
By the way, Your Ladyship,

147
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
you didn't see

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,960
those bags of rice.

149
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,720
Only a thin layer

150
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,680
of good rice is on top of them.

151
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,400
The rest are all moldy.

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,480
It's obvious that someone
tampered with them.

153
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,800
I think

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,320
Concubine Qiao

155
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
has long planned

156
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,040
to make some money on the rice

157
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,680
for the porridge.

158
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,960
Even if she doesn't get enough money
from her usual portion,

159
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,160
the Qiao family is so rich.

160
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,560
She wouldn't lack money.

161
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,280
Why would she do this?

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,520
Your Ladyship, you're thinking
too highly of her.

163
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,440
Who isn't tempted

164
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,400
by money?

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,800
Yes, the Qiao family is rich indeed.

166
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,000
But the Qiao family

167
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
isn't just

168
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,880
hers alone.

169
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,680
Are you sure what you saw
was moldy rice?

170
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,000
Did you see it clearly?

171
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,400
I did.

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,480
If... If I'm speaking nonsense,

173
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,880
I'll... I'll be struck

174
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,960
by lightning.

175
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,920
By the way, I also heard

176
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
that inside the soup kitchen,

177
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,800
there are a lot of grain supplies.

178
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,720
Who else knows about this?

179
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
It seems like

180
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,280
aside from Mrs. Zhang's staff,

181
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm the only one who knows about this.

182
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
How did you find out then?

183
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
Concubine Wen's maid Qiuhong

184
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,880
said that she got the wrong porridge.

185
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
So what if she did?

186
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,800
So I thought

187
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,040
the problem must be with the rice.

188
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
Then I went to the warehouse to check.

189
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,040
By the way,

190
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,400
on my way back,

191
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
I even met Mrs. Zhang's maid,

192
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,920
Xialing.

193
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,640
This is a major matter.

194
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,880
Don't disclose this to anyone.

195
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,160
Come with me to the warehouse.

196
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Mrs. Zhang.

197
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
Mrs. Zhang.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,280
Bad news.

199
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,320
Earlier,

200
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,240
I met Nanny Tao,

201
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,920
who came very flustered

202
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,320
from the direction of the warehouse.

203
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,840
I went inside to take a look.

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,480
Who would have thought
that the door to the warehouse

205
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,480
was open?

206
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,000
I think

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,520
she must already know.

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
Go... Go back now

209
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
and lock the door of the warehouse.

210
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,560
No one can go inside again.

211
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
-Go, hurry.
-All right.

212
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,640
Wait.

213
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,800
Go, open the door of the warehouse.

214
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,320
The key is with Mrs. Zhang.

215
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
Where's Mrs. Zhang?

216
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,320
I don't know.

217
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,520
Your Ladyship.

218
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,880
Let's find someone
to break the door open.

219
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,760
Your Ladyship.

220
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,880
Your Ladyship.

221
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
Your Ladyship, where are you going?

222
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,440
The soup kitchen

223
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,480
is full of moldy rice now.

224
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
If they continue investigating...

225
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,080
You're so bold.

226
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,080
How dare you use moldy rice
to make porridge?

227
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,080
Don't you know

228
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,080
how important this is to Great Madam?

229
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,880
If you need money, just tell me.

230
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
Why did you tamper
with the relief grains?

231
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,320
Madam... Madam, I am wrong.

232
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,880
It's all my son's fault.

233
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,160
He owes a huge debt.

234
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,800
They'll kill him.

235
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,640
How would I dare to tell you about this?

236
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,320
How long have you been using moldy rice?

237
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,440
Two days.

238
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,560
Just two days.

239
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,840
I waited for Great Madam

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
to light the incense at the temple

241
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
before I dared to use it.

242
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,080
I originally thought

243
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,120
about buying some moldy rice
to earn some money

244
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,160
and stop after I earn enough.

245
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
Who would have thought...

246
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,040
Who would have thought
that someone would find out?

247
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,920
Don't you know

248
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,360
that people will die from eating
moldy rice?

249
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,640
If something really happens,

250
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,080
and the government blames us for it,

251
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,440
the entire Xu family
will be dragged down.

252
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,920
His Lordship...

253
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,120
What will His Lordship think of me?

254
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,040
Madam.

255
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,640
Madam, I was wrong.

256
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,960
I dragged you down.

257
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
I'll go to His Lordship now.

258
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,920
I'll seek punishment from His Lordship
and Great Madam.

259
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,640
I'll tell them that it's all my fault,

260
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,880
it has nothing to do with you.

261
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,920
No.

262
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
You're working for me.

263
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,360
I can't evade the responsibility
for this no matter what.

264
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Xiuyuan.

265
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,120
Let's go and borrow rice
from the Qiao family immediately.

266
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,760
We just need to replace the rice

267
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,480
before Luo Shiyi

268
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,760
finds out.

269
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,680
Then we can still redeem the situation.

270
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
This matter cannot be delayed.

271
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,840
Let's go to
the soup kitchen immediately.

272
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,880
Thank you, Madam.

273
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,240
Here, take it.

274
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,520
Here, this is yours.

275
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,480
Thank you.

276
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,480
Line up properly.

277
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Thank you.

278
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,600
Your Ladyship.

279
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,880
Your Ladyship.

280
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,560
If you don't guard the warehouse,

281
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,600
if they remove

282
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,840
the moldy rice,

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,440
we won't have any evidence.

284
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,920
(Disaster Relief)
Here, this is yours.

285
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
Thank you.

286
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,200
Don't push each other. You'll all get some.

287
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,800
You'll all get some.

288
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,160
Line up properly. Don't push each other.

289
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,400
All right, next.

290
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
Come to the front.

291
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,360
Thank you.

292
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,800
Don't push each other.

293
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,480
Where are the stored grains
from the soup kitchen?

294
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,600
Thank you.

295
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,760
Next.

296
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,800
Since I'm already here,

297
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,080
I already know.

298
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,000
You're just following instructions,

299
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
I can opt not to hold you responsible.

300
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,920
But if you don't tell me now,

301
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,400
do you know what crime
you'll be charged with?

302
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,960
Tell me.

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
Over there.

304
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,440
Your Ladyship.

305
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,360
Your Ladyship.

306
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,800
Your Ladyship.

307
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,640
Why are you here?

308
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,240
If you want to know

309
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,560
the situation of the refugees,

310
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,720
you can ask me directly.

311
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,040
You don't need to personally come here.

312
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,840
What you hear may be false,
but what you see for yourself is true.

313
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,240
Disaster relief is a very
important matter.

314
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
I want to see it for myself

315
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,480
before I can feel at ease.

316
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,960
Please move aside.

317
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,120
Next.

318
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
It's just some rice.

319
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,120
Why can't I see it?

320
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,160
Of course there's nothing

321
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
that can't be seen.

322
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,280
It's just that

323
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,760
Great Madam told me to handle

324
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,880
the disaster relief.

325
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,600
Your Ladyship.

326
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,520
It's better if you don't interfere.

327
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,880
Madam.

328
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,200
Great Madam told you to handle

329
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
this matter indeed.

330
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,160
But don't forget

331
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,880
your status.

332
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,360
You're just a concubine after all.

333
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,480
How dare you tell Her Ladyship

334
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
what to do?

335
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,160
Move aside.

336
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,520
Your Ladyship.

337
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,200
You're using your status

338
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,200
to overstep your authority.

339
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,680
Are you doubting Concubine Qiao

340
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,120
or Great Madam?

341
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,800
In front of Her Ladyship,

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,360
who allowed you to interrupt
the conversation?

343
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,640
Your Ladyship, if I'm overstepping,

344
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,520
you can punish me back at the mansion.

345
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,080
But if you

346
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,760
break the rule
that Great Madam set today

347
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,480
and insist on barging in,

348
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,320
you can do it...

349
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,960
over my dead body.

350
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,840
Mrs. Zhang.

351
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,996
(Xuanya Painting and Calligraphy)

352
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,848
(Fabric Shop)

353
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
Whose rice is this?

354
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,840
Don't take them.

355
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,240
Don't take them!

356
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Stop taking them!

357
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,960
Don't take them!

358
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,080
Your Ladyship.

359
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,280
Here is the thing.

360
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
Look at all the people here.

361
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,400
If you insist on doing what you want,

362
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
and it turns into a big deal,

363
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,120
it's not good, right?

364
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,080
You two

365
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,480
keep stopping me.

366
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,760
What is your intention?

367
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,600
Nanny Tao,

368
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,560
Dongqing, Amber.

369
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,480
Move.

370
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,440
Move.

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,280
Move.

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,400
Move.

373
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,080
Madam.

374
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,080
Madam.

375
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,800
Madam.

376
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,120
Madam.

377
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
-Madam.
-What happened?

378
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,280
There was an accident along the way.

379
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,840
The rice is gone.

380
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,480
Madam, what should we do?

381
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,120
Madam.

382
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,960
Your Ladyship.

383
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Your Ladyship, take a look.

384
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,920
All these...
All these are bags of moldy rice.

385
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,800
Look.

386
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
How dare they tamper
with the relief grains.

387
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,640
Lianfang, you're so bold.

388
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,120
Well...

389
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,560
Mrs. Zhang.

390
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,520
What exactly is going on?

391
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,480
Your Ladyship, don't be angry.

392
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,120
I suddenly thought about doing that.

393
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I was blinded by money.

394
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,520
The moldy rice

395
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,640
has nothing to do with Concubine Qiao.

396
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,000
It was all me.

397
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,560
Your Ladyship,
please investigate it clearly.

398
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,040
If it had nothing to do with her,

399
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,000
why did she stop me earlier?

400
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,800
Your Ladyship, please be discerning.

401
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
No eggs can remain unbroken
when the nest is overturned.

402
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,560
I definitely won't do anything

403
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,960
that will harm the Xu family.

404
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,440
Mrs. Zhang.

405
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
I trusted you so much.

406
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,920
I can't believe you committed

407
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,080
such a grave crime behind my back.

408
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,920
Your Ladyship.

409
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,080
I didn't discipline her well.

410
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,720
Your Ladyship, please punish me.

411
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,600
Your Ladyship, it's all my fault.

412
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,200
I dragged Concubine Qiao down.

413
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,920
I dragged down the Xu family.

414
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,280
This isn't the time

415
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,840
to listen to you admit your faults here.

416
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
This is a grave matter.

417
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,360
If something goes wrong,

418
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,720
I won't spare you.

419
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,120
How much rice do we still have at home?

420
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,160
If we bring them all here,

421
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,240
how many days will it last?

422
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,160
At the mansion,

423
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,160
including the villa,

424
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,640
we still have excess grains.

425
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,880
However, there are too many
refugees.

426
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,640
Even if we bring it all here,

427
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,240
it won't last for more than a few days.

428
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,640
Your Ladyship, since we don't have
enough grains,

429
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,760
after the grains are used up,

430
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,080
let's stop giving out porridge.

431
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,600
No.

432
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,880
If we stop giving out porridge,

433
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,000
the refugees must endure hunger again.

434
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,760
Besides,

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,359
His Majesty is already aware

436
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,520
that we're giving out porridge
for disaster relief.

437
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,960
If we stop it hastily,

438
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm afraid that it might be considered
as deceiving His Majesty.

439
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,079
No matter what happens,

440
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
we must continue this soup kitchen.

441
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,160
Lianfang.

442
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
Go home immediately

443
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,920
and bring all the rice over.

444
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,440
Let's see how many days it will last.

445
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,359
Then let's think about
what else we can do.

446
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,560
Yes.

447
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,960
Go.

448
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,280
Let's go.

449
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,600
Amber, bring a few people

450
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,560
to buy rice in rice shops.

451
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,880
Buy as much as you can.

452
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
Remember, be careful.

453
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,240
Don't let others find out.

454
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,560
Yes, Your Ladyship.

455
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,960
Your Ladyship.

456
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,920
What should we do
with all the moldy rice?

457
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,120
Mrs. Zhang suddenly brought

458
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,480
so much moldy rice.

459
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,360
I keep thinking
that there's something fishy.

460
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,760
Leave them here first.

461
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,560
We'll remove them later on.

462
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,200
Yes, Your Ladyship.

463
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,160
Nanny Tao.

464
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,840
Tell them to throw away the porridge
in the pots.

465
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,120
We'll cook some more
when the new rice arrives.

466
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,920
Your Ladyship.

467
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,280
Even if this is moldy rice,

468
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,520
eating it one or two times

469
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,400
won't cause any troubles.

470
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,280
Nothing happened

471
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,840
in the past few days.

472
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,880
I'm afraid that if we stop
giving out porridge,

473
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
the refugees will cause trouble.

474
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,840
We're lucky nothing happened.

475
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,560
Cook more after the new rice arrives.

476
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes.

477
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,640
What's going on?

478
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,760
Why aren't they giving out porridge?

479
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,080
Have they run out?

480
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,200
Don't be ridiculous.

481
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
Marquis Yongping said that he'd
give out porridge,

482
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,280
so he won't forget about us.

483
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,080
Right.

484
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,800
Don't be anxious.

485
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,160
The porridge will be ready soon.

486
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Everyone can get some.

487
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,600
Wait for a while.

488
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,200
Everyone can get some.

489
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
They're so nice.

490
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,800
Line up to get porridge.

491
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,760
The porridge is here.

492
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,920
Don't be impatient.

493
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,080
Line up.

494
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Don't push each other.

495
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,240
Line up to get porridge.

496
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,920
Don't push each other.

497
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,520
Don't push each other.

498
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Everyone can get some.

499
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,040
Thank you.

500
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,600
Hurry, make it quick.

501
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,440
Dongqing, come.

502
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,760
Everyone can get some.
Don't push each other.

503
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,880
Thank you.

504
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,160
Take care.

505
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,160
Thank you.

506
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
Thank you.

507
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,387
(Mansion of Xu)

508
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,080
Your Ladyship.

509
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,480
We found information
about the moldy rice.

510
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Is there any problem?

511
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,840
It was bought from Jiang's Rice Shop.

512
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,920
But coincidentally,

513
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,120
the brother of the keeper
of Jiang's Rice Shop

514
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,000
works for

515
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,040
Marquis Jingyuan.

516
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,520
Marquis Jingyuan?

517
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,040
The Ou family?

518
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,360
Your Ladyship, you haven't been
in the Xu family for long.

519
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,760
Perhaps you're not aware.

520
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,080
The Xu and Ou families

521
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,360
have a deep feud.

522
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,840
Back then, the death of the late Marquis
and his second son

523
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,480
was related to the Ou family.

524
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,800
In that case,

525
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,160
it's very possible that the Ou family

526
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,880
planned the moldy rice incident.

527
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,040
Your Ladyship, Mrs. Zhang definitely
won't be bold enough

528
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,520
to collude with the Ou family.

529
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,400
Whether she colluded with them or not,

530
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,240
His Lordship will be the judge of that.

531
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,040
What's important now

532
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,320
is that if the Ou family
was really the one who did this,

533
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,520
if no trouble happens,

534
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,320
they definitely
won't just give up easily.

535
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
Now, things only seem calm
on the surface.

536
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,840
Perhaps

537
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
the trouble will come later.

538
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,480
Your Ladyship, you're right.

539
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
If the Ou family takes advantage of this
to cause trouble,

540
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,040
the entire Xu family

541
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,560
will be in chaos.

542
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,160
Your Ladyship.

543
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,800
What should we do then?

544
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,040
Your Ladyship.

545
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,920
Your Ladyship, we went
to almost all the rice shops

546
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,000
in the entire capital.

547
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,640
But the rice

548
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,320
was almost sold out.

549
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,520
Rice can't be bought

550
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,120
at such a huge capital?

551
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,120
Someone is definitely playing tricks.

552
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,520
Which are the largest grain shops

553
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
in the capital?

554
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,040
Ruixing Grains,

555
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
Shengping Grains,

556
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,720
and Fengping Grains.

557
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,840
Amber.

558
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,560
Go to those shops to check.

559
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,000
It doesn't matter if the rice is
more expensive than the market price.

560
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,120
Yes.

561
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Lianfang.

562
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,800
I'll give you a chance

563
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,120
to redeem yourself.

564
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,560
Can you borrow some rice
from the Qiao family?

565
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,480
Your Ladyship.

566
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,080
It's not that I don't want to help.

567
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,440
Before this,

568
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,680
I've already asked my family

569
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,440
to provide some rice.

570
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,920
But I didn't expect

571
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,680
that an accident would occur
along the way.

572
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
Currently, my family

573
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,240
has no extra rice

574
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,760
to lend to me anymore.

575
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm afraid it wasn't an accident.

576
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,640
Could it be that the Ou family
was also behind it?

577
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,480
The situation is very urgent now,

578
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,120
and His Lordship happens to be away.

579
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,640
Great Madam and Second Madam

580
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,160
also went to Ci'an Temple.

581
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
How can we deal

582
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
with such a grave matter?

583
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,800
Where's Lingkuan?

584
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,160
Is he back?

585
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,280
No.

586
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,800
Princess Danyang said

587
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,920
that after His Lordship left,

588
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,840
he went to watch a Chinese Opera
outside the city.

589
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,960
I'm afraid he won't be back

590
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,200
in a few days.

591
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,880
Steward Bai.

592
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,120
Take care of the soup kitchen first.

593
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,760
Don't disclose this at home

594
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,240
in order to avoid panic.

595
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,360
I'll think of something.

596
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Yes, Your Ladyship.

597
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,680
Your Ladyship, is there anything

598
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,160
we can help with?

599
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,400
Your Ladyship.

600
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,360
If you need my help,

601
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,960
please tell me.

602
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,920
The most important thing now

603
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,000
is to find new rice

604
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,400
to replace the moldy rice.

605
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,640
Otherwise, we're in big trouble.

606
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,640
Master Lixing.

607
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
Marquis Yongping's wife

608
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,960
found out about the moldy rice

609
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,800
and replaced them.

610
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,200
Replaced them?

611
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,840
She can replace them temporarily.

612
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,560
Can she replace them for long?

613
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,880
I want to see

614
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,160
if there's an endless supply of rice

615
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
in the Xu family's mansion.

616
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,720
As for the Marquis Yongping's wife,

617
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,640
you're referring to the new legal wife
Xu Lingyi just married?

618
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,880
Exactly.

619
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,200
I heard that the new legal wife

620
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,960
isn't well-liked in the Xu family.

621
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,440
A concubine

622
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,400
is even the one managing
the household affairs.

623
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,120
Why is she involved in this?

624
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,280
I'm not sure

625
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,720
about the details.

626
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,720
The rice in the city...

627
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,280
According to your instructions,

628
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,560
we've gotten all of them.

629
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,040
The roads are blocked due to the flood.

630
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,000
The food from outside can't be
transported here.

631
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,560
They won't be able
to sustain this for long.

632
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,600
Watch them carefully.

633
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,080
You're very discerning.

634
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,240
They're just

635
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
dragging out a feeble existence.

636
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
When they use up all their extra rice,

637
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,480
the Xu family

638
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,600
won't be able to overturn
the situation again.

639
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,520
Nice work with the Qiao family's
horse carriage.

640
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,560
Thank you.

641
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,760
After Marquis Jingyuan comes back

642
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,960
from his inspection in Fujian

643
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,600
and sees your great accomplishment,

644
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,840
he'll surely be happy.

645
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,400
I'm congratulating you in advance.

646
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,480
This smells so good.

647
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,040
Here.

648
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,760
Hey.

649
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,800
Are you all right?

650
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,200
Are you all right?

651
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,080
All right.

652
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,320
Let him rest for a while.

653
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,760
Come.

654
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,920
Help him get some rest over there.

655
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,200
This way.

656
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,240
Here.

657
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,080
Give him some water.

658
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Rest for a while.

659
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,600
Everyone.

660
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,520
Rest for a while if you feel tired.

661
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,600
Sit down for a while.

662
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,880
My Lord.

663
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,240
General Fu.

664
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
For the sake of the disaster relief,

665
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,320
you haven't rested

666
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,360
for many days.

667
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,320
Take good care of yourself.

668
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm fine.

669
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,520
The weather is very hot.

670
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
There are many rats and insects
in the flood.

671
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
It's very dirty.

672
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,560
The refugees
are mostly women and children.

673
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,520
I'm afraid that after what happened,

674
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,080
they'll get sick.

675
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,760
When we get to the base,

676
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,880
tell the physician who came with us

677
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,800
to make some medicines
to prevent sickness

678
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,120
and deliver it to the refugees.

679
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,280
My Lord, you're very thoughtful.

680
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,040
Give it to me.

681
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,880
General Fu.

682
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,840
Look.

683
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
His new shoes are so wet,

684
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,800
and His Lordship is still smiling.

685
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,760
What do you know?

686
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,800
That's called

687
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,000
the drinker's mind isn't on the cup,

688
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,720
but on Her Ladyship.

689
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,800
He's probably thinking
about Her Ladyship.

690
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,480
So you understand?

691
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,280
Hurry.

692
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,080
You know

693
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,640
what to do next, right?

694
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,600
But...

695
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,640
But what?

696
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,800
Don't you want your son

697
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,920
to stay alive?

698
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Take that

699
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,120
to guarantee

700
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
that nothing will go wrong.

701
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,000
Here, this is yours.

702
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,600
Here.

703
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,680
All right.

704
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,400
Thank you.

705
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,520
Line up properly.

706
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:14,920
Thank you.

707
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,400
Take it slow.

708
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,360
Line up properly.

709
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,640
You evil people.

710
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,360
What kind of rice

711
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,840
did you give us?

712
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,640
After my dad took the porridge,

713
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,040
he's been foaming at the mouth.

714
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,680
Our stomachs are aching.

715
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,800
Could it be that you're giving us

716
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,320
moldy rice?

717
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,520
If you don't give us
an explanation today,

718
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,920
we won't leave.

719
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,480
Everyone.

720
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,440
Give us an explanation.

721
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,040
Everyone.

722
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,120
There's no problem with the rice.

723
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,720
May I ask

724
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
if you have other illnesses?

725
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,440
Of course not.

726
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,560
Did you get your porridge here?

727
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,600
I heard that Marquis Yongping

728
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,040
has always been an honest official.

729
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,840
We came here

730
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,080
because of him.

731
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,560
Right.

732
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
How can he give us

733
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,560
moldy rice?

734
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,600
It's true.

735
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,240
We ate the Xu family's rice.

736
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,600
That was why our stomachs
started aching.

737
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,560
In the past few days,

738
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,160
we never

739
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,520
left this place.

740
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,680
If you all don't believe us,

741
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,760
go inside and see

742
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,720
if they're using

743
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,000
moldy rice or not.

744
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,040
Calm down, everyone!

745
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,040
Don't believe in rumors.

746
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
Don't believe in rumors!

747
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,583
(Disaster Relief)

748
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,720
Don't panic.

749
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,920
Your Ladyship.

750
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,920
Don't be scared, everyone.

751
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,760
There's no problem with the rice.

752
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,600
Eat them without any worries.

753
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,280
If you still have doubts,

754
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
I can eat with you.

755
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,160
Who are you?

756
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,240
Who are you?

757
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,760
Right.

758
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,800
She's Marquis Yongping's wife.

759
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,720
So what if you're

760
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,480
Marquis Yongping's wife?

761
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,560
Who knows if what you're saying
is the truth or not?

762
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,320
Make my father well first.

763
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,440
Father.

764
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,400
Father, how are you feeling?

765
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,920
He ate your moldy rice.

766
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,640
If there's no problem with your rice,

767
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,240
do you dare to show it to us?

768
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,760
Yes, show us!

769
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,880
Show us!

770
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,480
Madam Xu.

771
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,840
Could it be that there's
really a problem

772
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,080
with the porridge you gave us?

773
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,640
Why are you still talking to them?

774
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,960
Turn this soup kitchen over.

775
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,560
We can surely find the moldy rice!

776
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,000
Right.

777
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,360
Right!

778
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,280
Let's go inside and find them!

779
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,600
Wait.

780
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,480
Don't panic.

781
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,400
Don't panic.

782
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,400
Your Ladyship.

783
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,360
Shiliu.

784
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,600
Shiliu.

785
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,080
Shiliu.

786
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,240
Stand up first.

787
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,880
Are you all right?

788
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,640
I'm fine, it's just a scratch.

789
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,440
Your Ladyship, are you all right?

790
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,480
I'm fine.

791
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,920
Look, everyone. I found it.

792
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,000
Just take a look and see

793
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,560
if it's moldy rice or not.

794
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,760
All of this is good rice.

795
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
It is the good rice.

796
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,320
Yes, it is the good rice.

797
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,160
It is the good rice.

798
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,960
Did we

799
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,400
falsely accuse them then?

800
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,360
This isn't moldy rice.

801
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
This is the good rice.

802
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,440
Good rice.

803
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:49,880
It is the good rice.

804
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,720
Take a look.

805
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
This is good white rice.

806
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,440
We've misunderstood.

807
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,800
I knew it.

808
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
The Xu family

809
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,000
won't do such a thing.

810
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
Good rice.

811
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
All are bags of good rice.

812
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,520
Everyone can feel at ease now, right?

813
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,280
Continue lining up for porridge then.

814
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,080
Line up.

815
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,440
Come on.

816
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,160
Come, line up properly.

817
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,360
Come, one by one.

818
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,320
Everyone can get some.

819
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
The Ou family is unpredictably
insidious in doing things.

820
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
We must guard against them.

821
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,800
Dongqing.

822
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,040
Take this land title

823
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
to Master Jian.

824
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,880
Master Jian knows a lot of people.

825
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,400
See if she can find

826
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,640
someone with a lot of extra rice

827
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,720
to make a deal.

828
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
I'm willing to use an acre of farmland

829
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,120
in exchange for six kilograms of rice.

830
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,960
We can get 120 kilograms of rice with these.

831
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,320
But Your Ladyship,

832
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,840
these are your dowries.

833
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,680
We're in imminent danger.

834
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,760
We can't think
about those things anymore.

835
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,400
You must be careful.

836
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,920
Don't let anyone find out.

837
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,604
(Land Title)

838
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,520
Hurry.

839
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,200
Place that over there.

840
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Be careful.

841
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,440
In that case,

842
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,160
they must have borrowed some rice

843
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,280
from somewhere else.

844
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,680
That's fine.

845
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,320
Even if they borrow from people
in the entire capital,

846
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,080
they won't be able to get much

847
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,440
for their needs.

848
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,080
They're just dragging out
a feeble existence.

849
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,720
You're right.

850
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,360
They won't last long.

851
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,200
If the Xu family stops
giving out porridge,

852
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,640
those refugees

853
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,720
surely won't just give up easily.

854
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,120
When that time comes,

855
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
they can't hide

856
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,000
their moldy rice any longer.

857
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,200
I can't believe Xu Lingyi's wife

858
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,880
lasts this long.

859
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,880
I've belittled her.

860
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,880
Tell them to watch
the soup kitchen closely.

861
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,840
Don't let them get any chance

862
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,080
to remove the moldy rice.

863
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,040
Yes.

864
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,120
If the Ou family can't
cause us trouble today,

865
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,320
they'll surely find another opportunity.

866
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,240
However,

867
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,400
our rice supply now

868
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,000
is only enough for a couple of days.

869
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,000
We must find

870
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,320
enough new rice.

871
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,680
But the Ou family

872
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,400
just wants everyone to know
about the moldy rice.

873
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,680
We can just move

874
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,120
the moldy rice away secretly.

875
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,080
They were even watching

876
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,640
the Qiao family's horse carriage
that was supposed to bring rice.

877
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,200
And they spent so much money

878
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,680
to buy all the rice in the city.

879
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,640
How can they let us

880
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,280
move the moldy rice away so smoothly?

881
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,400
If we really moved the moldy rice,

882
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,360
perhaps

883
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,960
they'd catch us in the act.

884
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,080
I wonder

885
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,640
what happened with Amber.

886
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,800
Alms.

887
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,080
You are so kind.

888
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,880
Give us some food.

889
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,840
It's mine.

890
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,207
(Wine)

891
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,760
Don't take what's mine.

892
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:48,360
Give it to me.

893
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:48,999
Give it to me.

894
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:51,583
(Vinegar)

895
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,720
Move.

896
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,959
Give it to me.

897
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,200
Give it to me.

898
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,600
Stop taking it away.

899
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,760
Stop taking it away.

900
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,200
Give me some food.

901
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,680
After just a few years,

902
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,399
the capital changed so much.

903
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,760
There are so many refugees.

904
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,680
The flooding disaster this time

905
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,080
must be serious.

906
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,640
Young Master, should we go
to the shop first?

907
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,439
There's no rush.

908
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,280
Alms.

909
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,880
Alms.

910
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,439
Please.

911
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,560
I really need it urgently.

912
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,479
My master really needs it.

913
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,360
(Fengping Grains)
I told you many times.

914
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,880
No matter how much
you're willing to pay,

915
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,400
we won't sell our rice to you.

916
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,480
Be nice.

917
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,600
Let me in.

918
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,080
I really need it urgently.

919
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,960
Can you let me in?

920
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,920
Are you done yet?

921
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,960
Young lady, are you all right?

922
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,840
I'm fine.

923
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,080
Thank you, sir.

924
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:06,243
(Fengping Grains)

925
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,240
Why do you need to buy rice
so urgently?

926
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,160
My master

927
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,360
needs rice for disaster relief.

928
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,080
But the keeper

929
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,720
won't sell me rice

930
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,120
no matter what.

931
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,480
Most likely,

932
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,160
the keeper is afraid
that you're buying rice

933
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,200
to sell them at a high price
and harm the citizens.

934
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,080
That's why he's not willing
to sell them to you.

935
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,160
Why would we do that?

936
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,560
My master is...

937
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,720
My master

938
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,520
won't do

939
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,960
such a terrible thing.

940
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
Since they're willing to buy rice
at a high price,

941
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,880
they're surely not people
who will pull tricks.

942
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,080
Come with me inside.

943
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,160
But...

944
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,440
(Grains)

945
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,604
(Rice)

946
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,600
Young lady.

947
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,760
You think I really won't
get physical with you,

948
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,560
do you?

949
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,400
Sir.

950
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,640
Sell this young lady

951
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,040
the rice that she wants.

952
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,560
Follow the market price.

953
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,840
You're so arrogant.

954
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,480
Don't you see

955
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,440
what kind of place this is?

956
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,320
Can you act so impetuously here?

957
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,120
(Ou)

958
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,520
Sir, you...

959
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,720
Young lady.

960
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,800
How much rice do you want?

961
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,560
We'll sell them at the market price.

962
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,440
Really?

963
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,760
Thank you, sir.

964
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,760
Thank you, sir.

965
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,200
Dongqing.

966
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,000
Look, we're out of rice.

967
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,200
Right.

968
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,000
What should we do?

969
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,480
Your Ladyship.

970
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,680
Our good rice is all used up.

971
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,000
Only moldy rice is left.

972
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,520
If we can't give out more porridge,

973
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,320
we can only shut down the soup kitchen.

974
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,360
The Wang family's soup kitchen

975
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,480
might still have some extra rice.

976
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,040
What if

977
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,840
we lead the refugees

978
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,920
over there first?

979
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,920
Perhaps we can control

980
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,080
the chaotic situation.

981
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,080
No.

982
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
All the Marquis in the capital

983
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,040
are providing disaster relief according
to His Majesty's imperial edict.

984
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,640
Each family is responsible
for one soup kitchen.

985
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,560
Soldiers are guarding between each area.

986
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,600
If chaos occurs

987
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,720
and they investigate it,

988
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
I'm afraid we won't be able

989
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,520
to hide the moldy rice.

990
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,360
When will you give out porridge?

991
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,400
Give them out.

992
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:29,840
Is there rice?

993
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,360
Everyone, quiet down.

994
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,000
Let me tell you, there's no more rice.

995
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
There's no rice.

996
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,920
Be kind.

997
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,360
Give the children some porridge.

998
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,960
They're starving.

999
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,880
We want porridge.

1000
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,000
There is so much rice.

1001
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Why won't you cook them?

1002
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:50,840
Right.

1003
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,680
There is so much rice.

1004
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,040
Why won't you cook them?

1005
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,040
Your Ladyship.

1006
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,960
Once people get hungry,

1007
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,040
they're capable of doing anything.

1008
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,080
Based on the situation outside,

1009
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm afraid they'll cause trouble.

1010
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,760
At a time like this,

1011
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,920
your safety is the priority.

1012
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,600
Go back to the mansion
and avoid them first.

1013
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,560
No.

1014
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,640
In times like these,

1015
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,080
I can't leave all the more.

1016
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,360
Your Ladyship.

1017
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,280
We haven't eaten yet.

1018
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,640
We're all waiting.

1019
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,040
I'm apologizing

1020
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,800
to everyone.

1021
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,080
We didn't watch the relief grains well,

1022
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,560
and rats got to them.

1023
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,600
We're afraid that you'll get sick
if you eat them.

1024
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,840
I've already sent people
to get new rice.

1025
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,280
Please be patient and wait for a while.

1026
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,680
How can we wait?

1027
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,320
Right.

1028
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,360
The children can't wait.

1029
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,160
What should we do?

1030
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,360
So what if the rats got to them?

1031
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:55,880
Right, Madam Xu.

1032
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,640
We're farmers,

1033
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,280
we're not that particular.

1034
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,640
-I want to eat.
-Right.

1035
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,640
You can just feed the children first.

1036
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,160
Yes, feed the children first.

1037
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,280
Please be patient.

1038
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
No.

1039
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,440
I'll stay here

1040
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,800
and wait together with you all.

1041
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,400
If new rice doesn't arrive,

1042
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,080
you can come to me.

1043
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,880
If it doesn't arrive,

1044
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,280
we'll starve to death then.

1045
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,120
Everyone!

1046
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,800
Everyone!

1047
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,120
Let me say something!

1048
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,360
Since Madam Xu

1049
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,920
already said that,

1050
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,280
so what if we wait

1051
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,080
just a bit longer?

1052
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,960
Let's wait.

1053
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,960
-Yes.
-Right.

1054
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,120
Master Lixing, I don't understand.

1055
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,000
Why don't we let

1056
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,720
the people we've arranged

1057
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
charge into the soup kitchen directly

1058
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,320
and bring the moldy rice out?

1059
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,520
Then we'll have the evidence too.

1060
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,720
The Xu family won't be able
to deny it any longer.

1061
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,360
I can't incite the refugees
to go on a riot.

1062
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,520
Even if our people

1063
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,240
take the moldy rice out,

1064
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,960
it's unavoidable for them
to leave a trace.

1065
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Perhaps

1066
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,360
Xu Lingyi will even make countercharges
against us,

1067
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,520
and say

1068
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,920
that we've exchanged the rice
to frame him.

1069
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,360
You're right.

1070
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,320
I'm too impatient.

1071
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,120
We've been fighting with the Xu family
for so many years.

1072
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,440
We can wait a bit longer.

1073
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,920
Yes.

1074
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,520
Sir, it's up ahead.

1075
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,240
Hurry.

1076
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,680
Wait.

1077
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,960
Sir, let's go another way.

1078
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,320
We've been waiting for so long.

1079
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,680
When exactly will you

1080
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,360
give out porridge?

1081
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
-Right.
-When will you give out porridge?

1082
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,080
Everyone, listen to me.

1083
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,960
Stop listening to her nonsense.

1084
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,560
No new rice will arrive.

1085
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,440
I heard

1086
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,960
that they're keeping the rice

1087
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,960
to sell them at a high price.

1088
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,760
How can these rich people

1089
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,640
really care about us?

1090
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,480
That's nonsense.

1091
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,360
Right.

1092
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,720
Liars.

1093
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,560
They're liars.

1094
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,440
Your Ladyship.

1095
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,240
Don't listen to gossip.

1096
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,680
I guarantee on behalf of the Xu family

1097
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,880
that within the disaster period,

1098
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,800
every one of you

1099
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,960
will have food to eat.

1100
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,400
Where's the food?

1101
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,320
Don't listen to her lies.

1102
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,320
Let's fill our stomachs first.

1103
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,040
Let's go inside to get some rice!

1104
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,360
Let's go!

1105
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,600
Everyone, calm down.

1106
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,920
Everyone, calm down.

1107
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:23,920
Move!

1108
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,640
Your Ladyship!

1109
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,680
Don't push.

1110
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,760
Your Ladyship.

1111
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,240
Don't take them!

1112
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,760
Move.

1113
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,560
You can't take them!

1114
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,960
Don't push each other.

1115
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
-Give it to me.
-Go away.
