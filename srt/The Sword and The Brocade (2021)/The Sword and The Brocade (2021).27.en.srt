to the embroidery girls.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,600
Shiyi.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,400
Teacher.

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,560
I was worried about you.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
You're finally here.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,520
Don't worry.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,880
I'm all right.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,840
Good.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,400
Let's talk there.

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
Xianling Pavilion's reputation
has been damaged

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
and it has lost
quite a few embroidery girls.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,960
It's all because of me.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Don't worry, Teacher,

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
I'll cover the loss.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,880
This is not your fault.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,160
You see this place as a treasure trove.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
You must feel worse than I do.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Besides, you got set up.

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
I don't blame you.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,000
In any case,

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,480
I am the cause of all this.

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
I should compensate you

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
for the loss.

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,640
Actually,

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
I noticed long ago

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,280
that embroidery was not

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,240
just a hobby for you.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,360
You're willing to endeavor for it.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
You're willing to explore and improve.

49
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,520
Would you like

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,440
to manage Xianling Pavilion with me?

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,720
The compensation you are offering

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
is considered to be
your investment in it.

53
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,080
Manage Xianling Pavilion with you?

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
You'll spend more time

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,360
doing embroidery.

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,200
You'll explore and study

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,360
with the people

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,760
who share your goal.

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Shiyi,

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,240
you've always wanted

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,480
to stand on your own feet.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,680
How about you
make a career out of embroidery?

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,640
That's a good idea.

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,200
But...

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,600
Does your family disapprove?

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,360
(Whatever you want to do,)

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000
(I will support you.)

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
Nobody disapproves.

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
Then it is a deal.

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
I'd appreciate it

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,880
if you could help me in the future.

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,040
You never know.

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
Maybe you'll be

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
helping me.

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,480
It is only right for the student

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
to help her teacher.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
What a sweet thing to say.

78
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,480
How do I prove my love?

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,080
With this bracelet.

80
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,360
Young Master.

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
You went through all the trouble

82
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,000
to acquire this bracelet,

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,160
and traveled day and night

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,760
to arrive at the capital
before the Qixi Festival.

85
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
But your efforts

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
are wasted.

87
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,640
What do you mean?

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,720
Is Lady Luo in trouble?

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,240
Young Master,

90
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,280
the next time you see her,

91
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,800
you won't call her Lady Luo.

92
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,320
You'll call her Madam Xu.

93
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,720
Madam Xu?

94
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,080
She...

95
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,240
She is married?

96
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,200
No.

97
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,680
No way.

98
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,960
She is not married to an ordinary man.

99
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,120
Her husband is Xu Lingyi,
Marquis Yongping.

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,840
When did she get married?

101
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,600
After you told me

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
to investigate the case
of Lady Luo's mother,

103
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,320
I found that she

104
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,160
had married Marquis Yongping

105
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
months ago.

106
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
We didn't know until now

107
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,120
because we weren't in the capital.

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,200
You can ask

109
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,440
Master Jian of Xianling Pavilion.

110
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,200
That unexpected incident

111
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,600
about Xianling Pavilion

112
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
was related to Madam Xu.

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
Young Master. Young Master.

114
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
I haven't finished.

115
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,880
Mr. Ou.

116
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,480
Master Jian, tell me

117
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,280
if Lady Luo is the wife
of Marquis Yongping.

118
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,360
So, you've found out.

119
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,720
This is my fault.

120
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,960
I was occupied with
concealing her identity.

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,080
I should have clued you in.

122
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,360
Her Marquise title

123
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,680
would cause her inconvenience.

124
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,120
I was foolish.

125
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,840
This is not your fault.

126
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,000
I thought we were close.

127
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
But the truth is we couldn't

128
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
be further from each other.

129
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,280
I heard that Lady Luo's trouble

130
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,680
affected Xianling Pavilion.

131
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,160
No worries.

132
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,320
It's pretty much over now.

133
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,240
Some villains did wrong

134
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
and implicated

I don't want them.

171
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,880
Nothing to see there.

172
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,200
Let's go and eat Qixi snacks.

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Come on.

174
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,480
Come and have a look.

175
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,240
Have a look.

176
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,400
We need one more pair of players

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,520
for this game

178
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,840
to start.

179
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,320
Win the Heart-to-Heart Lanterns

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
and be with
the love of your life forever.

181
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,600
Sir, Madam,

182
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
are you interested in playing?

183
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,040
Come.

184
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,920
Come here.

185
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,000
Folks,

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
my pitch-pot game

187
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,520
is unique.

188
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,160
It serves as a prayer

189
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
and binds lovers together.

190
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,400
It tests your...

191
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm not good at throwing things,

192
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,080
let alone throwing things
with a blindfold over my eyes.

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,680
Just trust me

194
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,800
when you play.

195
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,160
Tacit understanding...

196
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,920
Will I win if I trust you?

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
...is required to win.

198
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

199
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,760
-Folks...
-Alright.

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,560
I'll trust you this time.

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
-We understand.
-Yeah.

202
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,440
Are you ready?

203
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,160
Yes.

204
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,520
-Yes.
-Yes.

205
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,480
Yes.

206
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
Then let us

207
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
begin.

208
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,040
Hold this.

209
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
I need you to throw the arrow out

210
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
when I count to three.

211
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,160
Wait until I count to three.

212
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,920
One. Two.

213
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
I didn't tell you to let go.

214
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,200
What's the rush?

215
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,680
I was not ready.

216
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,000
It's alright.

217
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,640
Be ready.

218
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,120
One. Two. Three.

219
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,060
Did we succeed?

220
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,960
They threw it into the pot.

221
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,960
We threw it into the pot.

222
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,720
It's alright.

223
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
This is for you.

224
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,240
Thank you.

225
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,120
This is for you.

226
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,660
(Holding Your Hands)
(Growing old with you)

227
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,640
Do you like it?

228
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Yes.

229
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,200
Do you also like the man

230
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,280
who won the lanterns for you?

231
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
I contributed too.

232
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,240
My Lord.

233
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,320
Look at that.

234
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,560
My Lord.

235
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
Let's head there.

236
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
Alive or dead, I will be with you.

237
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,640

Remember to come again.

267
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:38,960
Sure.

268
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,760
Mister, I'm here.

269
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,160
Hi, Young Lady.

270
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,960
I will have a pack

271
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
of the lucky carp snack I just ate.

272
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,000
Alright.

273
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,440
Do you think

274
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,960
this Qixi snack looks good?

275
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
-Yes.
-Yes.

276
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,400
Will Her Ladyship like it?

277
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
How about we get another pack of this?

278
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,800
Yes.

279
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll have a pack of
each of these two snacks.

280
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,520
Alright.

281
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,920
These two snacks
are this year's bestsellers.

282
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,640
Young Lady,

283
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,880
if you wish upon a lotus lantern

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,280
on the night of the Qixi Festival,

285
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,440
your wish will come true.

286
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Buy a lotus lantern.

287
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,880
Alright.

288
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,400
Here, take it.

289
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,680
Thank you.

290
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,080
Yummy.

291
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
Where is Amber?

292
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,480
She probably went to Her Ladyship.

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
-Sir.
-Young Lady, take it.

294
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,920
We should find her.

295
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,880
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

296
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
Remember to come again.

297
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,880
If we play the pitch-pot game

298
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,360
again in a few days...

299
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
He won't want us to be there.

300
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,720
-Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

301
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,840
The lantern.

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,360
Be careful.

303
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,400
It's fine.

304
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,620
(Holding Your Hands)

305
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,880
I am Luo Shiyi.

306
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,560
Thank you for saving my life.

307
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,000
You're so nice.

308
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,680
Look at that. It's so beautiful.

309
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
Mr. Ou.

310
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,000
Amber.

311
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Are you alright?

312
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,920
Forgive me for asking.

313
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Have you found out the truth?

314
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,480
It turns out my feelings

315
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,120
have always been one-sided.

316
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
I was foolish.

317
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,000
I occupied myself with wooing her.

318
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,360
I never noticed

319
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,680
she was already married.

320
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Why didn't I learn it until now?

321
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,040
I made a fool of myself.

322
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,520
Mr. Ou.

323
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,960
Her Ladyship didn't let her family know

325
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,880
she went to Xianling Pavilion.

326
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,310
I didn't tell you

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
to avoid getting her in trouble.

328
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,920
I see.

329
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,830
I'll stay away

330
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,800
from her in the future.

331
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,830
I won't cause her more trouble.

332
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,960
Mr. Ou, that's not what I mean.

333
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,480
Mr. Ou, look.

334
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,520
The lotus lantern

335
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,560
is the most effective charm
for making a wish

336
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
on the day of the Qixi Festival.

337
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,480
With the blessings of Altair and Vega,

338
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,800
you no doubt

339
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,360
will find your soulmate soon.

340
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,760
Thank you, Amber.

341
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,640
No problem.

342
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,480
I'll get going.

343
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,800
Dongqing will grow worried
if she doesn't find me.

344
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,640
This lantern is really beautiful.

345
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

346
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,760
Unfortunately,
the other one is burned down.

347
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,320
It'd be more charming if we hung

348
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,440
one lantern on each side.

349
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
I don't think you love

350
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,040
the lantern.

351
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,640
You just love the poem on the lantern.

352
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Holding Your Hands.
Growing old with you.

353
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
With whom do you wish to
spend the rest of your life?

354
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,120
His Lordship, of course.

355
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,800
Am I right?

356
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,600
I have spoiled you to the point

357
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,040
that you would talk carelessly.

358
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,480
If His Lordship heard you,

359
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,800
he would punish you.

360
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,360
If he heard me,

361
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
he wouldn't punish me,

362
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,240
but he might

363
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
reward me.

364
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,160
Your Ladyship,

365
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,240
have you started to think

366
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,840
His Lordship is a nice man?

367
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,600
At first, I decided

368
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,320
to leave this place

369
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,440
once I found the killer.

370
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,200
I never had hope in him.

371
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,040
But after I spent enough time with him,

372
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,120
I found him

373
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,960
to be an upright

374
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,400
and loyal man.

375
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
Not just that.

376
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,680
He cares so much

377
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,880
about you

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,000
and is considerate toward you.

379
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,160
And I've discovered

380
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,760
the way he looks at you

381
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,440
differs from the way he looks at others.

382
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,440
He must

383
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,800
truly love you.

384
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,200
He said

385
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,840
love is about respect, trust

386
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,080
and compromise.

387
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
He treats me

388
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
as he said.

389
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,520
But I've been harboring ulterior motives

390
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,120
since I married him.

391
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,240
I'm indebted to him.

392
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,760
Your Ladyship,

393
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,360
you may have married him

394
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,440
with an axe to grind,

395
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,680
but you've done everything right

396
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,280
since you joined his family.

397
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,280
His Lordship

398
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,920
must have noted your effort.

399
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Otherwise, he wouldn't love you so much.

400
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,280
If you really

401
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,320
feel indebted to him,

402
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,400
you can accept his love.

403
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,240
Lead a happy life

404
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,360
with him

405
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,200
after you find the killer.

406
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,440
Alive or dead, I will be with you.

407
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,560
Holding Your Hands.
Growing old with you.

408
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,880
Young Master.

409
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,440
You drank so much.

410
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,560
Your head must hurt.

411
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,440
I asked the kitchen staff

412
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,840
to make a hangover cure.

413
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,480
Young Master.

414
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,200
I don't mean to offend you.

415
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,520
But you should look at yourself.

416
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,600
Here.

417
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,240
We did a lot of traveling

418
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,280
over the years.

419
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,720
You withstood stormy waves

420
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,320
and northern winds and snows

421
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,240
with ease.

422
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,280
Now a woman makes you...

423
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,400
A man can find a wife anytime.

424
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,440
Here.

425
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,120
Here, Young Master.

426
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,120
But the gusts of wind and the huge waves

427
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,120
only hurt me on the outside,
not on the inside.

428
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
Since she is a married woman,

429
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,440
I'll get past my feelings.

430
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,520
I'll stay in the capital for now.

431
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,120
Lady Luo...

432
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,560
I need you to find
the truth about the death of

433
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,320
Madam Xu's mother as soon as possible.

434
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,600
But Young Master,

435
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,160
why would you

436
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,720
still help her investigate

437
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,080
when you know she is
Marquis Yongping's wife?

438
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,080
Marquis Yongping

439
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,600
has more resources than us.

440
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
He can find the truth

441
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,360
easily.

442
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
We don't need to bustle about

443
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,680
to help them.

444
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Besides, the Xu family
and the Ou family...

445
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,880
A gentleman cannot go back on his word.

446
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,680
I don't care who she is.

447
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,720
I gave her a promise

448
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,400
and I must fulfill it.

449
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,640
After I've done my job,

450
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,200
I'll cut ties with her.

451
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,760
I've actually discovered some clues

452
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,360
to the killer.

453
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,440
I was going to tell you yesterday.

454
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,960
But you rushed to Xianling Pavilion

455
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,680
before I could even finish.

456
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
What have you discovered?

457
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,460
(Rites)

458
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,800
These snacks are delicious.

459
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,680
I saved some

460
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,600
for you.

461
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,480
Thank you for thinking of us.

462
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
You're so nice.

463
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,520
You'll find an ideal husband

464
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,360
for certain.

465
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,440
Come off it.

466
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,400
I was nice enough

467
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,320
to buy you food.

468
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,320
But you mocked me.

469
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,840
You must be looking forward

470
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,720
to punishment from me.

471
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,040
You're always

472
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,600
so tactless.

473
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,840
Only because you come and go

474
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,600
like a shadow.

475
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,120
Don't talk back.

476
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,920
The same old reply.

477
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,560
What brought you here?

478
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,720
Is His Lordship here?

479
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,960
I have important affairs
to discuss with him.

480
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,000
He just returned to Banyuepan.

481
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,600
I know your work kept you

482
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,560
from participating in the lantern fair

483
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,520
at the Qixi Festival,

484
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,400
but you must try

485
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,840
this Qixi snack.

486
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,720
I don't see anything

487
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,840
special about this snack.

488
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,360
You should know

489
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,800
the Qixi snack
brings lovers together.

490
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,520
I heard from His Lordship

491
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,640
that you are

492
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,160
not young

493
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,600
and you never

494
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,960
have a suitable marriage option.

495
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,720
You have difficulty finding a match.

496
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,280
Maybe a matchmaker

497
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,200
will visit you to propose marriage

498
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,520
soon after you eat the Qixi snack.

499
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,200
Are you mocking me?

500
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,400
No, I wouldn't dare.

501
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,160
I'm helping

502
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,760
relieve your worries.

503
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,520
It seems you're pretty eager

504
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,600
to find a match.

505
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,680
I think you are the eager one.

506
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,720
What does it have to do with me?

507
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,960
The Qixi snack

508
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,560
does bring lovers together.

509
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,560
But in most cases,

510
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,520
women make snacks and give them

511
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,960
to the men they like.

512
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,880
You gave me snacks

513
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,320
and talked to me about marriage.

514
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,160
Does it mean you like me?

515
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,120
Nonsense.

516
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't like you.

517
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,320
I'm sure you won't have any chance

518
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
at marriage this year as well.

519
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,200
Mr. Ou learned

520
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,760
you are the wife of Marquis Yongping

521
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,560
and came to me for verification.

522
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,160
He seemed to have difficulty

523
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,360
accepting the truth.

524
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,360
He treated me as a friend.

525
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,000
But I concealed my identity

526
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,920
to avoid trouble.

527
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,760
I was unfair to him.

528
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,840
He told me to call you here

529
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,720
because he had something to tell you.

530
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,760
Master Jian.

531
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
You're here.

532
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,840
Madam Xu, sorry that I kept you waiting.

533
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Mr. Ou,

534
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
I just arrived.

535
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,080
I concealed my identity

536
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,840
from you

537
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,480
for my own convenience.

538
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,320
I hereby apologize to you.

539
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,840
Please forgive me.

540
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,920
It's alright.

541
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,280
Your identity as Marquis Yongping's wife

542
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,200
would cause you trouble.

543
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,800
I understand.

544
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,320
I won't blame you.

545
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,800
Let's not stand.

546
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,840
Take a seat.

547
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,960
By the way,

548
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,400
why did you want me here?

549
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,000
I almost forgot the important business.

550
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
I promised to help you

551
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,920
investigate

552
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,080
the killer of your mother.

553
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,960
This is the coroner

554
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,920
who examined your mother's corpse.

555
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,400
Lv Qingtong was stabbed to death

556
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,480
by a pirate near Ci'an Temple

557
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,640
and I examined her body

558
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,120
for injuries.

559
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,440
Is there any problem?

560
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,600
I remember one of her wounds

561
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,560
was caused by a blade.

562
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,360
But the heart wound that took her life

563
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,440
was caused by an arrow.

564
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,000
Caused by an arrow?

565
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,760
Yes.

566
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
How could it be?

567
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,840
I recall
the Shuntian Prefecture Office's

568
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,440
autopsy document indicated

569
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
that the fatal wound
was caused by a blade.

570
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,120
And the wound in my mother's chest

571
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,360
was indeed caused by a blade.

572
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,000
Yes, the wounds in her chest and back

573
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,320
were caused by a blade.

574
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,960
But those wounds

575
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,400
covered the wound

576
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,000
that slashed through her heart and lung,

577
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,400
which was obviously caused by an arrow.

578
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,000
If the fatal wound was
caused by an arrow,

579
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,480
what's with the wounds
caused by a blade?

580
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,920
Perhaps the killer

581
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,680
did this to conceal the truth

582
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,960
about her death.

583
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,640
The killer shot her with an arrow

584
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,000
before cutting her with a blade.

585
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,640
The people sent by my superior

586
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
took the case over from me

587
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,560
before I could

588
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,880
record my discovery.

589
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
I had doubts,

590
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,720
but I lost the right to handle the case.

591
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,000
Covering the fatal wound.

592
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,960
Replacing the coroner halfway
through the investigation.

593
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,200
Tampering with the autopsy document.

594
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,560
These things were done
to conceal the truth.

595
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,240
I'm afraid the culprit

596
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,160
is of extraordinary status.

597
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,200
Your Ladyship,

598
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,560
that coroner said

599
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,200
the killer lingered

600
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,800
around Ci'an Temple.

601
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,520
Who could have

602
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,960
bought off the government officials

603
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,440
and concealed the truth?

604
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,760
That coroner presented
no evidence to support his words.

605
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,720
There's no way to know

606
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
if he spoke the truth.

607
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,480
Then what are we

608
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
doing here?

609
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,520
We've investigated

610
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,720
every place we should.

611
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,600
Besides, it's been a long time.

612
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,040
Even if there had been clues,

613
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,360
we've come here too late.

614
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Dongqing,

615
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,120
do you remember

616
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,040
the other incident

617
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,040
that took place that day?

618
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
His Lordship caught a pirate

619
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,040
on the back hill.

620
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,560
But what does it

621
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,680
have to do with your mother?

622
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,800
Folks,

623
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,960
it's getting late.

624
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
Wild beasts often come here.

625
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,600
You'd better go home.

626
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,400
Sir.

627
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,920
How can I help you?

628
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,680
Do you

629
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
often hunt here?

630
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,760
I live down the mountain.

631
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,520
I've been hunting here

632
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,920
for over ten years.

633
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,040
Do you remember

634
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,960
that a woman

635
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
was murdered here

636
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,160
two years ago?

637
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,360
It did happen.

638
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,680
I recall a lot of officers

639
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,080
coming here that day.

640
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,280
They startled me.

641
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,040
I think

642
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,600
they came to annihilate a fugitive.

643
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,360
Yes. That's the thing I'm talking about.

644
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,720
Do you remember

645
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,240
what happened that day?

646
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,440
That fugitive

647
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
held a woman hostage

648
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,880
at this place that day.

649
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,160
Are you referring

650
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,440
to that woman?

651
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,800
Do you remember

652
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,520
what she looked like?

653
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,680
I was far from them.

654
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,680
I didn't see her clearly.

655
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,160
But when she

656
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,040
was calling for the officers' help,

657
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,720
I vaguely heard

658
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,480
her say something

659
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,360
about being a concubine.

660
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
What...

661
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,160
What happened then?

662
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,160
A large group of people
reached stalemate.

663
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,480
Nobody dared to move.

664
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,680
The high-ranking official
who led the officers

665
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,880
shot the woman dead

666
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,240
with an arrow.

667
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,520
Then the fugitive

668
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,960
ran that way.

669
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,080
Are you alright, Madam?

670
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,560
Did you speak

671
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,720
the truth?

672
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,960
Absolutely.

673
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,760
I saw it.

674
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,320
I hid there that day.

675
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
I was so scared
that I could barely breathe.

676
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,480
The only reason I'm telling you

677
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,840
is the whole incident
happened a long time ago.

678
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,240
Sir.

679
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,880
May I see that arrow of yours?

680
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,720
Go ahead.

681
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,400
Take it.

682
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,920
This arrow

683
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,200
looks different

684
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,120
from the other arrows I saw.

685
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,440
This is a three-edged arrow.

686
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,440
It comes with a barb and a fuller.

687
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,120
It's slightly larger

688
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,480
than average arrows.

689
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,880
Only the Xu family
has this kind of arrow.

690
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,080
How did you get this arrow?

691
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,800
I found it that day.

692
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,560
It has helped me bring down

693
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,670
quite a few of my quarries.

694
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,080
Is there any problem with my arrow?

695
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,440
You can go.

696
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,480
But my arrow...

697
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,120
Go.

698
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,190
You should leave.
Beasts really come here.

699
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,800
Your Ladyship.

700
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,280
This is His Lordship's arrow.

701
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,800
I don't believe it.

702
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,710
I don't believe His Lordship

703
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,520
is capable of such cruelty.

704
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,630
No.

705
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,920
It couldn't be him.

706
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
No way.

707
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,710
No.

708
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I don't believe it either.

709
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,960
No.

710
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,520
His Lordship would never

711
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,680
kill innocent people.

712
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,600
Wan Daxian.

713
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,200
Investigate that hunter.

714
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,200
Yes, Your Ladyship.

715
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,040
Your Ladyship.

716
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,780
(Mansion of Xu)

717
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,360
Your Ladyship.

718
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,440
His Lordship is here.

719
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,080
He is waiting for you inside.

720
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
Put this thing away.

721
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,480
Yes.

722
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,620
(Birth mother Lv's tablet)

723
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,640
You came home so late.

724
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,040
My Lord.

725
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,280
I came home late

726
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,760
because I had things to do
at Xianling Pavilion.

727
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,200
I have something to give you.

728
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,320
Come with me.

729
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,200
My Lord, this lantern...

730
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,520
I saw only one lantern

731
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,400
hanging on the door

732
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,120
and felt that something was missing.

733
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
So I made

734
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,960
an exact copy of this lantern.

735
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,720
You made it?

736
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,520
I always had so much work

737
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,240
to do under the light of the lanterns.

738
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,040
I never realized that the lanterns

739
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,280
could create such a warm atmosphere

740
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,720
that made me want to relax all the time.

741
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,200
With someone by my side

742
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,000
and a few children to raise.

743
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,880
I delight in the trifles
of everyday life

744
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,400
and high culture alike.

745
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,280
But you can have

746
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,480
an ordinary and simple life anytime.

747
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,720
What's so good about it?

748
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,080
You give

749
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,120
everything in this world

750
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,040
a different meaning.

751
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,280
(The high-ranking official
who led the officers)

752
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,760
(shot the woman dead)

753
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
(with an arrow.)

754
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,040
My Lord.

755
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm feeling under the weather.

756
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,680
I'll get inside and rest.

757
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,720
I'm sure

758
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,440
you've heard about it.

759
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,760
An earthquake hit Shandong last month.

760
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,200
The refugees streaming into the capital

761
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,600
started a rumor
that the local government

762
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,840
failed to provide
adequate disaster relief

763
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,240
and disturbed the local people.

764
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,320
Bandits became rampant.

765
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,640
The imperial court still hasn't received

766
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,880
a report from the Shandong government.

767
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,360
Now we need someone to visit
Shandong with the officials

768
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,120
of the Ministry of Revenue
and inspect the post-disaster situation.

769
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,520
Is any one of you willing to go?

770
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,800
Grand Secretary,

771
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,080
I'm willing to go.

772
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,360
Ever since I learned of the disaster,

773
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,120
I've been concerned about it.

774
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,360
I'm willing to go to Shandong.

775
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,200
Official Ou, you truly care

776
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,800
about the victims of the disaster

777
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,240
and the righteous cause.

778
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,960
Surely, you'll do your best

779
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
to help with disaster relief.

780
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,960
Grand Secretary,

781
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,840
the earthquake was strong.

782
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,240
The journey will be long.

783
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,880
I think

784
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,480
only the person who can move

785
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,200
at the pace of an infantry unit

786
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,480
qualifies for the role of the inspector.

787
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,400
We'll need you

788
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
to take up the task, Marquis Yongping.

789
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,080
This matter is urgent.

790
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,600
You must set off as soon as possible.

791
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,200
Understood.

792
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,080
Your Ladyship,

793
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,480
don't worry.

794
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Maybe there's something

795
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,040
wrong with the hunter.

796
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,360
Yu.

797
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,480
Yu, slow down.

798
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,480
I'm sorry, Mother.

799
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,520
I got careless.

800
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,040
Let me wipe it clean.

801
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,640
Stand up.

802
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,240
It's not a big deal.

803
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,120
Look at you.
Your face is covered in sweat.

804
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,920
Wipe it away

805
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,440
or you might catch a cold.

806
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,640
What's the matter, Mother?

807
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,480
Who gave you this handkerchief?

808
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,480
Concubine Wen gave it to me.

809
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,480
Your Ladyship,

810
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
Yu's handkerchiefs as well as clothes

811
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,480
are prepared by Concubine Wen.

812
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,080
Yu,

813
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,000
can you lend me

814
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,160
this handkerchief?

815
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,600
Sure.

816
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,080
Thank you.

817
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,680
Go have fun.

818
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,760
Come on.

819
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,440
Your Ladyship,

820
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,920
Wan Daxian is back.

821
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,480
Your Ladyship,

822
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,360
I've checked the hunter's background.

823
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,440
He lives

824
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,480
near Ci'an Temple.

825
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,720
He and his family have a clean record.

826
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,080
There's nothing suspicious about him.

827
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,960
Your Ladyship,

828
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,560
these two embroidery patterns

829
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,840
are exactly the same.

830
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,200
And that arrow

831
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,320
is His Lordship's three-edged arrow.

832
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Did His Lordship

833
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,960
really kill Concubine Lv?

834
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,400
I still don't believe it.

835
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,960
I rarely see you drink alcohol.

836
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,280
Why are you

837
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,280
in the mood to drink today?

838
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,800
Is there any good news?

839
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,080
You made a lantern for me.

840
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,400
I haven't thanked you yet.

841
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,080
It's just a lantern.

842
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,920
Has it really pleased you so much?

843
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,520
I'm very grateful to you.

844
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,040
Let me drink a toast to you.

845
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,280
We are married.
You don't have to be formal around me.

846
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,960
If you like it,

847
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,920
I'll make a few more lanterns for you.

848
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,240
You've been going out early
and coming home late these days.

849
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,920
Drink more

850
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,040
to refresh yourself.

851
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,440
Alright.

852
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,760
Drink with me.

853
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,020
(Rites)

854
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,520
Good wine.

855
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,560
My Lord,

856
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,240
you're drunk.

857
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,560
No.

858
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,320
I'm not drunk.

859
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,680
My Lord,

860
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,680
I have a question.

861
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,120
On the day of our first meeting,

862
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,800
I was held hostage by the villain

863
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,680
and my life was threatened.

864
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,720
Nobody dared to take action.

865
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,320
Only you

866
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,560
released an arrow decisively.

867
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,440
If something like that

868
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,320
happened now,

869
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,960
would you still release an arrow?

870
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,480
Yes.

871
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,080
Isn't the hostage's life

872
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,240
important?

873
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,920
It is.

874
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,000
But capturing the villains
is also important.

875
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,640
I couldn't let them run away.

876
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,840
What about my mother?

877
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,520
How did my mother die?

878
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,440
It was my fault.

879
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,280
It was my fault.

880
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:07,500
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

881
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,920
Your Ladyship.

882
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,260
(Growing old with you)

883
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,880
(It was my fault.)

884
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,960
(It was my fault.)

885
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,760
Dongqing.

886
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,640
Take down

887
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,640
these two lanterns.

888
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,000
Yes.
