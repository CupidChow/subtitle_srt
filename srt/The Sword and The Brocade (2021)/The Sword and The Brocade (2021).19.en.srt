(How did I fall asleep?)

20
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,200
No, I won't.

22
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,000
In a while,

23
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,480
I will have to go
pay respects to mother.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
It is not proper for me to arrive late.

25
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Your silver hairpin

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,760
is too plain.

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,960
I used to have a jade hairpin

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,120
which I liked very much.

29
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
But I lost it.

30
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,240
So I just picked a silver hairpin
for use randomly.

31
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,760
My Lord, won't you get up?

32
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
I want to sleep a little longer.

33
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,720
Concubine Qin and Concubine Qiao

34
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,120
have come into contact with Fengqing.

35
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Who are you planning to entrust

36
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,160
to raise Fengqing?

37
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,640
I can't hand over Fengqing
to Concubine Qiao.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
She only cares about herself.

39
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,520
So she can't take good care of children.

40
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,000
How about Concubine Qin?

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
Concubine Qin

42
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,280
cares about Fengqing heartily.

43
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
But

44
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
Fengqing was born outside our mansion.

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Up to date,
he hasn't started his studies.

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
And Concubine Qin was a maid
before becoming a concubine

47
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
and isn't learned.

48
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,480
I am afraid that
she can't teach Fengqing well.

49
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,560
In fact, I think that

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,400
Yizhen is really fond of Fengqing

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
and cares about him sincerely.

52
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Moreover, she is alone.

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,640
Why don't you consider

54
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,640
allowing Yizhen to raise Fengqing,
My Lord?

55
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
When Yu was born,

56
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,680
Yizhen lost

57
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,720
her own child.

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,960
Mother feared that she might be too sad.

59
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,680
So back then, Mother planned to

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,840
make Yu her adopted son.

61
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
But she refused.

62
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,720
Why?

63
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,480
Because she thought that

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,960
she was responsible for Qian's death

65
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,080
No wonder.

66
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,920
You've made progress.

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,440
If there is nothing else
I can do for you,

68
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,600
I will be off.

69
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:37,920
OK.

70
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,720
Madam, the clothes
you made are so nice.

71
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,840
When Fengqing sees them,

72
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,040
he will surely like them.

73
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Now

74
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,080
it is absolutely impossible
for Concubine Qiao

75
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,520
to raise Fengqing.

76
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,280
You are the only one

77
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
who can assume
this major responsibility.

78
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,800
Feicui,

79
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,760
hurry to get the gifts ready.

80
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,200
Then put some toys liked by children

81
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
in this room.

82
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,680
This room

83
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,600
looks too dull.

84
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
We must make it lively.

85
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,840
Yes, Madam.

86
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,200
I'll be working on it right now.

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,040
Fengqing,

88
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,560
look at the bamboos.
Aren't they beautiful?

89
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Come. Let's go have a look.

90
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Second Madam.

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,880
Fengqing, what are you looking at?

92
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,080
What is so special about these bamboos

93
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,520
that they attract you so much?

94
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,760
Second Madam.

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
For unknown reasons, Fengqing

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
just likes coming here
to appreciate these bamboos.

97
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,120
Fengqing.

98
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
Fengqing.

99
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,660
(The Painting of Xu Ling'an)

100
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,910
Madam.

101
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,520
Fengqing is similar to Master Ling'an

102
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,160
in their liking for bamboo.

103
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
Besides,

104
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
as I see it,

105
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
you hit it off with Fengqing.

106
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,760
Why don't you make Fengqing...

107
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,600
Xiaxiang.

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
You shall not say this

109
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
again from now on.

110
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,880
Lingyi.

111
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,480
Why do you want to see me?

112
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
Marquis Dingnan has come to know it.

113
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
What?

114
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,240
How come my father-in-law
has learned of it?

115
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,520
They have sent Yuemei and her brother

116
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,040
to Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

117
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,920
I suspect that

118
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,560
sending Fengqing here

119
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,400
is also the arrangement
of the Ou family.

120
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,280
Lingyi, what should I do then?

121
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,840
We are at fault
in this matter in the first place.

122
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
The only thing we can do now is that

123
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
you go explain it in person

124
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,600
and repent your error sincerely.

125
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Only in this way, you may
be forgiven by Marquis Dingnan.

126
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,320
No. No. No.

127
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Lingyi, you know

128
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,080
the temper of my father-in-law.

129
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,160
If I really go see him,

130
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,960
he will definitely kill me.

131
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
Since you know the consequence,
why did you do it back then?

132
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,000
This time,

133
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,640
you have to face the music yourself.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,000
Lingyi,

135
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,040
are you trying to get me killed?

136
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,840
If you dare not face the music,

137
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
you don't deserve
to be a man of our Xu family.

138
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
Moreover,

139
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,440
now the situation is severe.

140
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,840
How could I allow you

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,680
to take shelter at home

142
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,640
and let Marquis Dingnan

143
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,960
lash out at our Xu family as he likes?

144
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
You should have the big picture
on your mind.

145
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,200
How can you be so thoughtless?

146
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,840
This is my own business.

147
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,040
You need not bother about it.

148
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Xu Lingkuan, come back.

149
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,680
You take some men to watch him.

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,120
Before he admits his fault,

151
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,160
he should not be allowed to go anywhere.

152
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Yes, My Lord.

153
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,560
My Lord.

154
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,520
This is the plum wine
freshly brewed by the kitchen.

155
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,760
I especially brought it here
to let you taste it.

156
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,720
Have a try.

157
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,080
I heard that you

158
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,240
grounded Lingkuan.

159
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,080
Has anything serious happened?

160
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,680
Marquis Dingnan has come to know that

161
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,400
Fengqing is Lingkuan's son.

162
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,400
I asked Lingkuan to go apologize
to Marquis Dingnan.

163
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,880
But he is timid

164
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,640
and so spineless.

165
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
In the coming days,
how could I feel assured

166
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
to let him handle any affair?

167
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
Though Lingkuan is not like you

168
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
who is both brainy and brawny,

169
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
he shows filial piety to his mother
and respects his brothers,

170
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,040
cares for his wife

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
and is nice to the servants.

172
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
He has many merits.

173
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,640
Lingkuan is kind in nature.

174
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,640
Though he has an element of the playboy,

175
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,440
he still bears
the cardinal principles in mind.

176
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
In childhood,

177
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,000
he always followed me around.

178
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,200
When he got into trouble
and worried Mother might punish him,

179
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,880
he would turn to me for help.

180
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
I didn't know there is such a past

181
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
between you and Lingkuan.

182
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
Speaking in this sense,

183
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,840
you two must be

184
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,240
on intimate terms.

185
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
I always think that

186
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,600
I know him very well.

187
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
But unknowingly,

188
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,880
we became so estranged from each other.

189
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
Now I am totally unaware of

190
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
what he is thinking.

191
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,800
How come he has caused
such a great trouble?

192
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,920
My Lord, if you want to know the reason,

193
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,080
you can go ask Lingkuan.

194
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,640
I am afraid that even if I ask him,

195
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,440
he won't come clean with me.

196
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,200
If you pull a long face

197
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,400
as you are doing now

198
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,920
and looks like you are
going to lecture people,

199
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,680
anybody will feel scared seeing you.

200
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,520
If I was Lingkuan,

201
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,560
I would not confess to you, either.

202
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,120
Though

203
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,840
you two are not
as close as you used to be,

204
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,200
you can try talking with

205
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,360
Lingkuan

206
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,280
in a calm mood.

207
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,680
Lingkuan.

208
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,600
Come on.

209
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,240
Lingkuan.

210
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,520
These are all your
favorite dishes in normal days.

211
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,160
Eat some, no matter what.

212
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,160
I will eat them in a while.

213
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,280
You are lying to me again.

214
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
You said this previously.

215
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,360
But after I listened to you and left,

216
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
you ate nothing.

217
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,320
You are wasting away these days.

218
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,000
Whatever I asked you about,
you didn't answer.

219
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,760
This really worries me.

220
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,720
Don't worry about me.

221
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
Now you are in the family way.

222
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,040
So you can't worry too much.

223
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
It's all my fault.

224
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
I have done something wrong

225
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,640
to displease Lingyi

226
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,800
and disrupt the peace of our family.

227
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
Things will become all right soon.

228
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,840
By then,
I will perform the opera for you.

229
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,840
Madam, Zhaoying is here.

230
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,440
Master Lingkuan,

231
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,240
His Lordship asked you
to see him in Banyuepan.

232
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,600
Why, why did he suddenly

233
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
ask me to go to Banyuepan?

234
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,160
What is the matter?

235
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,720
Hasn't His Lordship
scolded Lingkuan enough?

236
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,400
Now he wants Lingkuan
to go to Banyuepan

237
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
so that he can continue
rebuking Lingkuan.

238
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,520
Well, about his intention,

239
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
I have no idea at all.

240
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Come, sit down.

241
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,120
It's all right.

242
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
At the worst, I will let Lingyi
work off his anger again.

243
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,840
You can't get angry again.

244
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,560
I will be back soon.

245
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,720
As soon as I am back,
I will have the meal.

246
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,520
Lingkuan.

247
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,920
I propose a toast to you first.

248
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,280
Lingyi,

249
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,720
if you have anything to say,
just fire away.

250
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,880
When you act like this,

251
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,720
I feel uneasy.

252
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,800
On that summer night,

253
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,840
you climbed up the tallest tree

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
in the eastern woods
to catch the nightingale.

255
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
You not only frightened
the birds across the woods,

256
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,600
but also almost fell off the tree.

257
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
You slid clinging to the trunk
of the tree for quite long

258
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,920
and got this scar.

259
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,040
This happened many years ago.

260
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
How come you still remember it?

261
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,200
This happened only
because I said randomly

262
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
that in the eastern woods,

263
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,520
the nightingale sang beautifully.

264
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,480
You wanted to catch one for me.

265
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,920
You got hurt because of me.

266
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,800
How could I forget?

267
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,040
Back then,

268
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,440
I liked to follow you around the most.

269
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
When I got into trouble,

270
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,920
I turned to you at the earliest time.

271
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I didn't want to go over my lessons,

272
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,320
so I acted shamelessly and made a scene.

273
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
Usually, it was you

274
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,680
who pulled my ear
and forced me to recite my lessons.

275
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,920
Since my childhood,

276
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,520
I have been
getting into troubles constantly

277
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,720
and have been causing you troubles.

278
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,800
I never blamed you for that.

279
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,680
About today's matter,

280
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,480
I was too anxious.

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,960
I always want you

282
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,600
to grow mature as early as possible

283
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,240
and want you to
assume your responsibility

284
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
as soon as possible.

285
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,520
That's why I have
lost my temper in front of you.

286
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,720
Lingyi, stop saying that.

287
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,440
It's all my fault.

288
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,040
Shiyi was right.

289
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,920
In the past days,

290
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,880
I have been too strict with you.

291
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
I have never talked with you

292
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,070
like I am doing now.

293
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,720
I have never cared about

294
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
what you thought.

295
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,350
Since our father
and elder brothers passed away,

296
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,880
I have always been on my nerves.

297
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,080
I don't want our Xu family

298
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,280
to experience the past crisis again.

299
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
So I have been trying my best
to do everything

300
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,640
that I am capable of.

301
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,040
I have been strict with myself.

302
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,920
Unconsciously,

303
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,840
I imposed this requirement

304
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,360
on you.

305
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,720
Lingyi,

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
you did that hoping that
I could become a better person.

307
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,560
I totally understand.

308
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
But I forgot that

309
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,480
you have your own thoughts

310
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,680
and your own characters.

311
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,440
I shouldn't have imposed the practice

312
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,240
that I think can protect our Xu family

313
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,800
on you.

314
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,800
Lingyi, you didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,320
It's all my fault.

316
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,080
I am good-for-nothing.

317
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,000
I have done so many absurd things

318
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,800
and brought disgrace to our Xu family.

319
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,480
Since I did the wrong thing,

320
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,600
I will face the music.

321
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
Lingyi, set your mind at rest.

322
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,240
I will definitely go apologize
to my father-in-law.

323
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,100
(Xianling Pavilion)

324
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,000
Shiyi.

325
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
It has been a long time
since you came here.

326
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,680
I have been busy with family affairs

327
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,840
and have been dealing with
the complex relations.

328
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
Only Xianling Pavilion

329
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,600
enables me to

330
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,240
enjoy some peace and tranquility.

331
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
How are you doing?

332
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,200
It has been quite long

333
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,600
since you married into the Xu family.

334
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,560
Is there

335
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,680
any special person or thing

336
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,040
that you concern yourself with?

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Except looking for clues to the killer,

338
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,000
I only attach more attention to

339
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
those kids.

340
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,520
There is nothing else

341
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,920
that I care much about.

342
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,280
Lady Luo is inside.

343
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,040
OK.

344
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,880
Mr. Lin.

345
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,440
Amber.

346
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,840
Did you come here

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
with Lady Luo today?

348
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,640
How has she been doing lately?

349
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,880
I don't have an ulterior motive.

350
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,680
I just want to know

351
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,920
how Lady Luo has been doing lately

352
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,240
and whether everything
has been going well with her.

353
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,520
She has been doing very well.

354
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,760
Glad to hear that.

355
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
This is the hand cream

356
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I especially brought back
from the south.

357
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
It works the best

358
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,040
in protecting the hand skin.

359
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,440
I want you to have this.

360
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,840
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

361
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,280
Lady Luo is inside.

362
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,000
Mr. Lin.

363
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,760
Master Jian.

364
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,240
-Mr. Lin.
-Lady Luo.

365
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,240
Well.

366
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,440
Master Jian.

367
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,040
Hands matter the most
for the embroidery girls.

368
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
They need to be taken good care of
in ordinary days.

369
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
This kind of hand cream
suits them the best.

370
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,280
You are so thoughtful, Mr. Lin.

371
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,680
We can't accept it
without doing you any service.

372
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,280
How could we

373
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,640
accept such expensive gifts from you?

374
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,400
Master Jian.

375
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,720
Don't think too much of this.

376
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,040
They are not so expensive.

377
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Please accept them.

378
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,920
OK.

379
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,600
Thank you very much, Mr. Lin.

380
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,360
Lady Luo, this is for you.

381
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,840
Please remember to use it every day.

382
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,360
Take it, please.

383
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,440
I thank you for it, Mr. Lin.

384
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,160
You are so kind to have bought us
such expensive gifts, Mr. Lin.

385
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,360
I didn't expect that

386
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,400
Your Ladyship and Mr. Lin

387
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,760
are old acquaintances.

388
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,560
In the disaster relief last time,

389
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,480
he helped us out of the predicament.

390
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,440
Though I don't have
much contact with him,

391
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,400
Mr. Lin strikes me as

392
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,760
a warm-hearted person.

393
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,360
But I don't feel good

394
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,800
owing him a favor.

395
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
If Mr. Lin comes across
any difficulty some other day,

396
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,560
we must give him a hand.

397
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,640
Yes.

398
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,200
You are right, Your Ladyship.

399
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,360
His Lordship and Lingkuan
have made up with each other.

400
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,760
They are on good terms now as brothers.

401
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,920
Lingkuan has also taken heart from it.

402
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,040
I finally can stop worrying

403
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,880
and feel relieved.

404
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,240
Madam, you should focus on
the baby you are carrying

405
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,040
and stop bothering about

406
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,360
the two brothers.

407
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,800
But there is always one thing that

408
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,720
I can't figure out.

409
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,040
That is what is the exact reason

410
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,400
for them to fall out previously

411
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,520
and for His Lordship to have got so angry.

412
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,160
I just got a feeling that

413
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,640
there must be something behind this.

414
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,120
Fifth Madam.

415
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,920
It is so rare for me

416
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,760
to run into you in the back garden.

417
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,360
It seems that you are in a good mood.

418
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,800
This garden is too small.

419
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,760
I can't enjoy some peace

420
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
even when I am out for a walk here.

421
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,720
This really spoiled my good mood.

422
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,400
Mrs. Shi, let's go back.

423
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,400
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

424
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,160
These days,

425
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,000
I have been worrying about you.

426
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,920
I guess you are still unaware of

427
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
the rumors spreading out there.

428
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,080
What rumors?

429
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,800
You haven't seen

430
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,280
Fengqing.

431
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,480
What do you mean by saying this?

432
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,200
It doesn't concern you

433
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,720
whether I have met Fengqing or not.

434
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
There is something you don't know.

435
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,840
Fengqing has

436
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,520
a pair of eyes

437
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,280
that is identical to

438
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
those of your husband.

439
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,880
Those who don't know
the inside story will think that

440
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,720
Fengqing is his son.

441
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,080
If you have anything to say,

442
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
say it directly.

443
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,360
I have said it

444
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,240
very clearly.

445
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,160
You just don't believe it.

446
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,800
If you still find it unbelievable,

447
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,640
you can go to the Western Lateral Court

448
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,600
to look at the kid.

449
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,120
Then you will understand everything.

450
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,520
Could this matter be the reason

451
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,480
why...

452
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,680
why His Lordship and Lingkuan...

453
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,640
Think about it carefully.

454
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Based on the personality
of His Lordship,

455
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
how could he

456
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,800
do such an indecent and frivolous thing.

457
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,200
Madam.

458
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,480
Fifth Madam, mind your steps.

459
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,920
Madam, don't be anxious.

460
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,760
Concubine Qiao's words
are not trustworthy.

461
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,040
Now you are carrying a baby.

462
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
You must take care.

463
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,200
How could I not be anxious?

464
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
I am wondering why Shiyi

465
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,560
can remain silent

466
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,960
and be tolerant of this love child.

467
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,920
It is because she has
become aware of the truth.

468
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,760
I will go to seek the truth from her.

469
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,280
Madam, mind your steps.

470
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,400
Madam.

471
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,160
Your mother said
in the letter to you that

472
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,880
Fengqing

473
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,480
is Master Lingkuan's love child.

474
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,520
Is it a rumor or not?

475
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,480
I have been suspicious
about this for quite a while.

476
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,240
Since His Lordship is not
a philandering man,

477
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,760
it is impossible for him
to have a love child.

478
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
It is very possible that
what my mother said is true.

479
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,600
But you have told this

480
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,200
to Princess Danyang.

481
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,640
What can you get from it?

482
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,200
I am sure Princess Danyang

483
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,760
won't thank you for that.

484
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,560
Madam, watch out for the steps.

485
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,080
What's wrong?

486
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,240
There are cracks on the steps.

487
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
Her Ladyship has asked
servants to repair them.

488
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,120
The weather is damp,

489
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,720
I'm afraid it'll take days

490
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,960
for the concrete to dry.

491
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,720
That's why I gave you a heads-up,

492
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,920
in case you'll slip.

493
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,560
Her Ladyship just
ordered servants to renovate

494
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
the steps of the Western Lateral Court.

495
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,600
Danyang is in the family way.

496
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,120
It rained previously.

497
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,960
If Danyang comes across
something bad on impulse,

498
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,040
I am afraid that Luo Shiyi

499
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,480
won't be able to enjoy
any peace in the coming days.

500
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,320
You didn't catch it.

501
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,280
Give it to me. Give it to me.

502
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,360
Madam, take care.

503
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,360
Is he Fengqing?

504
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
Fifth Madam, what are you doing?

505
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
Mrs. Shi,

506
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,240
who do you think he looks like?

507
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,200
Madam, calm down please.

508
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,480
Fengqing.

509
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:22,960
Don't run away.

510
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,800
-Fengqing.
-Madam.

511
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,440
-Fengqing.
-Fengqing.

512
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
-Fengqing.
-Stop running.

513
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,880
Madam.

514
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,880
-Madam.
-Your Ladyship.

515
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,040
Your Ladyship.

516
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,120
Are you all right?

517
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,760
Madam.

518
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,040
How are you? Are you all right?

519
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,520
I am fine.

520
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,200
Mr. Xu.

521
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,800
The rain is getting heavier.

522
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,760
It is impossible for
His Lordship to see you.

523
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,160
Please go back.

524
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,880
If I can't see my father-in-law,

525
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,240
I won't leave.

526
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,620
(Upright and Spotless Nobility)

527
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,000
I have let you down.

528
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,520
I haven't taken good care of Danyang.

529
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,400
I am here to apologize to you.

530
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,160
Oh, my.

531
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,600
I have disappointed Danyang.

532
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,880
I came to your mansion today

533
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,360
to apologize to you.

534
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,000
You should apologize to Danyang

535
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,560
instead of me.

536
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,600
It's all my fault.

537
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,360
Danyang is carrying a baby.

538
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,400
I dare not tell her this.

539
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,880
I fear that she can't stand this.

540
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,560
Such being the case,

541
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
I have nothing to say to you.

542
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,480
I will go bring Danyang back

543
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,720
to my mansion tomorrow.

544
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,040
Father-in-law.

545
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,360
Father-in-law.

546
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,000
Danyang is carrying my baby.

547
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
How could I cut ties with her?

548
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,920
She is my wife

549
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,200
and she will be for all my life.

550
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,160
Father-in-law.

551
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,040
It's my fault to have done such a thing.

552
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,240
I still remember that

553
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,840
when you entrusted me with Danyang,

554
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,040
you told me that

555
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,520
Danyang lost her mother as a child

556
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
and exhorted me to take good care of her

557
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,440
not letting her feel a bit aggrieved.

558
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,720
I still remember these words you said.

559
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,360
I still remember them.

560
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,000
Then why did you hanker after
other women outside

561
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,800
and get yourself a love child?

562
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,600
I really didn't know it.

563
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,920
I have broken off my relations

564
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,520
with Yuemei

565
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,880
before I married Danyang.

566
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
If she hadn't come to see me this time,

567
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,240
I wouldn't have known that

568
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,680
she bore me a baby.

569
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,520
If I had known it,

570
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,080
I would never have
hidden it from Danyang.

571
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,040
Even if she wanted to break off
our engagement, I would tell her.

572
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,920
It's no use for you to regret now.

573
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,800
You tell me how this matter
should be handled.

574
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,360
I have consulted with Lingyi.

575
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,960
I decided to entrust the kid
to the care of him.

576
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,600
We will tell others that

577
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,400
the kid is his son.

578
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,400
I will hide it from Danyang
for the time being.

579
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,760
We will see what to do
after Danyang gives birth.

580
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,400
You want to deceive your superiors
and subordinates.

581
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,480
You are really something.

582
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,400
After Danyang gives birth to the child

583
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,640
and her body recovers
from the childbirth,

584
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,080
I will come clean with her

585
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,480
and will accept whatever result.

586
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,200
Father-in-law,

587
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,920
Danyang loves me dearly

588
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,600
and I also love her genuinely.

589
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,240
If she feels sad,

590
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,840
I will feel sadder than her.

591
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,680
From now on,

592
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,040
I will be faithful to Danyang

593
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,960
and will never get her hurt a bit.

594
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,520
Please trust me once more.

595
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,400
What's done is done.

596
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,680
For the sake of Danyang

597
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,600
and the baby she is carrying,

598
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,520
I will give you another chance.

599
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,360
You need not worry about me.

600
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
I know what to do.

601
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You just need to
take good care of Danyang.

602
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
If anything bad happens to her,

603
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,760
I won't allow you to get away with it.

604
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,960
I swear I will not let you down,

605
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,520
and I will not betray Danyang's trust.

606
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,920
Thank you for saving me, Shiyi.

607
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,040
I dare not accept your thanks.

608
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
I feel ashamed to say this.

609
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
I ordered the steps
to be fixed urgently.

610
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,000
In normal days,

611
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,600
only His Lordship and the concubines

612
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,280
visit the Western Lateral Court frequently.

613
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,400
So I just notified them of the repair.

614
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,720
I never expected that

615
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,560
you would
pay a visit suddenly today.

616
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,200
When I think of it now,
I am still scared.

617
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,040
If you had got hurt,

618
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,800
I would not be able to make amends
even if I die 100 times.

619
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,840
Shiyi, you overstated the seriousness.

620
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
It is you who have saved me.

621
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,200
I am glad that you are fine.

622
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,720
May I ask why you

623
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,160
have come here today?

624
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,360
I will be honest with you.

625
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,920
I am here today

626
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,960
because I have heard some rumors

627
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,480
about Lingkuan and Fengqing.

628
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,480
Give it to me. Give it to me.

629
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,080
I heard that Lingkuan

630
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,680
is the biological father of Fengqing.

631
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,640
Don't you think this is funny, Shiyi?

632
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,080
So I came here especially
to check it out.

633
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,960
I am surprised that there are
such rumors spreading.

634
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,480
His Lordship has admitted that

635
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,120
Fengqing is his son.

636
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,280
Why are people still gossiping?

637
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,840
Is Fengqing really His Lordship's son?

638
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
Since His Lordship said so,

639
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,760
it is beyond doubt that
Fengqing is his son.

640
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,480
This is a fact.

641
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,040
It will never change.

642
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,320
Well, you don't mind it

643
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,800
at all?

644
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,160
Give it to me. Give it to me.

645
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,640
Fengqing is smart and quick-witted.

646
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,720
He is adorable.

647
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,520
It is not enough
however much I like him.

648
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,560
Moreover,

649
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,880
if I bother His Lordship
with such a matter,

650
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
I will push His Lordship off.

651
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,960
Is that worthwhile?

652
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,000
Since you see me as
your elder sister,

653
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,560
I will give you some advice.

654
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,600
Now you are in the family way,

655
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,720
you'd better ignore

656
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,200
the gossips from others

657
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,800
even if you hear them.

658
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,080
You should know

659
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,120
what is the most
important thing for you.

660
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,960
If you lose the greater for the less,

661
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,920
you will regret.

662
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,960
(I ordered the steps to be fixed urgently.)

663
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,240
(In normal days,)

664
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,640
(only His Lordship and the concubines)

665
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,560
(visit the Western Lateral Court frequently.)

666
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,800
(So I just notified them of the repair.)

667
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,040
Fifth Madam, why are you here?

668
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,080
Why didn't you have
your arrival reported?

669
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,640
Qiao Lianfang.

670
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,720
You are really scheming.

671
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,640
I used to think that you
come from an illustrious family,

672
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,280
so you should be a person of
good conducts and characters.

673
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,400
But I didn't expect that

674
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,160
you are so crooked in mind.

675
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,880
I really don't know how the Qiao family

676
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,440
has been teaching you.

677
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,280
I don't know what I have done wrong

678
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,280
to make you so angry with me.

679
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Look at you.

680
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,040
You are

681
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,600
playing innocent and weak again.

682
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,400
You are

683
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,960
putting on your hypocritical face again.

684
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,120
In ordinary days, only mother

685
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,240
falls for your pretense
because of her soft and kind heart.

686
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
Think about His Lordship.

687
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,720
Has he ever given you

688
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,960
a decent look?

689
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,440
What did you say?

690
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,280
What have I done wrong

691
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,520
to make you insult me like this?

692
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,920
Even if you are a princess,

693
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,480
you can't bully me like this.

694
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,440
You know clearly what you have done.

695
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,760
Do you think that

696
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,840
I don't know your lousy tricks.

697
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,880
You should feel lucky that
I haven't got hurt today.

698
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,520
Otherwise, I will hold you accountable.

699
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
From now on,

700
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,120
you'd better

701
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,440
keep your nose clean.

702
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,800
If I find out that

703
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,160
you play any dirty trick

704
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,040
to do harm to me again,

705
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,720
I will not let you off.

706
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,600
Even though you are a princess,

707
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,630
you can't wrong a good person
without any evidence.

708
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,880
This is no justice.

709
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,190
If you think you are wronged by me,

710
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,360
you are free to go complain to mother

711
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,670
and His Lordship about my doing.

712
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,670
By then, I will take the chance
to reason with you.

713
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,960
I am

714
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,600
only a humble concubine.

715
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,840
How dare I reason with you?

716
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,190
Please take care of your body.

717
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,040
Madam.

718
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,500
(Congeniality in Hearts)

719
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,150
Mind the steps.

720
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,720
Take care, Madam.

721
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,680
Concubine Qiao

722
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,240
circulated rumors
hither and thither previously.

723
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,960
Superficially, she wanted to remind me

724
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
of Fengqing's matter.

725
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,200
I am afraid that

726
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,400
her underlying purpose is

727
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,480
to have me fall over the steps.

728
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,440
Then she can take the chance
to overthrow Shiyi.

729
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,360
It is unexpected that Concubine Qiao

730
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,760
is so black-hearted.

731
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,200
It is a good thing that you have
seen her through.

732
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,760
It is lucky that you were
more scared than hurt.

733
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,520
From today onward,

734
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,120
you mustn't believe the hearsay

735
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,640
and take impulsive actions.

736
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,160
I am very close to

737
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,760
being taken in by her.

738
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,480
You should try to be broad-minded.

739
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
If you always dwell on

740
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,280
trivial matters,

741
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,240
you will be like

742
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,880
the late Her Ladyship.

743
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,920
I got you.

744
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,880
This time,

745
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
I lost my head out of anger

746
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
and fell for her trick.

747
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,600
But fortunately,

748
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,200
Shiyi reminded me that

749
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,360
the most important thing for me now

750
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,200
is the child I am carrying

751
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,680
and the husband-wife affection

752
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,440
between Lingkuan and me.

753
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,600
I am glad that you woke up to it.

754
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,200
You need not mind other things now.

755
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,480
Just try to

756
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,960
give birth to the baby smoothly.

757
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,640
This is the matter of
paramount importance.

758
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
But

759
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,120
I must say that Her Ladyship

760
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,880
is guileless and kind.

761
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,040
In the coming days,

762
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,400
you should try to
spend more time with her.

763
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,120
After all, she is the legal wife
of the Marquis.

764
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,800
It may be possible
in the coming days that

765
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,600
you will need her help.

766
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,120
Though she is a woman of humble birth,

767
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,440
her heart is kind.

768
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,400
She is much nicer than Concubine Qiao.

769
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,920
Danyang.

770
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,520
I didn't see you
when I came back just now.

771
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,440
Where have you been?

772
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,600
I had nothing to do at midday today.

773
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,680
So I dropped in on Shiyi.

774
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,200
Meanwhile, I played
with Fengqing for a while.

775
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,400
What happened to
the fringe of her dress?

776
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,440
When she was
in Her Ladyship's place just now,

777
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,240
she almost fell to the ground

778
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,840
due to the uneven steps.

779
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,240
I am to blame for
not following her closely.

780
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,200
Luckily,

781
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,760
Her Ladyship protected her.

782
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,240
So she didn't get injured.

783
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,400
How could this happen?

784
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,680
From now on, wherever you go,

785
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,000
you must let me keep your company.

786
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,520
With me by your side,

787
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,800
you won't come across any mishap.

788
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,320
OK. I got it.

789
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,720
You see I am fine now.

790
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,480
So stop worrying about me.

791
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
Why is your hair wet?

792
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,120
I was caught up in the rain just now.

793
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,080
Well,

794
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,280
when there is a chance,

795
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,040
I must thank Shiyi

796
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,240
in a proper manner.

797
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,680
By the way,

798
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
Fengqing

799
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,600
is really adorable.

800
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,720
Though he is His Lordship's son,

801
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,720
surprisingly, his eyes resemble yours

802
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,160
to some extent.

803
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,160
He is the offspring
of our Xu family after all.

804
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,960
I heard that

805
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,680
he has been bullied as a kid.

806
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,960
He is lucky to have been brought back
by His Lordship.

807
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,200
Now he is being taken good care of
in our Xu family.

808
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,840
You

809
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,760
should spare some time to visit him.

810
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,200
After all, you are his uncle.

811
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,160
You should spend more time
playing with him.

812
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,760
I know what to do now.

813
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Thank you, Danyang.

814
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,640
Don't mention it.

815
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,440
I only hope that

816
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,120
you won't put me and my baby behind you.

817
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,920
What silly words you said.

818
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,520
You and our baby

819
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,040
are the people I care about the most.

820
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,680
How could I forget you two?

821
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,600
Be careful, Fengqing.

822
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,720
Slow down. Slow down.

823
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,560
Slow down.

824
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,800
Fengqing, you are so clever.

825
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,840
You are such a good boy.

826
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,640
Yizhen.

827
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,560
Shiyi.

828
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,720
Fengqing.

829
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,040
Take Fengqing to play over there.

830
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,720
Yes.

831
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,920
Come with me, Fengqing.

832
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,040
Let's go there to play.

833
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,720
Take a seat, please.

834
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Have you and His Lordship decided on

835
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
who will raise Fengqing?

836
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,000
We haven't made a decision yet.

837
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,280
But I want to discuss about one thing

838
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,680
with you.

839
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,960
What is it?

840
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,440
I can see that

841
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
you and Fengqing really hit it off.

842
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,720
So I wonder

843
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,280
whether you'd like to raise Fengqing.

844
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,520
It's true I am fond of Fengqing.

845
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,360
But I am not fit to be his mother.

846
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
I have no confidence in
taking good care of a child.

847
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,560
I know your worries.

848
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Back then,

849
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,680
if I hadn't been careless,

850
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
my son Qian

851
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
wouldn't have died of the cold.

852
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,760
I am afraid that
I can't look after Fengqing well.

853
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,160
As you can see,

854
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,440
Concubine Qiao and Concubine Qin
both intend to raise him.

855
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,200
But I believe that

856
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,720
you also know

857
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,760
they both have their ulterior motives.

858
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,040
So His Lordship isn't assured of

859
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,560
handing over the custody
of Fengqing to either of them.

860
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,600
Besides,

861
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,200
Fengqing has suffered a lot outside

862
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,640
since his birth.

863
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,840
And he hasn't had any good upbringing.

864
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,600
All kids of our Xu family

865
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,480
have been instructed by you
at the beginning of their learning.

866
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,480
So I believe that

867
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,240
if you are the one who raises him,

868
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,920
he will surely
achieve better growth.

869
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,440
In this family,

870
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,640
only you

871
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,720
can provide a peaceful childhood

872
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,400
for Fengqing.

873
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,400
I can see that

874
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,800
you like Fengqing heartily.

875
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,600
So I said this to you.

876
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,520
If you really have no intention

877
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,320
to adopt Fengqing,

878
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,120
you can just ignore what I said.

879
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,160
However,

880
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,440
if you are hesitating

881
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,240
due to what happened in the past,

882
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,200
I hope that

883
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,680
you can think more about

884
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,920
what choice to make

885
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,800
will be the best for Fengqing.

886
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,640
Of course,

887
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,840
in the end,

888
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,280
we will respect your will.

889
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,600
Then please allow me
to think more about it.

890
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,680
If Yizhen

891
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,000
still can't get over
her emotional trauma in the end...

892
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,680
Then I will raise Fengqing.

893
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,200
If so, your burden will increase.

894
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,600
I don't mind it.

895
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,760
But I still think that

896
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,200
entrusting Yizhen with Fengqing

897
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,520
will be the best result for

898
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,640
both Yizhen

899
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,200
and Fengqing.

900
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,360
Even if you raise Fengqing,

901
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,760
you can't be his mother in name.

902
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,880
Just let Concubine Tong

903
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,240
be his mother in name.

904
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,280
Concubine Tong.

905
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,840
Who is she?

906
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,480
She was Yuanniang's maid.

907
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,880
She has been dead for many years.

908
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,360
You asked about Concubine Tong?

909
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,080
She came with the late Her Ladyship

910
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,600
when late Her Ladyship
married into the Xu family.

911
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,880
While late Her Ladyship was pregnant,

912
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,480
she stealthily seduced His Lordship

913
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,440
when he was drunk.

914
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,120
Thankfully, late Her Ladyship
was magnanimous

915
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,240
and made her concubine.

916
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,560
Why have I never heard about it?

917
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,840
It is a scandal.

918
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,000
If it is made public,
the Xu family will be disgraced.

919
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,440
She resorted to such foul means.

920
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,720
Naturally, His Lordship

921
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,160
held her in contempt.

922
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,000
She was not in favor and had no backers.

923
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,840
As time passed by,

924
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,000
she got depressed and died.

925
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,240
Lingyi.

926
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,000
Fengqing has been in our family

927
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,120
for quite a few days.

928
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,400
Who do you choose

929
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,160
to raise this kid?

930
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,840
Have you made a decision?

931
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,520
Shiyi and I have discussed about it

932
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,720
and reached an agreement.

933
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,920
From now on, Fengqing

934
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,200
will be in the custody of...
