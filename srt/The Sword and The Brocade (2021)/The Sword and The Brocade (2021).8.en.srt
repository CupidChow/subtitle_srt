From now on,

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
you must get along well.

Go.

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,720
Zhun.

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Zhun, come.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,480
That is your mother.

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,920
Call her mother.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
Zhun.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
I told you about her.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,720
Call her mother.

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,320
Zhun, look.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,400
Do you like this perfume satchel?

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,960
I heard that you're
an illegitimate daughter.

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
But my mother was a legitimate daughter.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,520
So you're not my mother.

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,720
Zhun.

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,440
Don't be rude.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,440
Mother, it's fine.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
I'll talk to Zhun.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,960
Zhun, let me ask you.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,800
Who is your mother

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,240
to your father?

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,920
Zhun.

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,480
I told you about it.

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,760
You surely remember it.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,360
My mother is father's wife.

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,960
Then who am I

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,320
to your father?

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,040
Nanny Tao said

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
that father married you.

55
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,440
You're father's wife.

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,280
That's right.

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
So

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
you call

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,480
your father's wife mother.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm also your father's wife.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
What should you call me?

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
Mother?

63
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,640
Good boy.

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,400
Come, Zhun.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,840
I prepared

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
this gift for you.

67
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,720
I placed many dried flowers inside.

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,360
Smell it. It smells good.

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,680
It smells so good.

70
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
Zhun.

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,200
Your favorite

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,800
rose jelly is ready.

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
Do you want some?

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,320
Yes.

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,519
Don't be anxious.

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,320
Wipe your hands.

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,480
Wipe them clean.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,200
Here.

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,120
Take it.

80
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
Zhun.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
It's time for your morning class.

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,520
Go.

83
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,760
Meet your teacher.

84
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,520
Yes.

85
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,080
Zhun, let's go.

86
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,920
Dan Yang.

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,880
Let's hurry up, all right?

88
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,720
Today, Shiyi

89
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
is greeting mother for the first time.

90
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,600
If Yuanniang didn't pull so many tricks,

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,360
why would the Xu family

92
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
let an illegitimate daughter
marry into the family?

93
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm a princess.

94
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
I can't believe I'll become in-laws

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
with an illegitimate daughter.

96
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,160
How can I face everyone
in the future?

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,720
You're the princess

98
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,080
that His Majesty personally appointed.

99
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
You have a high status.

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,320
Who would dare

101
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
to laugh at you?

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,000
Even if outsiders don't dare
to say anything,

103
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,040
if you want me to call
an illegitimate daughter

104
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,240
Sister-in-law,

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,920
I can't do it.

106
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,920
Lingyi gave Shiyi

107
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
an official wedding.

108
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,320
Just do it for Lingyi,

109
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,000
all right?

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,720
If you infuriate Lingyi,

111
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,320
he'll surely deal with me harshly.

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
Look at you.

113
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,440
Can't you be more ambitious?

114
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,520
Back then,

115
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,600
didn't you like my unambitious,

116
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,120
carefree and rebellious side?

117
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,840
My dear.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
Slow down.

119
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,280
You just got pregnant.

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,240
You must be careful.

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,960
Let's go.

122
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
Thank you, father-in-law,

123
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,120
for helping me
at the session today.

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,840
You're welcome.

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
It concerns the ancestral policy.

126
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,800
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

127
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,959
Why did you stop me earlier?

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,920
His Majesty won't attend
the imperial court.

129
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
After Grand Secretary Liu retired,

130
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
Grand Secretary Chen
is the most powerful.

131
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,080
We want to change
the ancestral policy.

132
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,920
That's already overstepping.

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
If we infuriate Grand Secretary,

134
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,200
then we can't turn the situation
around anymore.

135
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,440
Mother.

136
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,600
Greetings, Shiyi.

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
Greetings, Shiyi.

138
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,480
Lingkuan, Your Highness.

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,200
I heard that you just got pregnant,
Your Highness,

140
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
so I made something that will be easy

141
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,640
for you to mix and match with.

142
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
When your stomach gets bigger,

143
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
you should be able to use it.

144
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,080
I hope you'll accept it.

145
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,280
Thank you, Shiyi.

146
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,680
But I'm pregnant right now.

147
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
I just want to be comfortable
in what I wear.

148
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm afraid I've wasted

149
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,600
your efforts.

150
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Thank you, Shiyi.

151
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,280
(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)

152
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,600
(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)
The sea ban is a national policy

153
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,840
established by Emperor Taizu.

154
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,240
Lifting it

155
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,160
means abolishing our ancestral policy.

156
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
If His Majesty has no intentions
of doing so,

157
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,640
Grand Secretary Chen

158
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
will surely protect
the royal family's dignity

159
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,640
and rebuke Marquis Yongping.

160
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,320
He didn't say anything,

161
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,280
which means his stand is clear already.

162
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,000
What should we do then?

163
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,360
Once the sea ban is lifted,
trading will start.

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,160
Our smuggling business with the pirates

165
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,440
will be over.

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
If we stop getting benefits from this,

167
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
the efforts that the Ou family put in
all these years

168
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
will be wasted.

169
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,480
What if

170
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,080
regarding Xu Lingyi, we...

171
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,240
Xu Lingyi got his marquis title

172
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,920
from countless battles.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,720
How can it be easily...

174
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,560
But Xu Lingyi is slowly
becoming stronger.

175
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,480
He has a great feud with the Ou family.

176
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,680
He'll surely become a big issue for us
in the future.

177
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Mr. Zhu.

178
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,760
Tell us.

179
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Is there anything we can do

180
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
to deal with this?

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
His Majesty has always been suspicious.

182
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,480
Even if he's a bit inclined

183
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,560
to lift the sea ban,

184
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,720
he was just

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,040
observing how the officials
will react.

186
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Otherwise, he would have long written
an imperial order

187
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
and abolished the sea ban.

188
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,080
As long as more people

189
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,480
in the government

190
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,840
are supporting the ancestral policy,

191
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,200
it can surely influence His Majesty,

192
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,000
and the danger will be resolved.

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Duke Wei, Ren Kun,

194
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,600
is His Majesty's trusted official.

195
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,120
Ren Kun is stubborn and intractable.

196
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,680
He won't be easy to win over.

197
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,560
The Ministries of War and Justice

198
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,840
look up to you for instructions.

199
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,200
The Ministry of Rituals adheres
to past practices.

200
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,000
And its minister, Minister Zhou,

201
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,520
is your father-in-law.

202
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,840
There's no problem there too.

203
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,400
Marquis Yongping's foundation
is the Ministry of Revenue.

204
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,920
What if we do it from there?

205
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,920
Watch the Xu family closely.

206
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,240
I want to know

207
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,600
Xu Lingyi's every move.

208
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,120
Great Madam.

209
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
Before,

210
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,160
since Second Madam was sick

211
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,840
and Her Highness is pregnant,

212
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,520
I exceed my authority

213
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,360
and managed the household affairs.

214
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Now,

215
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,960
Her Ladyship has already married
into the family.

216
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
The mansion's affairs

217
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,600
should be managed by her.

218
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm not familiar
with the Xu family's rules yet.

219
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm afraid I can't handle
such a huge responsibility.

220
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,800
You're the legal wife.

221
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,480
You should be
in charge of household affairs.

222
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,160
Go inside.

223
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,000
Kneel down.

224
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Great Madam.

225
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,919
This maid stole

226
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,240
the Sichuan brocade given by
His Majesty.

227
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
Good thing someone found out.

228
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,760
That's why His Majesty's gift

229
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,039
didn't leave the mansion.

230
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,679
Please provide instructions

231
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,000
on how to deal with her.

232
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
You're so bold.

233
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,919
Do you know what will happen

234
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
if you sell His Majesty's gift?

235
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Great Madam, spare me.

236
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,120
Your Highness, spare me.

237
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
I won't do it again.

238
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,720
I won't do it again.

239
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,960
Tell me.

240
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,160
What should we do with her?

241
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,520
Shiyi.

242
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,400
You go first.

243
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,080
Mother.

244
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,720
May I ask her some questions first?

245
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,840
Why did you steal the Sichuan brocade
given by His Majesty?

246
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Your Ladyship, spare me.

247
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,600
My mother is extremely sick.

248
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,440
She needs to take ginseng.

249
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
But ginseng is too expensive.

250
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,760
I can't afford it.

251
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,440
I had no choice,

252
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,680
so I stole from the mansion

253
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,040
and sold them outside.

254
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,360
I didn't know

255
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
that it was from His Majesty.

256
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,240
Please spare me this once.

257
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,640
I won't do it again.

258
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,320
Mother.

259
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,240
Even if she shouldn't have stolen
from us,

260
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,160
it was because of her filial piety.

261
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,640
I think she already knows her mistake.

262
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,640
What if we flog her 20 times

263
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,760
as punishment?

264
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,640
It can be considered
as a lesson for her.

265
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,200
Great Madam.

266
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,240
A nation has its laws,
and a family has its rules.

267
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,320
If everything is excusable,

268
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,080
then it's like the rules and laws
only exist in name.

269
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,840
I think

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
we should sell her.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is according to the house rules.

272
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
Don't, Great Madam.

273
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,600
I won't do it again.

274
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,640
I still need

275
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,360
to take care of my mother.

276
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,800
Great Madam, please.

277
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,200
Great Madam, I'm begging you.

278
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,600
You knew it would come to this,
why did you do it in the first place?

279
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,920
If we don't punish you today,

280
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,640
how can we discipline others
in the future?

281
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
Lianfang is right.

282
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,840
Reward and punishment should be clear.

283
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,920
That's how you manage a household affairs.

284
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,680
Take her away.

285
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,160
Call the slave trader.

286
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,360
Mother.

287
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,280
Isn't this punishment

288
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
too severe?

289
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,880
Take her away.

290
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,720
Let's go.

291
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,560
Great Madam, I was wrong!

292
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,360
Spare me, Great Madam!

293
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,800
Let's go.

294
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,360
I...

295
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
-Great Madam!
-Mother.

296
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,120
What if we bring her

297
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
to our house outside the city?

298
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,520
That will serve as a punishment for her,

299
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,200
and the Xu family won't appear heartless

300
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
towards servants.

301
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,160
Thank you, Great Madam.

302
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,320
Thank you, Second Madam.

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,160
Stand up.

304
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,880
Let's go.

305
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,640
Shiyi.

306
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,520
You just married into the family,

307
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,600
there are many things
you still don't know.

308
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
So

309
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,600
Lianfang will manage the household affairs for now.

310
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
After you slowly become familiar
with the house rules,

311
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,400
we shall see.

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,200
Yes, Mother.

313
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,960
Great Madam, how can I do that?

314
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,120
After all, I'm not the legal wife.

315
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,960
I know that it's difficult for you.

316
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
Just do it for the Xu family

317
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,680
and for Lingyi.

318
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,720
Stop declining.

319
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,680
Yes, Great Madam.

320
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,640
I'm sorry about this, Your Ladyship.

321
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,680
Great Madam.

322
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,680
We got the Sichuan brocade
from His Majesty back.

323
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,160
That's great.

324
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
This Sichuan brocade is so intricate.

325
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,560
Give me a few to make my clothes.

326
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,240
Of course we can't neglect you.

327
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,360
Ask the servants

328
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,200
to send a few pieces over to you.

329
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,480
If I start getting them made now,

330
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,320
I can wear them
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

331
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,800
It's just that
with such beautiful Sichuan brocade,

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,680
if I don't have

333
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,280
a few exquisite fans

334
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,200
to match them,

335
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,960
it seems like something's missing.

336
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Speaking of fans,

337
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,120
Color Embroidery Workshop
has the best ones.

338
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,800
Color Embroidery Workshop

339
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,080
only has limited designs.

340
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,520
I've long gotten tired of them.

341
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,280
I know a thing or two about embroidery.

342
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,440
In Yuhang,

343
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,400
I've seen some novel designs.

344
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,000
If you don't mind, Princess Dan Yang,

345
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,800
I can provide a few embroidery designs
for the fans.

346
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,440
Shiyi, you're skilled in needlework?

347
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,680
Your Highness.

348
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
Her Ladyship's teacher is Master Jian
from Color Embroidery Workshop.

349
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,920
She's very skillful in embroidery.

350
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,760
When we were in Yuhang,

351
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,280
she's already very popular.

352
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,720
Is that so?

353
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,320
Mother.

354
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,560
What if we let Shiyi have a try?

355
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,000
Great Madam, His Lordship is here.

356
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,440
Lingyi is home.

357
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,880
Greetings, Mother.

358
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,880
There's no need for courtesy.

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
Why did you come out?

360
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
The weather's so nice today.

361
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,400
I'm tired from staying indoors,

362
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,120
so I came out to get some sun.

363
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,520
My Lord, you're back so early today.

364
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
Have you eaten?

365
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll ask the kitchen to heat up
the bird's nest porridge.

366
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,560
I've already eaten outside.

367
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,480
Zhun.

368
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,240
Zhun, slow down.

369
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,320
Zhun.

370
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,040
Are you done with your homework?

371
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,600
Zhun.

372
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,160
You should be in your morning class.
Why are you here?

373
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
Speak.

374
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,280
My Lord.

375
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Zhun has been practicing.

376
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,200
He's working very hard.

377
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,680
He heard that you're home,

378
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,840
so he especially came to see you.

379
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,600
Shut up.

380
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,880
Come with me.

381
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,720
Stand here.

382
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Do the horse stance.

383
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,200
Lower.

384
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
You're a man.

385
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,920
Why are you crying?

386
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,760
It's just been a short while,

387
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,800
and you can't endure it anymore.

388
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,840
Since ancient times, those who want
to accomplish great things

389
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,240
must experience frustrations

390
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
and physical exhaustion first.

391
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,160
You can't even do the horse stance well.

392
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
How can you accomplish great things?

393
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,240
-Hey.
-Zhun.

394
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,400
Why are you so strict

395
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
towards such a small child?

396
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,240
He's just a child.

397
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,960
He's not your soldier.

398
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
I... when I was

399
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,560
at his age,

400
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,920
I wasn't as squeamish as him.

401
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
That's nonsense.

402
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
When you were his age,

403
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
in practicing martial arts
for half an hour,

404
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,880
you'd go to the restroom ten times.

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,760
I was so scared that I asked
the imperial physician to check on you.

406
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,040
I thought you got some sort of illness.

407
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,840
Mother.

408
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,200
You're mistaken.

409
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,200
That was Lingkuan.

410
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,640
Mother, it wasn't me.

411
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,480
Lingkuan.

412
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,680
Think about it carefully first.

413
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,920
Mother, I was mistaken.

414
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,960
That was me.

415
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,160
When it was snowing
and Lingyi had a fever,

416
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,400
he still practiced martial arts.

417
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,840
Zhun.

418
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,800
Come.

419
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
Come to grandmother.

420
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,440
Let's go back to the room
and have some cake.

421
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,520
Let's have cake.

422
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
Your Ladyship, I didn't expect

423
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,480
that His Lordship would be so naughty
when he was little.

424
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,440
His Lordship is too strict.

425
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,240
Zhun

426
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,840
is his legitimate son after all.

427
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
He doesn't feel bad for him at all.

428
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,800
When Yuanniang died,

429
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,120
she told me to take care of Zhun.

430
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Originally, I wanted to bring him back

431
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,120
to the Western Lateral Court
to take good care of him.

432
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,880
But mother wants

433
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,680
to continue raising him by her side.

434
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,040
I think she can't bear to part with him.

435
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,080
Your Ladyship, that's Concubine Qiao.

436
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,480
What's the matter?

437
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,240
You want to go over there

438
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,120
and argue with her?

439
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,840
Then...

440
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,920
She's managing the household affairs now.

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,680
If she charges you

442
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,960
for insubordination,

443
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,120
I can't help you.

444
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:48,640
Your Ladyship.

445
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,880
You worked so hard

446
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,080
to give this to Zhun.

447
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,719
Concubine Qiao does't respect you

448
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,479
at all.

449
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,440
She and His Lordship
are fond of each other.

450
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,800
Originally, she could have been
the legal wife of the Xu family.

451
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,120
Yet because of Yuanniang,

452
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,760
she's a concubine now.

453
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:03,080
It's understandable for her to hate me.

454
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,199
So we'll just let her

455
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,880
bully us?

456
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,880
Even if I won't cause
any trouble myself,

457
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,520
I won't let others bully me either.

458
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,960
This isn't a peaceful and quiet place.

459
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,720
From now on, you and I

460
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,200
must be extra careful.

461
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,320
How troublesome.

462
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
You just married into this family.

463
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,480
Silly girl.

464
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,720
Don't worry.

465
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,840
You have me.

466
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,680
Go.

467
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,520
Bring this perfume satchel to Nanny Tao.

468
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,520
Have you heard?

469
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,240
Last night, His Lordship slept
at the Western Lateral Court

470
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
the whole night.

471
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,480
A man discards the old

472
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,880
when he has someone new.

473
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
He officially married Her Ladyship.

474
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,840
And it was their wedding night.

475
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,280
Of course His Lordship must pay
more attention.

476
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,400
I understand.

477
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,160
The problem is

478
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,200
does Concubine Qiao understand?

479
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,320
Because Great Madam likes her,

480
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,640
she acts like the legal wife.

481
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,680
She never

482
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,840
looks at us.

483
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,240
So

484
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,280
it's also good for the new wife to marry
into the family,

485
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
so that she'll know her place.

486
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Stop.

487
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,200
I heard that last night,

488
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,920
His Lordship

489
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,560
stayed overnight at the Western
Lateral Court.

490
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,080
That's how it is

491
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,160
for the legal wife.

492
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,520
The legal wife is different indeed.

493
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,600
Even if

494
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
she's a lowly, illegitimate daughter...

495
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,000
Greetings.

496
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,840
You're here.

497
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,240
I'll sit down first.

498
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,960
Have a seat.

499
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,160
Jade.

500
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
Today is the first day

501
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,240
that Her Ladyship went
to greet Great Madam.

502
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,440
What did Great Madam give her?

503
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,080
Of course Great Madam

504
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,680
gave her good gifts.

505
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,720
But Great Madam said

506
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,240
that Her Ladyship just married
into the family.

507
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,520
She's not very familiar

508
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
with the affairs of the household affairs yet,

509
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,240
so she continued

510
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,720
letting me manage the household affairs.

511
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Her Ladyship has already married
into the family.

512
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240
You're still managing the household affairs?

513
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,800
Great Madam trusts me.

514
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,080
I can't decline either.

515
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,400
I can only accept it.

516
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,200
Then...

517
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,680
then congratulations.

518
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
You're the descendant
of a prominent family indeed.

519
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,680
You're different.

520
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,200
You've seen a lot and have
a broad range of knowledge.

521
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,680
How can Her Ladyship compare to you?

522
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,880
From now on, please take care of us.

523
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,000
There's something

524
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,960
I want to discuss

525
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,240
with both of you.

526
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,120
Her Ladyship

527
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,440
wants to make fan embroidery designs

528
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,960
for each of us.

529
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,360
She has good intentions,

530
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,400
but I'm a bit worried.

531
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,040
After all, she's
an illegitimate daughter.

532
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,440
Her outlook is limited.

533
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,240
Our clothing

534
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,440
and accessories

535
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,520
represent the Xu family.

536
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,960
Of course it can't be

537
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,440
taken lightly.

538
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,600
Don't worry.

539
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,280
When we go to Western Lateral Court,

540
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,360
I'll bring

541
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,240
all my best embroidery items

542
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,440
to broaden her horizons.

543
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,240
I'll go ahead then.

544
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,040
Get ready first.

545
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,840
Take care.

546
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,280
What was her intention?

547
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,920
She's afraid

548
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,960
that Her Ladyship will use
the opportunity of giving us fans

549
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,240
to get close to us,

550
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
so she's instigating us.

551
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,480
Then

552
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,920
what should we do?

553
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,880
Now,

554
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,520
I can only bring
my best embroidery items

555
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,160
to Western Lateral Court.

556
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,120
I can't really say anything.

557
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,040
After all, she's still managing

558
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,520
the household affairs.

559
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,280
But we can take the opportunity to see

560
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,400
what kind of matron

561
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,960
Her Ladyship is.

562
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,600
Your Ladyship has already married
into this family.

563
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,920
Great Madam is still letting Concubine Qiao

564
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,240
manage the household affairs.

565
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,480
Isn't Great Madam

566
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,800
playing favorites?

567
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
I didn't marry into the Xu family

568
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,760
for that purpose.

569
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
It's fine.

570
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
Your Ladyship, I've already found out

571
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,240
what you wanted me to check.

572
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,360
Tell me.

573
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,560
Great Madam

574
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,520
wakes up at 5 a.m.

575
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,000
So everyone will greet her from 7 a.m.

576
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,200
to a little past 9 a.m.

577
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,280
Then she'll go to the abbey
to light incense.

578
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
She'll eat at lunchtime,

579
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720
then in the afternoon,

580
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,840
Great Madam will
play with Zhun for a while

581
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,040
or find Concubine Qiao

582
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,640
and Fifth Madam to play cards.

583
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,320
She'll eat dinner
between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

584
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,320
After dinner, she'll take a walk
in the yard.

585
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,720
She goes to bed around 7 p.m..

586
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
Thank you, Amber.

587
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,040
You're welcome, Your Ladyship.

588
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
It's part of my job.

589
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,160
As for the other concubines,

590
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
I heard

591
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,960
that His Lordship is always
on the battlefield,

592
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,280
and he neglects his wives.

593
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,760
So none of the three concubines are favored.

594
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,600
None of them are favored?

595
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,480
Concubines Wen and Qin

596
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,160
have been with His Lordship
for many years,

597
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
but their situations

598
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
are different.

599
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,440
I heard that when His Lordship

600
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,280
was battling at the border,

601
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,080
the battle was very difficult
because the logistics were bad.

602
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,320
The Wen family donated

603
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,520
a lot of money and provisions

604
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,440
to help His Lordship pull through.

605
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,480
Since then,

606
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
His Lordship made Concubine Wen

607
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
his concubine.

608
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
It seems like the Wen family
grabbed the opportunity

609
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,160
to get connected to the Xu family
in marriage.

610
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,560
Concubine Qin

611
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
was originally the maid

612
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,000
of Great Madam.

613
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,120
Great Madam likes her for being
docile and thoughtful,

614
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,440
so she sent him to serve His Lordship.

615
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,880
One time, His Lordship was wounded
and went into a coma.

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,920
Concubine Qin was the one who stayed
with His Lordship

617
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
and took care of him
for a period of time.

618
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,560
After His Lordship woke up,

619
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
Great Madam decided

620
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
to let him take her as his concubine.

621
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,280
But regardless if it's Concubine Wen

622
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,680
or Concubine Qin,

623
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,400
it seems like

624
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,360
they're not favored by His Lordship.

625
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,280
That's strange.

626
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,520
Forget about Concubine Wen

627
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,600
and Concubine Qin,

628
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,880
why is Concubine Qiao
in the same situation?

629
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,560
Great Madam and Madam Qiao

630
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,080
are cousins.

631
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,440
The Xu and Qiao families

632
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,760
are also close to each other.

633
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,720
Yes.

634
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,320
But...

635
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm not sure either.

636
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,480
His Lordship doesn't seem like

637
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
a man

638
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,960
with no desires.

639
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,840
Is there a special reason?

640
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,560
His Lordship is always
on the battlefield.

641
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Could it be

642
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,960
that he has a hidden illness?

643
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Don't speak nonsense.

644
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,440
Your Ladyship.

645
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,360
Your Ladyship.

646
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,640
Your Ladyship.

647
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,680
Why haven't you

648
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,040
changed your clothes yet?

649
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,800
Hurry.

650
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,680
Dongqing, Amber.

651
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
Help get Her Ladyship prepared.

652
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,440
Get Her Ladyship her clothes.

653
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,680
Your Ladyship.

654
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,640
The concubines

655
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,240
are still waiting to bow to you
and serve you tea.

656
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,480
By the way, Your Ladyship,

657
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,160
you must wear some accessories.

658
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,080
Oh, right, Your Ladyship.

659
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Your Ladyship.

660
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,160
It's so rare to find southern pearls

661
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,640
of the same size like lotus seeds

662
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,120
and make them into a pair of earrings.

663
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,040
Your Ladyship.

664
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
Concubine Wen

665
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,040
is from a family of merchants.

666
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,440
She has sharp eyes.

667
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
We can't let her look down on us.

668
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,200
Come, Dongqing.

669
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,680
Put these on Her Ladyship.

670
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,560
Right.

671
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,240
This red one.

672
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,560
Now, in the entire household affairs,

673
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,760
only you

674
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
look good in bright red.

675
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,760
Dongqing.

676
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,600
Bring the sandalwood boxes

677
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
we prepared later.

678
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,720
Those are gifts

679
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,840
for the concubines.

680
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,480
All right.

681
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,760
Your Ladyship.

682
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,200
You don't need to mind them.

683
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,200
They're just concubines.

684
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,040
If you're pleased,

685
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,520
be nice to them.

686
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
If not,

687
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
kick them out.

688
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,800
Madams.

689
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,960
Please come in.

690
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,120
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

691
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,600
We haven't seen each other for a year.

692
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,000
You're still in such high spirits.

693
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,240
Don't tease me, Wen.

694
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,760
Concubines, please offer the tea.

695
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,000
Your Ladyship, please have some tea.

696
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,600
Thank you for your gift.

697
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,600
The tea is very hot.
I'm afraid it might hurt you.

698
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,080
Be careful.

699
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,920
The one who wants to wear a crown
must bear its weight.

700
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,880
Lianfang, don't worry.

701
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,240
Thank you for your gift.

702
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,320
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

703
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,760
In the future,

704
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
I hope that we can all get along

705
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,480
and share His Lordship's burdens.

706
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,200
All right.

707
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,440
It's getting late.

708
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,040
Go and rest, Concubines.

709
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,000
Is there anything else?

710
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,280
We've heard that you want

711
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
to design some embroideries for fans,

712
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,240
so we've decided

713
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,600
to show you

714
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,360
our best embroidery items.

715
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,160
We hope that they will be able
to help you.

716
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,520
This peacock among the flowers design

717
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,840
is exquisite indeed.

718
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,640
You have good taste indeed.

719
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,280
I spent 1,000 pounds of gold

720
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,280
to buy it
from Color Embroidery Workshop.

721
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm afraid

722
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,000
that since you've stayed in Yuhang
for so long,

723
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
you're not aware of the preferences
in the capital.

724
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,000
That's why we especially brought these
for your reference.

725
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,960
It's a rare and precious item.

726
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,320
The stitches are very intricate.

727
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
It thoroughly expresses

728
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,520
the mother's love for her child

729
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,920
between the cow and her calf.

730
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,400
It's amazing.

731
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,960
The relationship between a mother
and a child

732
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,760
is the most selfless one.

733
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,160
That's why it moved you.

734
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,840
Shiliu is right.

735
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,560
Your Ladyship.

736
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,400
Aside from these, there are more.

737
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,160
Please look at them one by one.

738
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,120
You all

739
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,800
are such a great help.

740
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,240
Dongqing.

741
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Keep these embroidery items well.

742
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
After this matter is done,

743
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,720
we'll return it to them.

744
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,280
Yes.

745
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,320
Your Ladyship.

746
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,800
We're looking forward to your work.

747
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,000
We'll go ahead.

748
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
Amber, see them off.

749
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,560
Yes.

750
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,120
Your Ladyship, look.

751
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,680
Look at them.

752
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,480
They all have their intentions.

753
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,440
They all have ulterior motives.

754
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,160
Who knows

755
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,720
what their intentions are?

756
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,600
You shouldn't have thanked them.

757
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,360
Why did you thank them?

758
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,440
-All right.
-Who knows...

759
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,640
All right.

760
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,920
You may go too.

761
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,160
His Lordship will be back soon.

762
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,880
After he returns,

763
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,720
Her Ladyship must still serve him.

764
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Go.

765
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,000
Your Ladyship, look at them.

766
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,040
Go.

767
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,760
All day long,

768
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,640
she's like a mother hen.

769
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,920
She kept nagging

770
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,040
all day long.

771
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
That's enough.

772
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,640
See that look
in Her Ladyship's eyes.

773
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,960
When she saw the embroidery items,

774
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,480
her eyes were shining.

775
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,840
She hasn't seen much
of the world indeed.

776
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,440
With such spectacular work
for reference,

777
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,120
if she can't make something even better,

778
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,480
how can she provide an explanation

779
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,120
to Great Madam and Her Highness?

780
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,040
Your Ladyship.

781
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,760
Did you see

782
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,000
their looks just now?

783
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,640
They're obviously looking down on us.

784
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,800
Peacock among the flowers?

785
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,760
It's nice,

786
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,320
but it's last year's design.

787
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,920
They're not even embarrassed
to show it to us.

788
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,480
It's just Concubine Qiao's plan

789
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,360
to hit two birds with one stone.

790
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,160
Hit two birds with one stone?

791
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,280
She wants to use these embroidery items

792
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,800
to make me back off,

793
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,400
and she can even use this to sow discord

794
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,000
between me and the two other concubines.

795
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,000
Isn't that hitting two birds
with one stone?

796
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,280
Why did you agree

797
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,800
to make fan designs for them then?

798
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,480
Aren't you giving Concubine Qiao

799
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,880
an opportunity to pull tricks?

800
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,360
Silly girl.

801
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,000
Have you forgotten

802
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,240
why we came to the Xu family?

803
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,960
Your Ladyship wants to use this matter

804
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,760
to check their embroidery items?

805
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,120
In over a year,

806
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,720
we got

807
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,040
a few clues.

808
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,360
It's just that too many people

809
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,640
went to Ci'an Temple that day.

810
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,320
Great Madam, Second Madam,

811
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,320
Princess Dan Yang,

812
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,560
and the three concubines.

813
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,760
Not only that,

814
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,160
their maids and servants

815
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,360
also went there.

816
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,440
We must check them one by one.

817
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,680
After checking for so long,

818
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,480
none of them looked like it.

819
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,080
Do you still remember

820
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,320
the governor from the southeast,
Official Hu,

821
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,600
who was executed six months ago because
he didn't defend the coast well?

822
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,680
How can I forget?

823
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,560
Official Hu showed me a great favor.

824
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,546
Yet I couldn't do anything when he
encountered difficulties.

825
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,620
(Fan Weigang)

826
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,920
Now, his only daughter Liansong

827
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,520
was sent to the Royal Academy.

828
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,640
I can only

829
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,400
do my best to take care of her a bit.

830
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,840
After Official Hu died,

831
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,960
Marquis Jingyuan relied on his cousin,

832
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,320
who is the Regional Military
Assistant Commissioner in Fujian,

833
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,520
to indirectly control

834
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,440
most of the military affairs
in the southeastern region.

835
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,360
The pirates that Official Hu suppressed

836
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,520
suddenly resurged.

837
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,760
You mean

838
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
that the pirates and Official Hu's death

839
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,320
are related to the Ou family?

840
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,880
A year ago,

841
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,320
Jiang Huai escaped from my camp,

842
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,480
so I started suspecting

843
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
that someone in the government
is colluding with pirates.

844
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,840
Later on,

845
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,880
the two of them died consecutively,

846
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,240
so I ran out of clues.

847
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,680
I get it now.

848
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,840
That's why today,

849
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,280
you intentionally mentioned
the sea ban again

850
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,960
to alarm them

851
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,880
and lure them out.

852
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,960
Gaining profit in risk

853
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
is better than not doing anything.

854
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,880
However,

855
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,280
you must be extra careful.

856
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,880
I'm afraid that being rash

857
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,039
might bring trouble upon yourself.

858
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,039
Don't worry, I know my limits.

859
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
Besides, based on what happened today,

860
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,559
it seems like it's effective.

861
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,599
Effective?

862
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,880
What do you mean, My Lord?

863
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,960
Today, I've noticed that Duke Wei

864
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,440
has been uncharacteristically quiet.

865
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,840
I'm afraid it's also because

866
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,680
Official Hu's death

867
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,920
still raises some disputes.

868
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,599
After all, when Official Hu was alive,

869
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,280
they were bosom friends.

870
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
Right.

871
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Usually, even if Duke Wei

872
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,200
wouldn't clearly

873
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,599
talk about the abolishment
of the sea ban,

874
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,559
since it concerns the ancestral policy,

875
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,760
he'll choose to avoid the topic.

876
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,519
It was very rare for him to speak

877
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,880
about the benefits
of lifting the sea ban.

878
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,480
Even if he still remained neutral,

879
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,000
you can tell

880
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,000
that he wasn't at peace.

881
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,800
That's why

882
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,680
perhaps we can use

883
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,040
what happened to Official Hu

884
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,360
to approach Duke Wei.

885
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,520
He's not an old-fashioned man.

886
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
As long as we use reason

887
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,280
and sentiment to move him,

888
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
I believe that Duke Wei

889
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,000
can understand the pros and cons.

890
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,400
Good idea.

891
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,120
Duke Wei

892
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,160
is the older brother
of Noble Consort Lu.

893
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,920
He's a royal relative.

894
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,840
In front of His Majesty,

895
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,800
he has always been able to speak.

896
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,160
If we get his support,

897
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,040
we'll be able to get more help

898
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,840
in the government.

899
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,400
Exactly.

900
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,000
My Lord.

901
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,480
My Lord.

902
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,600
It's late.

903
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,480
Where will you sleep tonight?

904
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,200
Tomorrow is the day the bride
visits her family.

905
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,280
Let's go to Western Lateral Court.

906
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,240
Yes, My Lord.

907
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,960
What's the matter?

908
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,080
Well... it's late.

909
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,440
His Lordship isn't here yet.

910
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,120
So what?

911
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,360
Tonight is the second night

912
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,520
of your marriage to His Lordship.

913
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,040
If he doesn't come,

914
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,560
then...

915
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,720
His Lordship is back.

916
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,240
My Lord.

917
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,280
(What is he doing?)

918
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,560
His clothes.

919
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,480
His clothes.

920
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,920
Are you sure you want to stand
so far away?

921
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,920
Isn't it tiring?

922
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,160
No.

923
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,520
It's not.

924
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,040
Remove the belt first.

925
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm sorry.

926
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,000
I'll do it myself.

927
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,320
My Lord.

928
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
The water is ready.

929
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,160
Go ahead.

930
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,320
Wait.

931
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,160
Test the water temperature.

932
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,800
Yes.

933
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
My Lord, the water temperature
is just right.

934
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,360
This is just right?

935
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,520
Those who want to accomplish
great things

936
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,800
must experience frustrations,

937
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,000
physical exhaustion and hunger first.

938
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,120
If you can't even endure

939
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,280
this water temperature,

940
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,920
how can you be the head of the family?

941
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,600
Since ancient times, those who want
to accomplish great things

942
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,680
must experience frustrations

943
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,800
and physical exhaustion first.

944
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,600
You can't even do the horse stance well.

945
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,880
How can you accomplish great things?

946
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,000
Wait.

947
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,560
What can I do for you, My Lord?

948
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,160
The water is too hot.

949
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,720
It's part of physical exhaustion.

950
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,200
Endure it a bit.

951
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,960
Endure this water temperature,

952
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,920
it will be over soon.

953
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,920
If you think it's appropriate,

954
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,000
bathe in it.

955
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,360
There's no need.

956
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
My Lord, that's not necessary.

957
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,400
I'll ask the maids to get you
some cold water.

958
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,200
Dongqing.

959
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,440
Hurry, get some cold water.

960
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,920
Yes, Your Ladyship.

961
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,280
Wait, I'll go with you.

962
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,960
Why?

963
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,680
Are you afraid

964
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
that I can't carry it on my own?

965
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,160
Based on His Lordship's tone,

966
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,640
I'm afraid that one bucket isn't enough.

967
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,440
He should be asleep.

968
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,960
(I don't care anymore.)

969
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,840
(It's not like we haven't slept
beside each other before.)
