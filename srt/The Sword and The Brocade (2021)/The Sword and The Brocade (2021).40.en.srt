Here is another toast to you.

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,560
Now that I'm thinking back,

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
late Her Ladyship

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,360
carried so much clout at home.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,920
Pitiful concubines

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,160
like me

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,910
don't matter

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,600
to His Lordship.

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,800
Madam, there are things you don't know.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,360
You only saw the apparent clout

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,240
of late Her Ladyship.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,680
You have no idea
how miserable she actually was.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
What do you mean?

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,160
His Lordship respected her so much.

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,560
Even though he took

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
her maid Biyu as his concubine,

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,280
he barely visited Biyu

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
to protect

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,440
her feelings.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,840
There's another level of truth

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,760
to the Biyu situation.

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,680
What level of truth?

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
Back in the day

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,880
when late Her Ladyship
was pregnant with Zhun,

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
she couldn't bed His Lordship.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,320
She wanted to stay
in His Lordship's favor,

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,920
so she made Biyu

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,200
his concubine.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,880
I see.

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,680
By the way, Madam,

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,520
I'm only

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,680
telling you this.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Don't let any outsider know.

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
Rest easy.

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,880
I'll keep this

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,240
secret.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
But

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,160
it makes me wonder.

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,520
His Lordship

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,520
didn't even regard Qiao Lianfang highly

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,040
who comes from a predominant family.

61
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Why would he fancy Biyu?

62
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,560
Biyu refused

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,920
to be his concubine

64
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,760
at first.

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,520
So

66
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,680
late Her Ladyship

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,440
used a little trick.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,560
What trick?

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
Biyu

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,160
had a younger sister.

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,000
Biyu had a younger sister?

72
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,200
I never

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
knew that.

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,480
Late Her Ladyship

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
used Biyu's younger sister

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
to threaten her.

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
She asked Biyu

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
to climb into His Lordship's bed

79
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,720
when he was drunk.

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
His Lordship didn't know what happened

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,680
until he woke up the next day.

82
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,440
He had no choice

83
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,080
but to take Biyu as his concubine.

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
So that's what happened.

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,160
No wonder Biyu wasn't favored.

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,120
It turns out His Lordship was forced.

87
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,400
That's why

88
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
His Lordship never

89
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,960
entered Biyu's room

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,680
again.

91
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,720
The plan of late Her Ladyship

92
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,830
ended up a debacle.

93
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,510
She blamed it on Biyu

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
and lambasted Biyu

95
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,760
from time to time.

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,480
Unexpectedly,

97
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,960
Biyu was so weak

98
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
that she couldn't stand jeers.

99
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,040
Jeers?

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,680
People jeered at her,
calling her shameless.

101
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,680
They said

102
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,000
she voluntarily climbed

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,760
into His Lordship's bed

104
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,080
to gain higher status

105
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
and met with rejection.

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,360
You know,

107
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,680
nobody can stand that kind of insult.

108
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,960
Besides, she was a weak person.

109
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,160
She couldn't get past herself.

110
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,680
So she hanged herself,

111
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,680
you know.

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,040
Biyu has been depressed

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,920
all that time.

114
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,080
But she didn't tell me anything.

115
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,360
Then again,

116
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
His Lordship

117
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
shouldn't have treated her so coldly.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
He should have shown his care for her.

119
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,680
She was his concubine,

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
after all.

121
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,000
If she

122
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,400
hadn't lost all hope,

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,640
she wouldn't have

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,200
committed suicide.

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
You're right.

126
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,040
But have you seen

127
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,360
His Lordship devote himself to anyone?

128
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
It's why

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
late Her Ladyship

130
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,160
decided to make Biyu

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,480
his concubine

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,880
to stay in his favor.

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,880
I don't think so.

134
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,600
His Lordship cares a lot

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,200
about Her Ladyship now.

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,360
He cares her for now.

137
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,680
But we don't know

138
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,200
what will happen in the future.

139
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,480
Enough talking.

140
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
Let's drink some more.

141
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,800
Nanny Tao,

142
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,720
get up and drink.

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,520
-Drink.
-Nanny Tao.

144
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,200
Truth be told,

145
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Luo Yuanniang and Xu Lingyi

146
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,600
forced Tong Biyu to kill herself.

147
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,640
We need Nanny Tao

148
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,440
to speak the truth

149
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,240
for Amber to believe it.

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,800
Once Amber learns the truth,

151
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,160
she'll make waves in the Xu family

152
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,480
out of loyalty to Her Ladyship,

153
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
which will facilitate your plan.

154
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Is that girl

155
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
capable of such a thing?

156
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,920
Don't underestimate her.

157
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,400
Her Ladyship trusts her very much.

158
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm pretty confident about this.

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Madam.

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
My elder sister...

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Late Her Ladyship and the Luo family

162
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,560
used me to push her.

163
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,360
Since His Lordship
took my sister as his concubine,

164
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,720
he shouldn't have ignored her

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,680
and cut her dead.

166
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,640
He allowed others to humiliate her.

167
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,200
The Luo family and His Lordship

168
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
forced my sister to kill herself.

169
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,600
Actually,

170
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,960
noble families like this one

171
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,640
may look glamorous,

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
but life is tough here

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,400
and outsiders would never understand.

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,920
Even Her Ladyship, as the legal wife

175
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,440
gets oppressed,

176
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
not to mention concubines,

177
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,440
maids and servants like us.

178
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,920
Madam,

179
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,080
thank you for letting me know

180
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,520
the truth.

181
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,840
I'll never forget

182
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,480
your kindness.

183
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,800
(Mansion of Xu)
Ou Yanxing has left Xianling Pavilion.

184
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,840
He won't be related to Xianling Pavilion

185
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,160
in any way from now on.

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
I hope you'll allow

187
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
Shiyi to stay

188
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,080
in Xianling Pavilion.

189
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,160
Ou Yanxing is Ou Yanxing.

190
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,760
Shiyi is Shiyi.

191
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
Maybe he left

192
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,880
for a hidden agenda.

193
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,960
Shiyi,

194
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,880
I hope you'll focus on the family

195
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,840
and perform a wife's duties

196
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,960
from now on.

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,360
Mother,

198
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,440
I don't think Xianling Pavilion

199
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,640
has stopped Shiyi

200
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
from being a competent matron.

201
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,560
It's been awhile
since Shiyi married into the family,

202
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,240
yet she has borne no child.

203
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,680
This fact alone is enough

204
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,160
to prove she is not competent.

205
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,320
Shiyi is young.

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,960
She'll bear a child sooner or later.

207
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,240
Since you're going out of
your way to defend her,

208
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,920
I'll say no more.

209
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,960
Shiyi can't take care of
you wholeheartedly

210
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,280
because she has other duties outside home

211
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,520
and Concubine Qin is the only woman

212
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,280
you have now.

213
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
That's far from sufficient.

214
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,120
I plan to find

215
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
another concubine for you.

216
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,320
Mother.

217
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
That won't do.

218
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,680
I'll find several candidates

219
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,000
for you

220
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,520
in a few days.

221
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,120
If you still think of me

222
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,480
as your mother,

223
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,520
don't say no.

224
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,400
Alright, I'm tired.

225
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,920
You may go.

226
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Don't worry.

227
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,040
No matter what,

228
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,560
I won't have a new concubine.

229
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
I know

230
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
your feelings for me.

231
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,560
But we can't

232
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,880
change Mother's mind.

233
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
I don't want

234
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,160
what Mother wants.

235
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
I know.

236
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,280
At the end of the day,

237
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,200
I'm just not doing well enough.

238
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,880
I'm not doing things perfectly.

239
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,120
You're doing well enough

240
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,200
in my eyes.

241
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
I only hope

242
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
you'll follow your heart.

243
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
Leave everything else to me.

244
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,280
Great Madam pressed on
Her Ladyship today.

245
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,320
I saw it

246
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,680
and it reminded me of my sister.

247
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
Although His Lordship

248
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,760
defended Her Ladyship today,

249
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,880
he did heartless things

250
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,760
to my sister.

251
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,800
Who knows if he'll abandon

252
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,240
Her Ladyship in the future?

253
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,360
It's very hard

254
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,200
to be a good matron

255
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,720
in the Xu family.

256
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,960
You lose freedom once you
marry into the noble family.

257
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,560
Yuanniang was heartless,

258
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,040
so is His Lordship.

259
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,600
They would stop at nothing
to attain their goals.

260
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,200
Her Ladyship is a good person.

261
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,080
But after she

262
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,640
married into the Xu family
with strict rules,

263
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,640
she couldn't find recognition

264
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,080
no matter how hard she tried.

265
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,880
Now Her Ladyship is getting
more and more depressed.

266
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm really worried

267
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
that she'll end up like my sister.

268
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,360
She is the legal wife of His Lordship, after all.

269
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
If she doesn't make any grave mistakes,

270
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,760
the Xu family won't

271
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
harm her.

272
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,480
To be honest,

273
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
I don't think life in the Xu family

274
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,480
suits her.

275
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,480
Madam,

276
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,440
what do you mean?

277
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
You see,

278
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,280
Her Ladyship's eyes sparkle

279
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,760
when she talks

280
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,440
about Xianling Pavilion.

281
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,600
She looks so happy.

282
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,600
Perhaps wealth and high status

283
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,560
have never mattered

284
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,480
to her.

285
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
She only seeks to live

286
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,760
as she wishes.

287
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,760
Amber.

288
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,280
You cried?

289
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
What happened?

290
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,800
Nothing.

291
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,240
I was merely worried

292
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,400
for Her Ladyship.

293
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,920
Worried about what?

294
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Were you worried

295
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
that His Lordship would
have a new concubine?

296
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,920
Don't worry.

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,280
His Lordship won't do that.

298
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
How do you know for sure?

299
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,360
If you liked a man

300
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,080
and your parents disapproved,

301
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,880
would you dare defy them?

302
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
If I had known this,

303
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,720
I'd have advised Her Ladyship

304
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,440
to sign the Divorce Agreement

305
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
and leave the Xu family.

306
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,000
Leave the Xu family?

307
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,600
You're oversimplifying the situation.

308
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
A divorced woman

309
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,360
is universally condemned.

310
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,680
The Luo family wouldn't take her back

311
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
if she were divorced.

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,560
How do you expect her

313
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,800
to spend the rest of her life?

314
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,800
Her Ladyship had nothing back then.

315
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
She'd rather run away from the marriage

316
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,720
than be confined to this house.

317
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,200
With Xianling Pavilion,

318
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,280
she is capable of standing on her own feet.

319
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Now the Xu family is pressing on her.

320
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,800
Divorce wouldn't have bothered

321
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,680
a woman of her personality.

322
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,080
That's nonsense.

323
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,840
Besides, His Lordship
treats her so well.

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,080
Why should she get a divorce?

325
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,880
Dongqing,

326
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
people change.

327
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,160
I don't think His Lordship will change.

328
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,160
His Lordship will definitely help her

329
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,520
overcome this crisis.

330
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,800
His Lordship. His Lordship.

331
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,480
You think

332
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,040
you truly know him?

333
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,040
And we're talking

334
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,240
about Her Ladyship here.

335
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,400
Why do you keep

336
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,560
mentioning His Lordship?

337
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,400
A married couple is a single unit.

338
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,120
When Her Ladyship is in trouble,

339
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,760
His Lordship

340
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,960
naturally enters my mind first.

341
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
I don't think so.

342
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,200
Dongqing,

343
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,200
there's something

344
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,720
that I must tell you.

345
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,280
I think

346
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,720
you admire and care about His Lordship

347
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,480
more than

348
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,800
a maid should.

349
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,840
What do you mean, Amber?

350
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm advising you

351
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,200
to analyze your mind

352
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,600
and understand your own feelings.

353
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,880
You're being so weird today.

354
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,080
I'm talking to you nicely.

355
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,720
But you keep making insinuations.

356
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,080
I'll stop talking to you.

357
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,960
You look so happy.

358
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,200
Did something good happen?

359
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,280
How is this?

360
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,720
Beautiful.

361
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,760
Do you plan to give this

362
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,800
to Dongqing?

363
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
How do you know?

364
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,440
I've known it

365
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,200
since I noticed you were

366
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,000
going after Dongqing all the time.

367
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,560
Smart-ass.

368
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
Is His Lordship here?

369
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,600
He is inside.

370
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
(I'll find several candidates)

371
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,920
(for you)

372
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,480
(in a few days.)

373
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,720
(If you still think of me)

374
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,110
(as your mother,)

375
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,200
(don't say no.)

376
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
My Lord.

377
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,720
I need to discuss something with you.

378
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,640
-I want to marry...
-I won't compromise

379
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,280
and have a new concubine.

380
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,280
But I can't defy Mother.

381
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,200
Is there any way to satisfy both me and her?

382
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
Great Madam Xu is right

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,560
to hire me.

384
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,400
I know most of the young ladies

385
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,720
in this city.

386
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,160
I'll find Marquis

387
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,600
a satisfactory concubine.

388
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,680
Her Ladyship treats me nicely.

389
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,360
I can't let her

390
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,680
go through this suffering.

391
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,000
If staying in the Xu family

392
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,440
means she must bear with this,

393
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,600
then wealth and high status don't matter.

394
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
She might as well...

395
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,440
She might as well leave.

396
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,440
Lower your voice.

397
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,440
Come here.

398
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,840
Look at you.

399
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,680
When you're antsy,

400
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,640
you talk about leaving.

401
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,640
It's not a small decision.

402
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,440
Her Ladyship always acts
reliably and cautiously.

403
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,000
She won't leave

404
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,800
this mansion easily.

405
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,440
But with the Xu family pressing on her,

406
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
she probably wants to leave.

407
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,960
Even if she

408
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
leaves the mansion

409
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,920
as you wish,

410
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,320
she won't be able to find a footing

411
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,040
in the capital anytime soon.

412
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
When she is wandering
around outside home

413
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,960
without the support of
her title and status,

414
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,680
who will she rely on?

415
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,400
Go.

416
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,320
Your Ladyship.

417
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,920
Great Madam treats you so badly

418
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,400
and you still make clothes for her.

419
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
What else can I do?

420
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,840
No matter what,

421
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,240
I should do my job.

422
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,360
Go now.

423
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,280
Your Ladyship.

424
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,800
Let me go,

425
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,560
so Dongqing can stay with you.

426
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,840
Alright.

427
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Amber, you can go.

428
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,400
If you went out with that sullen look

429
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,320
on your face, people might think

430
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
I punished you.

431
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
Your Ladyship.

432
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
Thank you for coming, Amber.

433
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,040
Great Madam has gone to bed.

434
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,880
You can stay for tea.

435
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
Thank you for the kind offer.

436
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
But I can't stay.

437
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,080
His Lordship lost two undergarments

438
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,960
recently.

439
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,200
I need to hurry up and find them,

440
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,680
so Her Ladyship won't feel anxious.

441
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,760
His Lordship lost some clothes?

442
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,800
Your place only

443
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
has a few people.

444
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,680
You are right.

445
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
Only Dongqing and I have access

446
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,640
to His Lordship's

447
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
undergarments.

448
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,560
I don't understand
how the clothes got lost.

449
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,800
Mrs. Du,

450
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,880
go about your day.

451
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,240
I won't bother you anymore.

452
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,880
Alright.

453
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,960
Great Madam,

454
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,360
Amber said

455
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,000
His Lordship lost

456
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,200
two undergarments.

457
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
I... I suspect...

458
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,840
Go on.

459
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,880
I suspect that Dongqing took the clothes.

460
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,000
She did?

461
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,960
Do you think

462
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,040
we should dismiss her?

463
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,720
If it is true,

464
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,480
maybe we can make good use of it.

465
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,960
Alright.

466
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,400
Go.

467
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,480
The embroidery on the belt

468
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,840
is really exquisite

469
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,760
and the stitching is unique.

470
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,400
I wonder

471
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,400
what kind of embroidery pattern

472
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,800
General Fu likes.

473
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,400
How about I embroider
an auspicious pattern?

474
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,120
Good luck and wish fulfillment.

475
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
I think he'll like it.

476
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,360
Search this place.

477
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,240
Yes.

478
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,600
Mrs. Du, what are you doing?

479
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
Dongqing.

480
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,520
What are you hiding?

481
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,520
Show me.

482
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,440
Nothing.

483
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm not hiding anything.

484
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,120
Isn't this His Lordship's belt?

485
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,640
Dongqing,

486
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,320
why did you keep

487
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
His Lordship's belt?

488
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,880
I...

489
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Can it be that you have

490
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,880
improper thoughts about His Lordship?

491
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,800
No, Mrs. Du!

492
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,520
Stop the nonsense.

493
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
Explain yourself to Great Madam.

494
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,680
Mrs. Du, it's not like that.

495
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Proof is here.

496
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,800
How dare you say

497
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
you don't have improper thoughts
about Lingyi?

498
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,600
Mother.

499
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,320
I made Dongqing handle

500
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
His Lordship's clothes.

501
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,800
Maybe this is a misunderstanding.

502
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,600
We should hear

503
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,000
from Dongqing first.

504
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,120
Alright.

505
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,360
Tell me

506
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
why you kept

507
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,080
Lingyi's belt.

508
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Great Madam,

509
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,840
I kept His Lordship's belt

510
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,760
to learn the stitches on it.

511
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
Learn the stitches?

512
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,440
Shiyi could have been
a great teacher for you,

513
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,320
but you didn't learn from her.

514
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,920
As an unmarried girl,

515
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,960
you kept a man's undergarment

516
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
and claimed you were
using it to learn stitches.

517
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,600
You think anyone

518
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,240
would believe you?

519
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
Great Madam,

520
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,760
I truly used it to learn stitches.

521
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,840
I wanted to make a...

522
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,600
Insolent maid!

523
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,160
How dare you make excuses?

524
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,360
You think the people you serve

525
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,480
are so easy to deceive?

526
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,920
Mother.

527
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,520
Dongqing has been serving me

528
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,880
since childhood.

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,640
I know her

530
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,720
the best.

531
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,680
She would never

532
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,360
have improper thoughts
about His Lordship.

533
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,760
You failed to keep her in check.

534
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,560
I haven't condemned you yet.

535
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,800
When this kind of thing happened,

536
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,920
how can I ever trust you again?

537
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,720
I'm wronged, Great Madam.

538
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,040
That belt is actually...

539
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,680
Dongqing.

540
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
You're the head maid of the matron,

541
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,840
yet you have the nerve
to covet the master.

542
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,760
According to the Xu family's rules,

543
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,960
you should be sold.

544
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,640
No, Great Madam.

545
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,400
Mother.

546
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,480
You are right.

547
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,040
I didn't discipline her strictly.

548
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,720
Please show mercy

549
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
and let Dongqing stay.

550
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,800
I'll discipline her strictly in the future.

551
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,320
Great Madam.

552
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,360
I beg of you to calm down.

553
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
Dongqing broke the family rules.

554
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,640
She should be sold.

555
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,080
But

556
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,320
Her Ladyship values Dongqing so much.

557
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,280
It'd hurt her if you sold Dongqing.

558
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,920
Let her stay,

559
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,320
and Her Ladyship
will be grateful to you.

560
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,280
You can find another way

561
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,360
to punish Dongqing.

562
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,200
Shiyi.

563
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,760
I know

564
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,320
Dongqing has served you

565
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,720
since childhood

566
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,200
and you don't have the heart to sell her.

567
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
Alright.

568
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,280
You all pleaded for her.

569
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,920
And I'm not

570
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,240
a heartless person.

571
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
Raise your head.

572
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,720
She has comely looks.

573
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
Now

574
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,520
I need to settle this matter

575
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,000
for the whole family.

576
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,280
Otherwise, nobody will obey

577
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,680
the Xu family's rules.

578
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,320
Shiyi.

579
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,640
You have three days to consider.

580
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,800
You either leave Xianling Pavilion

581
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,680
and help Lingyi
take Dongqing as his concubine

582
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,360
or

583
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,760
sell Dongqing

584
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,400
in accordance with the Xu family's rules.

585
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,800
Make a choice.

586
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,280
Great Madam,

587
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,840
this has nothing to do
with Her Ladyship.

588
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,440
Why are you pushing her?

589
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,040
I just...

590
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,640
Lock Dongqing up in the firewood room.

591
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,600
She won't leave the firewood room

592
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,680
without my permission,

593
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,880
unless she wants her legs broken.

594
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Servants,

595
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,160
take Dongqing to the firewood room.

596
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,840
(Nobody will believe me)

597
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,680
(no matter what I say now.)

598
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,720
Go.

599
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,640
Your Ladyship.

600
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,080
The food is getting cold.

601
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,920
Grab a bite.

602
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,720
Dongqing is trapped.

603
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,840
I have no appetite.

604
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,440
Great Madam

605
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,680
has pushed you

606
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,440
on every matter.

607
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,400
Now

608
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,120
she even threatened you with Dongqing.

609
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,440
She has gone too far.

610
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,040
Amber,

611
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,760
watch your mouth.

612
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
I can stay silent.

613
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,400
But it's true.

614
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,600
I never expected Dongqing

615
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,360
to have improper thoughts

616
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,200
about His Lordship.

617
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,880
Her thoughts have been used

618
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,280
against you.

619
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,880
I don't believe that Dongqing

620
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,680
has improper thoughts
about His Lordship.

621
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,680
If not,

622
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,360
why would she

623
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,200
keep His Lordship's belt?

624
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,960
Even if Dongqing made a mistake,

625
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
how did Great Madam learn of this?

626
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Something feels off to me.

627
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,400
Dongqing

628
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,040
has always been spoken.

629
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,440
It's possible

630
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,800
that someone saw through her

631
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,320
without her knowing it.

632
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,960
Anyway, I won't let Dongqing

633
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,320
be sold.

634
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,760
Your Ladyship,

635
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,880
don't worry too much.

636
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,800
This matter hasn't been settled.

637
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,480
Things still might take a favorable turn.

638
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,120
But this family has so many rules,

639
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,800
which depresses you.

640
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,120
Life in Xianling Pavilion

641
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,440
is much happier.

642
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,120
I can't believe

643
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,800
Great Madam used Dongqing

644
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,160
to push Her Ladyship.

645
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,440
Her Ladyship values Dongqing so much.

646
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,000
She can't bring herself to sell Dongqing.

647
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,760
I guess

648
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,440
Great Madam will get her way this time.

649
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,640
Not necessarily.

650
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,360
Her Ladyship is not the type of person

651
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,080
who would compromise easily.

652
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
But if she defies

653
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,000
Great Madam repeatedly,

654
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,440
the Xu family might not

655
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,440
tolerate her.

656
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,040
The Xu family might not tolerate her?

657
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,080
How do you know

658
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,040
it's not the other way around?

659
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,520
Alright. I'm tired.

660
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,520
You may go.

661
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,800
Yes.

662
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,840
(When I've turned His Lordship)

663
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,920
(and Her Ladyship against each other,)

664
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,240
(my plan will succeed)

665
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,480
(and my pain)

666
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
(will probably reduce.)

667
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,860
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

668
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,400
(You have three days to consider.)

669
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,480
(You either leave Xianling Pavilion)

670
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,400
(and help Lingyi
take Dongqing as his concubine)

671
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,440
(or sell Dongqing)

672
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,720
(in accordance with the Xu family's rules.)

673
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,080
(Make a choice.)

674
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,840
Don't worry.

675
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,760
Leave everything else to me.

676
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,560
What are you doing?

677
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,720
Please do me a favor.

678
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,440
Hurry up.

679
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,080
Thank you.

680
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,280
Amber.

681
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,600
Her Ladyship told me

682
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,560
to bring you food.

683
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,520
Eat it.

684
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,880
Her Ladyship

685
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,880
cares about me even now.

686
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,440
Amber.

687
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,400
Please explain things

688
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,840
to Her Ladyship for me.

689
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,840
I've never

690
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
loved His Lordship.

691
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,680
I...

692
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,040
I took his belt

693
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,920
to...

694
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,160
No matter what,

695
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,680
the fact is

696
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,280
you kept his personal items.

697
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,320
Time is limited.

698
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,720
Let's make this short.

699
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,800
Great Madam

700
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,760
is hell-bent

701
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,000
on using you to push Her Ladyship.

702
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,760
She won't let you off easily.

703
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,840
Explaining is useless

704
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,040
right now.

705
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,200
Her Ladyship has always
respected Great Madam.

706
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
Why is Great Madam

707
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,320
pushing Her Ladyship like this?

708
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,600
I'd rather they sell me

709
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,080
than let Her Ladyship

710
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,120
face the dilemma.

711
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,120
I actually came

712
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,960
to talk to you

713
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
about this.

714
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
This might

715
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,160
not be a bad thing.

716
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,120
What do you mean?

717
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,720
I saw Great Madam hire a matchmaker

718
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,680
to find His Lordship a concubine

719
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,640
a few days ago.

720
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,920
Great Madam is determined

721
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,160
to find His Lordship a concubine.

722
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,400
A man can't decline his elder's gift.

723
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,680
If Great Madam continues
to push His Lordship,

724
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,560
he won't neglect his filial duties

725
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,720
and disobey Great Madam.

726
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
What should I do then?

727
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
It's better to let His Lordship take you

728
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,190
as his concubine than another woman.

729
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,400
What are you blabbering about?

730
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,080
Sit down.

731
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,360
I'm not blabbering.

732
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,560
If His Lordship takes another woman
as his concubine,

733
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,360
she'll bring trouble

734
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,360
to Her Ladyship

735
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,560
whether His Lordship favors her or not.

736
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,190
Think about Qiao Lianfang

737
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
and Concubine Wen.

738
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,520
They brought a lot

739
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,000
of sufferings to Her Ladyship.

740
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,800
You are different.

741
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,920
If His Lordship takes you
as his concubine,

742
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
you won't compete with Her Ladyship

743
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,840
or harm Her Ladyship.

744
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,360
You're the best candidate

745
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,600
to be His Lordship's concubine.

746
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,280
You want me to be
His Lordship's concubine?

747
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,560
No, no.

748
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,840
His Lordship won't approve.

749
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,120
Her Ladyship won't approve either.

750
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,040
Her Ladyship is very fond of you.

751
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,120
Just tell her

752
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,880
you've loved His Lordship
for a long time.

753
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,600
She'll approve.

754
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,520
Once she approves,

755
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,200
His Lordship won't object.

756
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,920
Maybe Great Madam

757
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,040
will feel happy enough

758
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,880
to let Her Ladyship
return to Xianling Pavilion.

759
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,440
But I'm forever indebted
to Her Ladyship.

760
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,120
I can't do this

761
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
to betray her.

762
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,320
Dongqing,

763
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,800
how come you still don't understand?

764
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,000
You'll be helping Her Ladyship this way.

765
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,160
If His Lordship takes another woman

766
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,320
as his concubine,

767
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,960
Her Ladyship will face

768
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,560
more hardships.

769
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,000
(I'm sorry, Dongqing.)

770
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,880
(Your betrayal is the only thing)

771
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,920
(that can make Her Ladyship)

772
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,720
(weary of the life in this mansion.)

773
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,640
(It's the only way to make Her Ladyship)

774
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,120
(leave this troubled place.)

775
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,600
(I believe)

776
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,880
(you'll make the right decision)

777
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,480
(for Her Ladyship.)

778
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,240
(If I become His Lordship's concubine,)

779
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,120
(then General Fu...)

780
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,600
Open the door.

781
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,400
His Lordship sent me here

782
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,320
to ask Dongqing some questions.

783
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

784
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,360
General Fu.

785
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,920
Why are you here?

786
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,560
Yes.

787
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,200
Why am I here?

788
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,880
You've never

789
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,760
cared about me,

790
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,560
right?

791
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,040
What...what are you doing?

792
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,840
Let me go.

793
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,640
All this time,

794
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,400
you called me

795
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,200
General Fu

796
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,440
and never hesitated

797
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
to speak your mind.

798
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,320
You never did anything
to degrade yourself.

799
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,160
I saw you

800
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,560
as a pure-minded girl.

801
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,640
Then you got hurt.

802
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
You bled a lot.

803
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,480
I became anxious and worried.

804
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,200
And I realized what you meant to me.

805
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,880
I love you.

806
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,560
I...

807
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,000
I went out to buy this yesterday.

808
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,680
I had so many things to say.

809
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,000
I wanted to tell you

810
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,720
about all my feelings.

811
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
I wanted to marry you.

812
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,000
But I didn't know

813
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
you've been

814
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,680
loving His Lordship all this time.

815
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,040
If you don't love me,

816
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,880
why did you approach me?

817
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,200
No.

818
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,920
I've never loved His Lordship.

819
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,920
I've always...

820
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,320
(You are different.)

821
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,240
(If His Lordship takes you
as his concubine,)

822
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,480
(you won't compete with Her Ladyship)

823
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,240
(or harm Her Ladyship.)

824
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
You've never loved His Lordship?

825
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,080
Then why did you keep his belt?

826
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,800
You love His Lordship,

827
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,040
yet you've approached me.

828
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,040
What are you up to?

829
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,160
Do you consider me

830
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,080
your second choice

831
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,720
in case you can't marry His Lordship?

832
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,640
That's right.

833
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,360
I wanted to be His Lordship's concubine.

834
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,960
But he didn't like me.

835
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,600
So I had to settle for
the second-best option.

836
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,680
You can't compare with His Lordship,

837
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,520
but you're a high-ranking
official nonetheless.

838
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,440
You can give me

839
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,520
the wealth and high status I seek.

840
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,720
But now I have a chance

841
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,000
to be His Lordship's concubine.

842
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,160
I don't care about you anymore.

843
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,960
You greedy woman.

844
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,960
Yes.

845
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,680
I am

846
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,040
a greedy woman.

847
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,960
Forget me.

848
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,520
Fine.

849
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,320
Fine.

850
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,760
I judged you wrong.

851
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,680
Let's act as if we never met each other.

852
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,080
General Fu.

853
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,880
I was unfair to you.

854
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,240
But I had to break your heart

855
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,080
for Her Ladyship's sake.

856
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,720
Just forget me.
