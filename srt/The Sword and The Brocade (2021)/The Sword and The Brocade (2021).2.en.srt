00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,580
=Episode 2=

19
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,620
My Lord,

20
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,780
you have performed another great feat.

21
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,620
Has His Majesty rewarded you

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,060
with anything other than
the title of Imperial Tutor?

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,260
When His Majesty proposed to confer

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,820
one more title of nobility on me,
I turned him down.

25
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,140
It's getting late.

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,060
(Concubine Qin)
I won't disturb you,

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,460
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

28
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,620
I should leave.

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,500
I'll leave too.

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,540
I'll excuse myself, Father.

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,980
My Lord.

32
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,380
Why?

33
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,260
I asked His Majesty

34
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,380
to lift the sea ban

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,820
rather than confer
a title of nobility on me.

36
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,140
Unless the sea ban is lifted,

37
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,100
there will always be pirates

38
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,140
and the people won't

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,820
live in peace.

40
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,140
My Lord,

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,220
you always think
in the people's best interests.

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,260
But have you thought of me and Zhun?

43
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,300
You knew

44
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
I'd been hoping

45
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,620
you'd gain one more title of nobility.

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,180
Don't bring this up again.

47
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,700
Don't bring this up again?

48
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,460
Do you know

49
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,660
how hard my life is

50
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,620
as the wife of Marquis Yongping?

51
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,900
Stop.

52
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,140
Yuanniang,

53
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,660
you weren't like this back in the day.

54
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,540
Don't you know

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,500
why I became the person I am now?

56
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,380
Yuanniang.

57
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,700
Yuanniang.

58
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,740
Yuanniang.

59
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,500
Her miscarriage last year

60
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,020
caused a loss of energy and blood

61
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,300
and severe damage to her health.

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,940
She still hasn't recovered.

63
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,220
Now

64
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,100
all we can do is
help her survive on medicine.

65
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Thank you, Imperial Doctor.

66
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,060
Nanny Tao.

67
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,900
Yes.

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,380
This way, Imperial Doctor.

69
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,380
Let my second sister-in-law

70
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,580
and Dan Yang

71
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,580
help you with household affairs.

72
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,780
You think I'm too ill

73
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,020
to manage the household affairs?

74
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,660
Or do you think

75
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,620
I don't deserve

76
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,180
to be your wife?

77
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,380
You...

78
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,900
Have a good rest.

79
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,940
Your Ladyship.

80
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,620
Did you see that?

81
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,220
We just reunited after such a long time.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,340
But he didn't even

83
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,940
say anything nice to me.

84
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,180
Your Ladyship,

85
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,260
(Nanny Tao)

86
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,220
His Lordship is just distant in nature.

87
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,060
He still cares

88
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,780
about you.

89
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,740
Stop saying that

90
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,060
to console me.

91
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,620
His Lordship was born a cold person.

92
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,180
He expends all his energy

93
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,060
on defending our country

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,740
and bringing honor upon the Xu family.

95
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,180
I only hope Zhun

96
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,060
will be successful in the future.

97
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,700
Yu may be a concubine's son,

98
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,100
but he has been intelligent

99
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,340
and commended often.

100
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Meanwhile, Zhun is frail

101
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,300
due to his premature birth.

102
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,860
He makes slow progress on schoolwork.

103
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,220
If this goes on,

104
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm afraid Yu will
threaten Zhun's status

105
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,100
as heir of the Marquis.

106
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,700
Your Ladyship,

107
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,500
the Xu Family has always
differentiated your child

108
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,660
from the children of the concubines.

109
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,020
No matter how intelligent Yu is,

110
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,620
Great Madam

111
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,900
won't let Yu

112
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,340
steal Zhun's position.

113
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,060
Great Madam differentiates the children,

114
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,500
but His Lordship does not.

115
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,980
I was hoping he

116
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,820
would accept the reward and appease Yu,

117
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,580
so Zhun could inherit his title.

118
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,380
Now my hope is lost.

119
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,340
Everything will be fine while I'm alive.

120
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,940
But given my health condition...

121
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,060
I must secure Zhun's future

122
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,100
before I die.

123
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,060
(Zhaoying)

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,860
My Lord,

125
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,380
Her Ladyship has gone to bed.

126
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,340
I asked the doctor.

127
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,220
Her Ladyship's health

128
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,700
hasn't improved,

129
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,340
but has declined further

130
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,100
in recent days.

131
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,460
Has Imperial Physician Liu
diagnosed her?

132
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,020
Yes, he has.

133
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,860
The physician who has been
treating Her Ladyship

134
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,460
was recommended
by Imperial Physician Liu.

135
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,900
My Lord, let me replace
the dishes with heated ones.

136
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,340
No.

137
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,900
Remove the dishes.

138
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,140
(The Spring Banquet)
(Mansion of Xu)

139
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,020
Marquis Yongping's Mansion

140
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,860
was Princess Renhe's Mansion

141
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,220
during the previous emperor's reign.

142
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,340
After Princess Renhe passed away,

143
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,420
the mansion was rewarded

144
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,260
to the Xu Family.

145
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,220
Does this mean

146
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,620
our eldest sister lives
in an imperial house?

147
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,380
The previous emperor
loved Princess Renhe very much.

148
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,340
Ordinary imperial houses

149
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,060
can't compare

150
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,340
with this mansion.

151
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,140
She acts

152
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,860
as if she were

153
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,980
the wife of the Marquis.

154
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Madam Luo.

155
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,220
Madam Luo, you're finally here.

156
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
Her Ladyship is waiting for you.

157
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,100
Come with me
and meet your eldest sister.

158
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,020
Yes.

159
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,460
Wuniang,

160
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,260
is this the first time you've visited
our eldest sister's home?

161
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,820
Mother took Erniang here a few times.

162
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,260
This is the first time I've been here.

163
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,060
This way, Madam Luo.

164
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,380
These square stone lampposts

165
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,620
can't be found in ordinary mansions.

166
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,660
Marquis Yongping's Mansion
is no common house.

167
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,460
It's not worth fussing about.

168
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,780
Wuniang, Shiyi,

169
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,260
when you see our eldest sister

170
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,540
and she rewards you,

171
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,420
just accept it gracefully.

172
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,900
Don't try to decline.

173
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,540
Don't stoop or lower your head.

174
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,620
Don't panic or fluster.

175
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,460
Don't look around

176
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,380
or have any wild thoughts.

177
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,860
Erniang, Mother is here.

178
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,540
You don't have to teach us that.

179
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,500
Mother,

180
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,580
I didn't mean to assume your duty.

181
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,340
I'm just worried

182
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,660
that they'll forget their manners

183
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,820
on their first trip here.

184
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,540
Erniang is right.

185
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,300
Today is the third day of March

186
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,620
and the Xu Family is going to
hold the spring banquet.

187
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,500
The noble Xu Family

188
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,860
has a great many guests.

189
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,180
Since this is your first trip here,

190
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,420
you must stay alert.

191
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,220
Don't make a fool of yourselves

192
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,380
or bring shame upon the Luo Family

193
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,860
and your eldest sister.

194
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,700
Yes.

195
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,820
Madam Luo.

196
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,180
Her Ladyship is in the room.

197
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,060
After you.

198
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,220
Mother, you're here.

199
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,340
Yuanniang.

200
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,860
Have no worry. I'm here.

201
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,860
Greetings, Yuanniang.

202
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,020
So many years

203
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,660
have passed in the blink of an eye.

204
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,780
The little girls

205
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,660
who followed me around

206
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,020
have grown

207
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,180
into beautiful young women.

208
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,460
Yuanniang,

209
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,700
I got this protective talisman

210
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,500
for you at Ci'an Temple.

211
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,740
I'm sure

212
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,700
it'll help you recover soon.

213
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,900
The floor is cold.

214
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,420
Get up.

215
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,140
You're a grown-up now.

216
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,340
How come you still cry easily

217
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,060
like you used to do?

218
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,940
Erniang, you're so thoughtful.

219
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,380
You must be Shiyi.

220
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,540
Greetings, Yuanniang.

221
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,820
We haven't seen each other for years.

222
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,660
You have changed so much.

223
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,540
You're much prettier now.

224
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,060
Nanny Tao.

225
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,060
I didn't know

226
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,660
what you like.

227
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,140
But I remembered having

228
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,660
three presentable jade pendants,

229
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,980
so I had my servants find them.

230
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,500
Each of you can take one jade pendant.

231
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,220
Thank you.

232
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,260
Pick one.

233
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,340
Go pick one.

234
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,100
This is a gift

235
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,500
from your eldest sister.

236
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,380
Wuniang, you can pick first.

237
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,260
Erniang, you should pick first.

238
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,140
Then I'd better respect your wish.

239
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,940
(Joy)

240
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,540
"Joy".

241
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,340
It's a good sign.

242
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,260
You should start picking.

243
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,300
(Fertility and Luck)

244
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,700
Wuniang, what did you pick?

245
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,140
The one that reads "good fortune".

246
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,940
Then Shiyi

247
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,460
must have picked the one
that reads "fertility and luck".

248
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,980
Fertility and luck.

249
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,340
That's good fortune.

250
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,700
Thank you.

251
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,740
I love it.

252
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Thank you.

253
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,060
Good to know you love the pendants.

254
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,100
You may leave.

255
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,980
Your eldest sister and I

256
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,820
need some privacy to talk.

257
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,340
-Yes.
-Yes.

258
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,500
What do you think?

259
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,300
Erniang probably knows

260
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,100
I'm looking for a person
to take care of Zhun.

261
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,460
And she has guessed that I don't want

262
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,780
that person to be fertile and lucky.

263
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,380
So she put on that act.

264
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,900
But it was just a petty trick.

265
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,420
As for Shiyi,

266
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,740
I can't tell

267
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,940
her character yet.

268
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,500
Let's wait and see.

269
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,540
Wuniang,

270
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,180
our eldest sister's illness...

271
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,500
I've always known

272
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,900
about her poor health.

273
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,460
But when I saw her earlier today,

274
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,180
I realized she was sicker
than I'd thought.

275
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,740
I wonder what kind of disease it is

276
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,500
that ails her so much.

277
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,420
Don't worry.

278
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,100
The Xu Family will find

279
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,580
the best doctor for her.

280
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,740
By the way, Erniang has behaved

281
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,300
strangely earlier today.

282
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,060
She has always

283
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,620
been competitive.

284
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,580
Why did she pick

285
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,260
the jade pendant that read "joy"?

286
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,220
Is my "good fortune" not good enough?

287
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,940
Or is "fertility and luck" not desirable?

288
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,420
Fertility and luck.

289
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,980
My Lord,

290
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,620
(Qiao Lianfang)
Liu Yong didn't return to Dongnan.

291
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,060
It seems...

292
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,300
Did he enter the capital?

293
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,260
We have no concrete evidence.

294
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,300
But there are signs

295
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,100
of him heading to the capital.

296
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,500
How do you know?

297
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,580
If none of the officials
had colluded with the pirates,

298
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,740
Jiang Huai and Liu Yong

299
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,460
wouldn't have escaped from my camp.

300
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,940
Since Liu Yong isn't going to Dongnan,

301
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,060
he must be heading
to the capital to seek help.

302
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,340
Then I arrange for troops

303
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,500
to lie in ambush at the Nine Gates.

304
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,340
Once he appears,

305
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
we'll catch him.

306
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,180
We should track him

307
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,500
rather than catch him
and alert his accomplices.

308
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,660
Marquis.

309
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,940
Lianfang.

310
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
What are you doing here?

311
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,940
My Lord,

312
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,540
I'll excuse myself.

313
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,460
My Lord,

314
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,740
I'll prepare toiletries.

315
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,860
Lianfang,

316
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,260
the guests are in the drawing room.

317
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,620
Did you take the wrong path?

318
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,660
I'll order my servants to lead you back.

319
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,540
Thank you for your concern.

320
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,180
I didn't take the wrong path.

321
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,980
I heard from my aunt

322
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,820
the apricot blossoms
were blooming in the yard.

323
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,580
So I wanted to come and feel

324
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,980
the vibrant air of spring
around the apricots.

325
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,420
Then I won't disturb you.

326
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,860
Marquis.

327
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,620
I...

328
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,500
Are you alright?

329
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,180
I'm sorry, Marquis.

330
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,540
I was being reckless.

331
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,020
I have things to do.

332
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,900
Excuse me.

333
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,700
I went to the temple
to get a protective talisman,

334
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,300
but I forgot to give it to him.

335
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,420
Was that our brother-in-law?

336
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,460
Only our brother-in-law

337
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,780
is addressed as "Marquis"

338
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,340
in Marquis Yongping's Mansion.

339
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,540
I thought he only had two concubines.

340
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,700
Who was the girl

341
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,780
throwing herself at him?

342
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,260
His wife is bed-ridden,

343
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,100
yet he is

344
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,020
intimate with other woman.

345
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,060
It seems Marquis Yongping

346
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,460
is not a righteous man.

347
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,060
-Let's go.
-Go.

348
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,100
Your father's mourning period

349
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,340
came to an end recently.

350
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,220
He was going to resume his position,

351
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,540
but his teacher Grand Secretary Liu

352
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,140
retired and returned

353
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,100
to his hometown.

354
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,220
Now that he is gone,

355
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,020
he can't support your father anymore.

356
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
Your father will have a hard time

357
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,980
at the court.

358
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,140
We must not wait any longer.

359
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,500
We must choose one of my younger sisters

360
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,980
for His Lordship to marry

361
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,060
after I pass away.

362
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,300
Yuanniang.

363
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,300
Mother,

364
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,940
if I am gone,

365
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,140
will the Xu Family
still treat the Luo Family

366
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,860
as their relatives?

367
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,420
Father has lost

368
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,100
Grand Secretary Liu's support.

369
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,100
If we lose the Xu Family's support,

370
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,780
he'll never resume his position.

371
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,220
When Zhun

372
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,020
loses his mother's protection

373
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,780
and the Luo Family loses its power,

374
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,780
Zhun will no longer

375
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,380
have his most reliable backer's help.

376
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,020
He might lose

377
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,580
his heir status of the Marquis.

378
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,060
We must plan ahead.

379
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,260
Your younger sister Wuniang

380
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,780
is already engaged.

381
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,460
And your younger sister Erniang

382
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,700
is clever, but she is incapable

383
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,380
of anything great as you said.

384
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,820
She'll need the Luo Family

385
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,220
to help her gain a foothold
in the Xu Family.

386
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,980
People like her

387
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,420
have an axe to grind.

388
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,900
But she won't dare

389
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,260
to act against Zhun's interests.

390
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,660
I think

391
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,700
she qualifies as
the Marquis' second wife.

392
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,340
You don't think Shiyi qualifies?

393
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,380
Shiyi has always been

394
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,500
strong-minded

395
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,020
and she won't be controlled easily.

396
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,500
You mean

397
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,820
Erniang should marry His Lordship

398
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,220
and Shiyi should marry
into the Wang Family?

399
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,740
Young Madam Jiang

400
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,740
is the eldest daughter of Wang Family.

401
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,620
Her younger brother Wang Yu is infamous.

402
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,180
Finding a wife for him
has been difficult.

403
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,940
By marrying Shiyi into the Wang Family,

404
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,940
we secure a marriage between Zhun

405
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,140
and a lady of the Jiang Family.

406
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,100
Once he marries a lady
of the Jiang Family,

407
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,060
he'll be able to rely

408
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,180
on his powerful relatives.

409
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,620
No matter which one of my
younger sisters marries His Lordship,

410
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,660
Qiao Lianfang will

411
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,940
stand as the biggest hindrance.

412
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,180
You are here.

413
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,980
Great Madam.

414
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,100
We have many guests today.

415
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,180
I hope you'll forgive me

416
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,500
if you ever find
the reception unsatisfactory.

417
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,380
(Madam Qiao)
You're too kind.

418
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,780
But I'm not an outsider.

419
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,140
You don't have to be formal with me.

420
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,940
You are right.

421
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,980
Where is Lianfang?

422
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,300
Why isn't she here?

423
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,660
Great Madam.

424
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,540
Great Madam.

425
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,220
Pardon me for arriving late.

426
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,420
You are not late.

427
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,260
I'm honored

428
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,140
that you came.

429
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,020
Come here.

430
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,020
Meet them.

431
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,380
This is my cousin,

432
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,620
the third concubine of Duke Cheng.

433
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,500
She has brought

434
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,860
her daughter Lianfang here.

435
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,900
Coincidentally,

436
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,780
Lianfang is at the same age

437
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,300
as your daughters.

438
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,060
Are you talking about me, Aunt?

439
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,180
Look.

440
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,300
Speak of the devil.

441
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,540
Greetings, Great Madam.

442
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,460
Come here.

443
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Lianfang,

444
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,820
I invited your favorite

445
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,660
Huayin Troupe here.

446
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,820
You can ask them to perform

447
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,820
whatever opera you want to watch.

448
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,460
Thank you for your kind gesture.

449
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,100
Aunt,

450
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,580
you look fabulous

451
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,180
today.

452
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,180
Is your headache getting better?

453
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,300
I'm glad that you care about me.

454
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,980
I followed the prescription

455
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,500
you gave me the other day.

456
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,540
Finally,

457
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,220
I had a few nights of sound sleep.

458
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,940
You have no idea

459
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,700
how much trouble she went through

460
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,500
for the folk prescription.

461
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,780
These are

462
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,660
my daughters.

463
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,260
Greet the Madams.

464
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,700
Greetings, Madams.

465
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,700
Look

466
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,660
how pleasing these girls are.

467
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,860
Madam Luo,

468
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,020
you're so lucky.

469
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,620
I used to be proud

470
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,940
of my daughters.

471
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,100
But after I saw young ladies
of various families,

472
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,980
I learned what real highborn ladies
look like.

473
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,860
You girls

474
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,980
should learn from them.

475
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,580
-Yes.
-Yes.

476
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,060
Don't be so modest.

477
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,220
I think

478
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,900
your girls are good.

479
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,860
They are just as cultured as Yuanniang.

480
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,580
Alright.

481
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,020
Enjoy your stay

482
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,740
here.

483
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,140
I'll greet the guests at Dianchun Hall.

484
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,860
Take a seat.

485
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,980
Lady Qiao.

486
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,620
Is my makeup messed up

487
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,860
or is there something wrong
with my outfit?

488
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,620
Why are you staring at me like that?

489
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,060
No reason.

490
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
I'm just looking around.

491
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,060
This is the hairpin rewarded to us

492
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,300
by the Noble Consort.

493
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,340
Wear it properly.

494
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,620
You must be Madam Luo.

495
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,580
Young Madam Jiang.

496
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,620
(Young Madam Jiang?)

497
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
(She is the elder sister
of Wang Yu the playboy.)

498
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,660
(Is she here to see us?)

499
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,860
Come on.

500
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,660
Let's see

501
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,140
if my cousin needs anything.

502
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,260
Madam Luo,

503
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,820
Yuanniang and I are as close as sisters.

504
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,900
We should

505
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,940
communicate more in the future.

506
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,140
You're too kind, Young Madam Jiang.

507
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,820
This is Young Madam

508
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,060
of the Jiang Family in Le'an.

509
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,500
Young Madam Jiang.

510
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,300
The Luo Family has distinct young ladies.

511
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,860
Every one of them is
talented and beautiful.

512
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,580
I wouldn't go as far as
to call them talented and beautiful.

513
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,540

515
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,740
Your handkerchief is exquisite.

516
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,700
Did you make the embroidery yourself?

517
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
Madam,

518
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,100
although I embroidered the handkerchief,

519
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,100
I am no match

520
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,060
for my younger sister Shiyi

521
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,540
in terms of embroidery.

522
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,620
Her embroidery works

523
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,020
are vivid

524
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,260
and ingenious.

525
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,540
Am I right, Wuniang?

526
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,540
Everyone who has seen
Shiyi's embroidery works

527
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,700
has commended her.

528
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,820
This handkerchief

529
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,540
was embroidered by Shiyi.

530
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,140
Have a look, Madam.

531
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,260
It really shows extraordinary skills.

532
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,460
Shiyi is truly skillful.

533
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,500
Thank you, Young Madam Jiang.

534
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,300
You're too modest.

535
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,940
My embroidery skills

536
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,620
is the only presentable things about me.

537
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,420
I'm in no way

538
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,900
as kind and elegant as you.

539
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Your girls are cultured,

540
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,300
beautiful and intelligent.

541
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,060
You must have raised them well.

542
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,260
You're so lucky.

543
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,500
Madams and ladies,

544
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,900
the stage has been set.

545
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,140
Come along, please.

546
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,900
Yuanniang

547
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,500
only has a few months to live.

548
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,860
Your aunt and I

549
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,460
have talked in private.

550
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,420
Your aunt wants you to
marry into the Xu Family too.

551
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,220
No matter what certain people do,

552
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:09,980
they are nothing more

553
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
than incompetent clowns.

554
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,940
The others are nothing to worry about.

555
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,100
But the young ladies
of the Luo Family...

556
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,780
I'm afraid that Luo Yuanniang

557
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,340
has got her own plan.

558
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
They are the humble daughters
of the concubines.

559
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,660
My cousin and the Marquis

560
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,980
would never take a liking to them.

561
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,460
Look at you.

562
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,100
My daughter

563
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,820
looks prettier than anyone when smiles.

564
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,380
Rest at ease.

565
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,860
(Xu Lingkuan)

566
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,740
I was wondering

567
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,100
when Lingkuan

568
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,180
became the head of Huayin Troupe.

569
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,220
I heard that you came.

570
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,220
So I learned how to do this.

571
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Do you want

572
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,220
to watch an opera with
a focus on singing and acting

573
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,940
or an opera with a focus on combat moves?

574
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,700
He is the Marquis' younger brother

575
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,460
Xu Lingkuan of the Xu Family.

576
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,340
How about I

577
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,940
recite the opera titles for you?

578
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,820
Lingkuan, stop clowning around.

579
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,780
You might scare

580
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,500
the young ladies.

581
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,380
(Danyang)
Danyang is here.

582
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,300
Come on.

583
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,020
Hold Lingkuan in check.

584
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,020
Mom.

585
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,860
Lingkuan was only being kind.

586
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,300
So many elders

587
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,540
and young ladies are here.

588
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,020
We can't let the opera actors

589
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,460
come in and present the list of operas.

590
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,460
Alright.

591
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,740
Greet the Madams.

592
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,940
Let's watch an opera with
a focus on singing and acting.

593
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,660
The operas with a focus on combat moves

594
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,620
are all about fighting

595
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
and actors doing somersaults.

596
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,900
You watch them till the end,

597
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,900
but you don't understand

598
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,900
what's going on.

599
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,020
Then we'll watch "The Peony Pavilion".

600
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,140
I like that.

601
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,820
Alright.

602
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,220
I'll make preparations.

603
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,900
Yes.

604

00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,420
I'm sorry, Lady Qiao.

687
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,620
I was in a hurry.

688
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,980
Let me wipe it clean.

689
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,660
No need.

690
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,140
Get up.

691
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,540
Thank you, Lady Qiao.

692
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,700
Lady Qiao,

693
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,180
come to the courtyard with me

694
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,380
if you don't mind.

695
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,060
You can get your clothes cleaned

696
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,220
as soon as possible there.

697
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,620
The courtyard?

698
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,100
(Maybe I'll run into
the Marquis in the courtyard.)

699
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,260
I guess I have no choice.

700
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,980
Lady Qiao, this way.

701
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,580
Lady Qiao, this way.

702
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
(Jing'an Pavilion)

703
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,300
This is the place, Lady Qiao.

704
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,700
I stayed indoors for too long.

705
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,140
So I wanted to come out for a walk.

706
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,340
I hope you don't mind, Shiyi.

707
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,060
Lady Qiao.

708
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,820
Wait here for a while, please.

709
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,740
Let me bring you

710
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,740
some clean clothes,

711
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,900
so you won't catch a cold.

712
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,060
But...

713
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Don't worry.

714
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,740
Nobody will come here.

715
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,100
Alright.

716
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,140
Shiyi.

717
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,340
Where do you live at the family house?

718
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,820
Yuanniang,

719
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,020
I live in Lvyun Suite.

720
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,900
I remember that it has a warm room.

721
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,660
The warm room

722
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,300
is bright and cozy.

723
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,620
I often read in the warm room

724
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,820
when I was a kid.

725
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Are you tired?

726
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,620
How about we

727
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,140
find a place to rest?

728
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,580
Jing'an Pavilion is just
a stone's throw away.

729
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,940
Let's rest there.

730
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,580
Alright.

731
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,820
This way.
