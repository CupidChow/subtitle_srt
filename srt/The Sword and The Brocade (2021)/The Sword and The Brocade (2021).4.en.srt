19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,020
Why did Wang Family suddenly

20
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,540
change their mind?

21
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,900
Didn't they say

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,540
they wanted Erniang

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,300
to marry into their family?

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Who knows?

25
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,460
Madam Jiang

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,340
visited us all of a sudden yesterday

27
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,140
and said they wanted Shiyi instead.

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,860
I told them I'd think about it.

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,060
But they seemed to be very determined

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,460
about marrying Shiyi,

31
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,780
saying they'd agree to any terms

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,900
as long as Shiyi

33
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,180
is willing to marry.

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,940
No matter who marries into Wang Family,

35
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,460
it'd be a great effort made
for Zhun's marriage.

36
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,700
It's just that Shiyi

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,900
has been involved that day.

38
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,620
I'm afraid...

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,820
I think it's actually better.

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Shiyi is an independent-minded woman,

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,900
who is hard to control.

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,420
We may as well just marry Shiyi

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,900
off to Wang Family as they want.

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,860
As for what happened that day,

45
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,780
as long as Concubine Lv is in my hands,

46
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,420
I'm sure she'll keep quiet.

47
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,700
Fine.

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,340
At the moment, Zhun's marriage

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,740
matters the most.

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,980
If we lose the support of the Jiangs,

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,500
it'd be no use no matter

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,700
which sister marries into our family.

53
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,220
Erniang has been

54
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,740
sending over some

55
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,580
small gadgets lately.

56
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,700
Zhun likes them a lot.

57
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,180
I guess it's destiny.

58
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,740
Then it's settled.

59
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,900
My Lord!

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,180
Qingtong.

61
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,700
My Lord!

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,340
What are you doing?

63
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,500
-Rise!
-My Lord!

64
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,820
My Lord!

65
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,940
My Lord! I'm begging you!

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,700
Please don't!

67
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,860
Please don't marry Shiyi

68
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,540
off to that Wang Yu!

69
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,100
All the people in the capital

70
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,940
know what kind person

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,620
he is, My Lord!

72
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,940
If Shiyi marries him,

73
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,620
she'll live in utter misery!

74
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,540
My Lord!

75
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,540
I don't want her

76
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,900
to marry Wang Yu either.

77
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,700
But this marriage matters

78
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,700
to the fortune of our entire Luo Family

79
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,100
and Marquis Yongping's Mansion,

80
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,780
we can't just cancel it.

81
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,980
My Lord,

82
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,300
I've gone through

83
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,700
all the hardships

84
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,340
in Yuhang

85
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,540
for the last three years.

86
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,700
But, My Lord,

87
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,980
Shiyi is

88
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,020
your daughter for God's sake!

89
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,740
Will you just sit back and watch

90
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,620
her life being destroyed?

91
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,460
My Lord! Please!

92
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,380
For

93
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,180
old times' sake,

94
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,180
please help Shiyi, My Lord!

95
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,260
My Lord, I'm begging you!

96
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,580
My Lord!

97
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,340
My Lord, I'm begging you!

98
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm begging you!

99
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,060
I'll go discuss it

100
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,780
with my wife.

101
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Rise! Please rise!

102
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,580
Come on! Rise!

103
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,620
My Lord, you are back.

104
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,980
My Lady.

105
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,620
Sit down.

106
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,180
My Lady,

107
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,340
I think

108
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,940
we should cancel
the marriage arrangement

109
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,500
with Duke Mao's Mansion.

110
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,620
My Lord,

111
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,100
the future of Zhun

112
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,860
and Luo Family

113
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,580
all depends

114
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,780
on this marriage.

115
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,780
How can we cancel it?

116
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,780
But that Wang Yu

117
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
is an infamous playboy.

118
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,660
He... he's not only a frequenter

119
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,660
of those entertainment venues,

120
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,940
but also a ruthless

121
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,100
and cruel bully!

122
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,820
How can you push my daughter

123
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,500
into an abyss of pain?

124
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,100
Abyss of pain?

125
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,380
All my dowries have been used

126
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,380
to help out our family these years!

127
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,100
I can't believe
you still don't trust me!

128
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,340
I didn't

129
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,740
mean that.

130
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,700
I just...

131
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,100
My Lord,

132
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,500
as a concubine's daughter,

133
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,940
it's a bliss for her that she can

134
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,460
marry into Wang Family and become

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,500
the wife of Duke Mao!

136
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,580
It's a great bliss!

137
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,380
It makes sense,

138
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,140
and I know

139
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,660
you are thinking of Zhun

140
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,300
and our Luo Family.

141
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,940
But my daughter isn't willing to marry.

142
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,380
As her father,

143
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,980
how can I force her to do it?

144
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,660
Marriage should

145
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,180
be arranged by parents

146
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,580
and matchmakers.

147
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,100
It's not up to the children.

148
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,900
My Lord, no worries!

149
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,340
I will

150
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,180
convince her to get on
that sedan willingly.

151
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,580
Fine.

152
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,740
Shiyi,

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,940
don't worry too much.

154
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,460
I've begged your father.

155
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,180
After all you are his daughter,

156
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,180
he won't let you

157
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,020
marry that Wang Yu.

158
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,020
Mom,

159
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,740
don't you remember

160
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,300
that we were sent to Yuhang

161
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,780
right after you had a miscarriage.

162
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,860
Although my father cared about us,

163
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,700
he still had to listen

164
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,740
to his wife.

165
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,820
Now that this marriage matters
to the interests of our family,

166
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,860
it won't be a big deal

167
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,820
for him

168
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,060
to sacrifice his concubine's daughter.

169
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,020
And I heard that ever since His Lordship

170
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,740
came back home for mourning,

171
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,020
our family has been using

172
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,820
his wife's dowries for expenses.

173
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm afraid that His Lordship

174
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,460
can't call the shots now.

175
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,820
Take both of them down!

176
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,300
What?

177
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,580
What? What's...

178
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,220
Your Ladyship!

179
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,500
Your Ladyship! What's going on?

180
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,060
Mother,

181
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,220
have we done anything wrong?

182
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,100
You should recognize this, right?

183
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,900
My Lady!

184
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,060
Shiyi,

185
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,340
how dare you

186
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,420
secretly sell the embroideries?

187
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,180
Hasn't our Luo Family

188
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,660
provided you enough food and clothes?

189
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,900
Your Ladyship,

190
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,620
we'd never dare do that!

191
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,140
It...

192
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,780
it's probably a misunderstanding!

193
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,660
Misunderstanding?

194
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,060
The embroideries were retrieved

195
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,020
from Xianling Pavilion.

196
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,340
It can't be a mistake!

197
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,820
Mother, I think it's a misunderstanding.

198
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,900
Master Jian of Xianling Pavilion

199
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,340
is my teacher.

200
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,860
I just wanted to show
her the embroideries

201
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,500
to get her instructions.

202
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,620
Fine.

203
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,900
I'll call Master Jian over

204
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,260
and ask her!

205
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,460
Your Ladyship!

206
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,860
Your Ladyship!

207
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,580
I should be held accountable for this!

208
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,060
It's my fault!

209
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,140
It's me...

210
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,940
It's me who saw

211
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,580
Shiyi's exquisite works

212
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,940
and asked her to sell them for money!

213
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,180
I was being greedy.

214
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,700
Please punish me!

215
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,500
No! It's not true!

216
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,660
It's all my fault!

217
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,500
I'm the one who stole

218
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,300
Lady Shiyi's embroideries

219
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,060
and sold them for money!

220
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,940
Your Ladyship, you should punish me!

221
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,900
What nonsense are you talking about?

222
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,740
Since you've all admitted it,

223
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,820
Fine!

224
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,940
Guards,

225
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,180
flog each of them 20 times!

226
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,540
Mother!

227
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
Nanny Xu.

228
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,580
Yes!

229
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,900
Count carefully!

230
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,620
Yes!

231
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,300
One!

232
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,260
Mom!

233
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,500
Mother, it's my bad!

234
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,580
I'm the one who sold the embroideries!

235
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,020
They have nothing to do with it!

236
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,060
Two!

237
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,300
Shiyi,

238
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,180
you didn't do anything wrong.

239
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,700
How can I punish you?

240
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,860
I was wrong!

241
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,220
It's really my fault!

242
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,020
Please punish me instead!

243
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,940
Three!

244
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,700
Shiyi,

245
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,660
as your mother, I have

246
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,020
to teach you a lesson today.

247
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,460
Nothing can be done without rules.

248
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,740
Four!

249
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,380
In our Luo Family,

250
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,260
I'm the one who sets the rules!

251
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,700
Five!

252
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,740
Six!

253
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,580
Mother!

254
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,300
I know I made a mistake!

255
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,540
From now on,

256
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,340
I will behave myself

257
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,340
and I'll never break the rules again!

258
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,860
Shiyi,

259
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,500
I know you are a sensible person.

260
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,380
Then I'll let it go today.

261
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,180
If it happens again,

262
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,140
I won't let you off so easily!

263
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,180
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

264
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Sir.

265
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,700
It's burning hot!

266
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,620
You are so clumsy!

267
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,900
Get out of here!

268
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,660
Yes.

269
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,500
Mother, Luo Family has really agreed!

270
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,660
Of course!

271
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,300
Have I ever lied to you?

272
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,820
It's great!

273
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,300
You didn't let me down indeed!

274
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,380
You love me so much!

275
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,500
But I don't understand

276
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,060
why do you insist

277
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,620
on marrying Luo Shiyi?

278
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,620
Based on your sister,

279
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,740
Erniang is witty and smart;

280
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,460
she's the most outstanding one

281
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,820
among all her sisters.

282
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,140
What would my sister know?

283
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,020
Alright.

284
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,980
Why are you leaving?

285
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,900
You won't eat anymore?

286
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,340
I'll marry a beauty soon! I'm full!

287
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,460
Ridiculous! This kid!

288
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,980
Mom,

289
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,140
you are seriously injured.

290
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,020
Do not move!

291
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,300
I was just flogged six times.

292
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,980
I'll be better

293
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,580
after applying medicine.

294
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,540
By the way, how's Dongqing?

295
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,500
I've applied medicine for her

296
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,540
and let her rest.

297
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,340
Dongqing is such

298
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,420
a loyal maid.

299
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,300
You've been treating her
like your younger sister.

300
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,860
It's really paid off.

301
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,980
Mother, it's my bad!

302
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,860
I wasn't cautious enough

303
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,700
and let Her Ladyship find out.

304
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,020
Sorry I made you suffer!

305
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,580
My daughter,

306
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,540
don't be silly.

307
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,740
I'm the one

308
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,100
who brought trouble to you.

309
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,900
Her Ladyship

310
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,180
knows that I'm

311
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,220
your weakness,

312
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,620
that's why she used me against you.

313
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,820
I feel sorry that I'm so useless

314
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,860
that I can't be of any help.

315
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,180
But, Shiyi,

316
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,900
I've thought about it.

317
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,260
I can't let you marry off

318
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,780
to Wang Family whatsoever!

319
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,180
Tomorrow morning,

320
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,500
I'll go to Duke Mao's Mansion

321
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,740
and talk to Madam Wang.

322
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,460
I'll tell her

323
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,620
that you've been suffering from a

324
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,100
coughing problem since you were little.

325
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,620
Maybe it'll make her change her mind.

326
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,020
But I'm also worried

327
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,780
that it'd make it difficult

328
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,780
for you to get married

329
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,780
in the future.

330
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,700
Mom,

331
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,780
you always put me first.

332
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,420
What about yourself?

333
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,500
If you ruin Her Ladyship's plan,

334
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,300
she'll never forgive you!

335
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,500
Kid,

336
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,220
as long as you are well and happy,

337
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
I'd love to do anything.

338
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,740
It's okay.

339
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,300
Don't worry.

340
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,220
I'll figure out something.

341
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,060
Stop worrying.

342
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,140
It'll be fine.

343
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,700
Mom,

344
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,100
let's leave here!

345
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,100
Let's leave on the 1st of next month!

346
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,580
We'll never come back again!

347
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,020
Well...

348
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,380
Mother, don't move!

349
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,500
What are you talking about?

350
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,820
You want to run away from your wedding?

351
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,820
Listen, kid!

352
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,060
You can't do that!

353
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:10,940
But...

354
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,620
how come you've never

355
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,820
mentioned that before?

356
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,980
I was worried that you'd object,

357
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,620
so I dared not tell you.

358
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,020
No! You can't do that, kid!

359
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,420
If... If you were caught

360
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,500
by Her Ladyship,

361
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
she'd break your legs!

362
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,500
No!

363
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,100
It's too risky!

364
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Besides,

365
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,540
Even... even if we can
run away successfully,

366
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,380
how can we

367
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,740
survive on our own?

368
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,940
Mom, don't worry about it!

369
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,500
We can live

370
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
on my embroideries!

371
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,060
With my skills,

372
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,180
we can totally

373
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,060
make a living at them!

374
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,620
You don't need to worry!

375
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,620
I don't think it'll work.

376
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,380
With our current situation,

377
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,540
I'm afraid even returning to Yuhang
would be hard for us.

378
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,700
Mother, do you remember

379
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,500
Mr. Lin who once saved us?

380
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,580
We can take his boat

381
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,860
and go back!

382
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,060
We've made a plan.

383
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,260
You don't have to worry.

384
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,180
Shiyi,

385
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,740
I didn't expect

386
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,100
that you've arranged everything

387
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,060
ahead of time!

388
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,500
Looks like

389
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,460
my daughter is a smart and brave

390
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,220
grown-up now!

391
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,700
Okay,

392
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,500
I'll listen to you.

393
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,220
I'd love to do anything

394
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,180
as long as you are happy.

395
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,020
No matter what will happen,

396
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,020
I'll always have your back!

397
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,540
One year ago,

398
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,740
I personally made this wedding dress,

399
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,020
hoping I can

400
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,980
marry His Lordship

401
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,260
in this.

402
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,460
My Lady.

403
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,460
Put this away.

404
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,060
I won't need it anymore.

405
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,660
Mother.

406
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,740
Lianfang.

407
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,220
I feel so bad

408
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,700
that you have to marry

409
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,780
into Xu Family like this.

410
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,460
Mother,

411
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm sorry!

412
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,260
I humiliated our clan!

413
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,340
I feel sorry about that!

414
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,220
But it's

415
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,140
my own choice.

416
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,780
And I won't

417
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,380
regret it in the future.

418
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,700
Good girl!

419
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,260
Listen to me.

420
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,740
Although you'll be a concubine,

421
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,660
it doesn't mean
you don't have any chance.

422
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,300
Yuanniang

423
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,420
will die soon.

424
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,580
She doesn't have much time left.

425
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,460
The sister she desperately

426
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,740
wants the Marquis to marry

427
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,020
is just a concubine's daughter.

428
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,660
I know what you mean, mother!

429
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,220
I'm the legitimate daughter
from Qiao Family;

430
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,140
I have distinguished status.

431
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,100
She, however,
is just a concubine's daughter.

432
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,900
There's no way she can compare to me.

433
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,260
And now,

434
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,020
I'll marry into Xu Family
one step early.

435
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,900
I will have His Lordship

436
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,740
fall in love with me soon!

437
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,500
I will let him

438
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,500
think of me only

439
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,420
and forget about the others.

440
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,100
As long as you can win the Marquis over,

441
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,020
and with the favor

442
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,140
of the Great Madam,

443
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,380
one day,

444
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,380
if you give birth to His Lordship's child,

445
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,780
no worries,

446
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,660
with our Qiao Family having your back,

447
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,300
everything's possible!

448
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,260
I'll keep your words in mind, mother!

449
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,820
(A fair place produces
outstanding people.)

450
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,180
(Mansion of Xu)

451
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,420
Wrong! It's wrong!

452
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
Concubine can't enter
from the front gate,

453
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
but the side door only!

454
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,220
You...

455
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,820
Xiuyuan,

456
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,780
we are new here.

457
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,780
Don't make trouble.

458
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,260
-Yes.
-Yes.

459
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,220
Lift the sedan up!

460
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,500
Young man.

461
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,460
the sedan has to stop here.

462
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,740
According to the rules,

463
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,140
please let the bride walk in by herself.

464
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,420
It's raining

465
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,620
and the ground is all wet.

466
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,180
It's not convenient
for the bride to walk in.

467
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,420
Please make an exception for her

468
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,940
and move the sedan to the yard.

469
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,460
Okay.

470
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,500
Lift the sedan up!

471
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,300
Stop! Stop!

472
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,780
Don't you know the rules?

473
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,900
You are Nanny Zhang, right?

474
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,020
Nanny Zhang,

475
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,380
I'm Nanny Tao,
working for Her Ladyship.

476
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,980
Nanny Zhang, you are not new,

477
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,740
you should know better

478
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,780
the rules of taking in a concubine.

479
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,380
Please let Concubine Qiao get off the sedan
and walk in by herself.

480
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,900
Nanny Tao,

481
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,420
we know the rules,

482
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,380
but it's...

483
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,980
Rules should be obeyed.

484
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,820
Please let Concubine Qiao get off the sedan
and walk in by herself,

485
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,780
or else she'll miss the propitious time.

486
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,740
My Lady.

487
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,380
Nanny Zhang, she is concubine now.

488
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,260
Let's get in.

489
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,820
Concubine Qiao!

490
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,220
Concubine Qiao!

491
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,180
Here's a kind reminder.

492
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,700
Today is your wedding day.

493
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,980
The character “San”
[*3rd tone, means umbrella]

494
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,340
sounds similar to "San".
[*4th tone, means part ways]

495
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,460
It's not a good sign!

496
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,700
Our Mansion of Qiao

497
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,180
doesn't care about that!

498
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,380
Let's go!

499
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,180
Put away the umbrella.

500
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,420
My Lady!

501
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,060
Put it away.

502
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,940
Concubine Qiao,

503
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,660
it's called 'flowing in wealth'!

504
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
It's so late already!

505
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,500
Why isn't Lingyi here yet?

506
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,340
It's his wedding day

507
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,900
with Lianfang!

508
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,220
Mother, you worry too much.

509
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,460
Everything will be fine.

510
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,660
My fourth brother has been busy

511
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,140
with pursuing the escaped prisoner.

512
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,300
Perhaps he lost the track of time.

513
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,740
Mother, His Lordship
carries big responsibilities.

514
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,180
It's normal that he's too busy
to remember things.

515
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,420
And now,

516
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,260
Lingkuan and I

517
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,620
can stay by your side,

518
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,500
take care of you and enjoy a happy life,

519
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,300
it's all thanks

520
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,820
to His Lordship's protection!

521
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,660
You should

522
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,540
try to help your brother more.

523
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Don't be so lazy!

524
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,500
Dan Yang is as considerate as always.

525
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,660
Yuanniang

526
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,220
is capable and filial,

527
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,860
but she's too strong-minded

528
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,380
and always argues

529
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,940
with Lingyi.

530
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,660
I think

531
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,980
Lianfang is understanding,

532
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,460
and she really loves Lingyi.

533
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,620
If she can become

534
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,220
a good wife to Lingyi

535
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,700
like you are to Kuan'er,

536
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,820
I'll be so relieved.

537
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,420
Mother, no worries.

538
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,580
I'm sure His Lordship

539
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,140
knows you care about him!

540
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,260
Greetings, mother!

541
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,580
Brother, sister-in-law.

542
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,420
Yi'er, you are finally back!

543
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,500
Go and

544
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,580
check on Lianfang.

545
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,700
I feel a little tired.

546
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,860
I'll go check

547
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,900
on her another time.

548
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,620
That's ridiculous!

549
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,780
She just married you,

550
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,860
and you'll leave her alone?

551
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,300
She must be worried
and still waiting for you.

552
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,580
Go ahead.

553
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,460
I'm being inconsiderate!

554
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,060
I should care about her feelings.

555
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,500
Mother, don't worry.

556
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,700
I'll go right now.

557
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,500
Alright.

558
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,260
(Happy Event)

559
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,140
My Lord!

560
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,620
You've been busy the whole day.

561
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,420
Do you feel tired?

562
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,100
Would you like me
to play some music for you?

563
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,540
This is your

564
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,220
favorite fine white porcelain.

565
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,340
And I lit ambergris in this room.

566
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,620
Our Aunt said

567
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,820
it's your favorite scent.

568
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,900
So I used it to
make the room smell good.

569
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,300
Sorry, I made a mistake.

570
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,220
I'm

571
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,260
your concubine now,

572
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
I should call mother instead of aunt.

573
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,180
I guess I've got used

574
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,860
to calling her that for all these years.

575
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,380
Please don't

576
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,660
be mad at me, My Lord.

577
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,140
Then...

578
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,380
I'll serve you taking

579
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,820
a bath now.

580
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,300
I'm not a good person.

581
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,780
Why do you try so hard?

582
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,540
And how do you know

583
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,500
that this is not something I want?

584
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,740
Ever since I first met you,

585
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,660
I've fallen in love with you.

586
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,980
I can provide you

587
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,540
with a peaceful, safe

588
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
and wealthy life,

589
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,020
but,

590
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,020
nothing more than that.

591
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,900
That's not what I want!

592
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,180
I just want you to give me a chance!

593
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,300
It's late.

594
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,860
You should go to bed now.

595
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,620
My Lord!

596
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,060
My Lord, don't leave!

597
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,900
Please stay here

598
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,820
with me for one night!

599
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,180
Just one night!

600
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
Okay?

601
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,060
It's just a beginning.

602
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,340
I'm sure that I'll win your heart!

603
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,140
My Lord, how come you are back?

604
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,020
You and Concubine Qiao
just got married today.

605
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,780
The other men would be so happy

606
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,460
to have another wife.

607
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,140
You are the only one

608
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,580
who's bothered by this.

609
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
You talk too much today!

610
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,100
I am just worried

611
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,980
about you.

612
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,900
Both the court affairs and

613
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,460
your marital life keep you occupied.

614
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,620
Having a concubine

615
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,060
is a sweet and lovely thing

616
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,180
to the other men,

617
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,860
yet to you,

618
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,900
it's just

619
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,340
more responsibility.

620
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,860
Concubine Qiao married into
our Xu's all of a sudden.

621
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,420
We should make her feel at home.

622
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,980
Ask the servants to pay more attention

623
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,740
and try their best to meet her needs.

624
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
Take good care of her.

625
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,060
Understood, My Lord.

626
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,740
I'll take a rest now.

627
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,940
It's said Concubine Qiao

628
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
waited His Lordship till midnight,

629
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,220
but His Lordship visited her

630
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,220
only for a short period of time

631
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,540
before heading back to
Half-moon Chamber,

632
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,780
leaving Concubine Qiao sitting on the floor

633
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,060
and crying for a long time!

634
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,020
Really?

635
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,780
I thought His Lordship

636
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,820
would treat her differently
from the other two.

637
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,620
Turns out this Qiao woman

638
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,860
is just so-so!

639
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,380
Tell me about it!

640
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,620
Who are gossiping over there?

641
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,860
Come out, now!

642
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
-Great Madam!
-Great Madam!

643
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,980
How dare you

644
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,740
gossip about

645
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,940
your Masters?

646
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,340
Are you looking for death?

647
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,420
Great Madam!
We made a mistake!

648
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,540
Please spare our lives!

649
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,180
We won't do it again!

650
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,340
Get a human trafficker here.

651
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,580
Let him sell these two!

652
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,780
-Great Madam!
-Great Madam!

653
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,900
-Great Madam!
-Great Madam!

654
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,060
Great Madam! Please spare us!

655
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,180
Great Madam!

656
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,500
I came at a wrong time.

657
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,580
Sorry I disturbed your breakfast,
Great Madam!

658
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,060
Lianfang, you are here!

659
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,460
I'm glad you came!

660
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,820
I'm having breakfast alone.

661
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,740
It's so boring.

662
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,860
Have a seat.

663
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,860
Here.

664
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,580
Thank you, Great Madam!

665
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,620
I know it's been hard for you.

666
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,300
Look at your face.

667
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,980
You are losing weight.

668
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,860
His Lordship has been

669
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,820
busy with the court affairs,

670
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,980
so he's quite tired.

671
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,180
Please try to understand him.

672
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,980
Things will get better

673
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,860
when he's free.

674
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,060
His Lordship is busy every day.

675
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,260
The best I can do for him

676
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,100
is taking good care of myself.

677
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,180
Good! Good!

678
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,940
Great Madam,

679
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,620
in a few days,

680
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,780
you'll go to Ci'an Temple

681
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,060
and pray for our family.

682
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,540
I copied some Buddhist Scripture,

683
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,540
which will keep our Xu Family safe.

684
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,820
That's very thoughtful of you!

685
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,540
Great Madam,

686
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,820
why don't we let them

687
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,180
join us for breakfast?

688
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,540
They will go back

689
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,340
to their own places to eat.

690
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,180
Just take care of yourself.

691
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Eat more.

692
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,580
Look at you.

693
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,780
Here, eat some more!

694
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,700
Great Madam is treating you

695
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,940
as her own daughter!

696
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,060
You are right about that!

697
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,660
I've been treating

698
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,260
Lianfang as my daughter

699
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,300
since she was little.

700
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,940
And now I'm so happy

701
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,900
that she's become family.

702
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,420
Great Madam,

703
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,800
I haven't offered tea
to Her Ladyship yet.

704
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,100
Please enjoy your breakfast,

705
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,340
I'll take my leave now.

706
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,540
What a thoughtful kid!

707
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,460
Go ahead.

708
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,860
You two!

709
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,460
Why are you still standing there?

710
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,260
Go back and have your breakfast!

711
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,260
Yes.

712
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,220
Go.

713
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,340
She asked the two Concubines

714
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,620
to serve her breakfast

715
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,380
and said in public

716
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,900
that she'll have her back.

717
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,820
I think Great Madam

718
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,660
favors her too much!

719
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,580
She's just a concubine now.

720
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,460
If she replaced you as she wishes,

721
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,700
then... then our Zhun

722
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,140
would have a hard life from now on.

723
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,460
Mother just pities her

724
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,540
on the account

725
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,820
of Concubine Qiao.

726
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,140
As a concubine,

727
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,260
she won't be a problem to us.

728
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,740
Your Ladyship, Concubine Qiao is here.

729
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,660
Let her in.

730
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,620
Yes.

731
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,060
I'm here to greet you, sister!

732
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,500
Are you getting better, sister?

733
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,940
I could die at any time.

734
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,300
How can I get any better?

735
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,740
Sister, don't think too much.

736
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,380
Just take it easy and rest well.

737
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,380
Madam,

738
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,460
offer tea.

739
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,340
Sister.

740
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,300
Kneel.

741
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,820
Sister, please have some tea!
