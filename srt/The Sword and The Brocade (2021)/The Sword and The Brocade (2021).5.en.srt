=Episode 5=

19
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,919
Thank you, Yuanniang.

20
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,319
From now on,

21
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,879
you must speak and act cautiously

22
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,199
and serve His Lordship well.

23
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,279
Don't let His Lordship leave
in low spirits

24
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,159
like last night again.

25
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,399
You're right.

26
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,519
But I think

27
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:44,399
that absolute sincerity
will move a heart of stone.

28
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,639
Gradually,

29
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,759
His Lordship will surely
have pity on me.

30
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,479
You're not feeling well.

31
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,159
You should

32
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,239
take good care of your health.

33
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,559
I've been sick for a while.

34
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,119
With you serving His Lordship,

35
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,279
I feel at ease.

36
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,559
However, in terms of relationships,

37
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,439
you might not be aware

38
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,559
that even if sincerity

39
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,519
can move heaven and earth

40
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,959
and even break gold and stones,

41
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,759
people's hearts

42
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,279
are even harder than stones sometimes.

43
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,799
Your Ladyship.

44
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,279
I'm fine.

45
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,839
I shouldn't

46
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,239
keep you here longer today.

47
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,239
You may go.

48
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,839
I'll get going.

49
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,279
Your Ladyship.

50
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,759
I think...

51
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,839
Her sugar-coated words
hide cruel intentions.

52
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,759
She's not easy to deal with.

53
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,519
Your Ladyship, Concubine Wen is here.

54
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,359
Let her in.

55
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,759
Yes.

56
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,119
Are you feeling better?

57
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,159
Hearing your concern

58
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,479
makes me feel a lot better.

59
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,519
You're teasing me again.

60
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,079
This is the token
from the Wen family this month.

61
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,239
You are so nice.

62
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,799
Those on the same side must be frank
with each other.

63
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,039
Without you,

64
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,599
where would I be today?

65
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,519
Earlier,

66
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,839
Concubine Qiao came to greet you?

67
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,759
Yuanniang, you didn't see it.

68
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:47,959
Mother treats her

69
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,359
so differently.

70
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,279
If others see it,

71
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,639
they might think...

72
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,319
Look at me.

73
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:59,399
How can she compare to you?

74
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,239
Concubine Qiao

75
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,319
is mother's niece.

76
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,839
And she has the Qiao family
to back her up.

77
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,319
Even I

78
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,879
must be a bit lenient towards her.

79
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,679
Don't harbor unspoken criticisms.

80
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,679
You're right, Yuanniang.

81
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,999
I don't dare to do that.

82
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:22,719
It's just that...

83
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:25,799
The Qiao family is a prominent clan.

84
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,079
As the legitimate daughter,

85
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,279
she was willing to become a concubine.

86
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,599
I can't help

87
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,759
but wonder about this matter.

88
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,039
You always provide invaluable advice.

89
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,399
Please guide me.

90
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,159
I won't live long.

91
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,399
His Lordship is still young.

92
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,719
He'll surely get another legal wife
in the future.

93
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,759
Should we let Concubine Qiao
ascend to position,

94
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,279
making things difficult for others，

95
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,199
or let the wives help each other

96
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,359
like a tripartite balance of forces?

97
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,679
Which one do you think

98
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,759
would benefit the Wen family

99
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,479
and you more?

100
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,639
The Qiao family is also involved

101
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,799
in all the lines of business
that the Wen family is in.

102
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,679
Regarding the purchasing of items
in the mansion in the future...

103
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,399
I get it now.

104
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,839
Don't worry.

105
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,239
My Lord.

106
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,279
In the past few days,

107
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,679
we've done a thorough search
of the city's northern,

108
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,639
southern, and western parts.

109
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,039
Yet why didn't we do it
on the eastern part?

110
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,559
The capital's streets are dense

111
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,639
and crowded.

112
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,239
Liu Yong intends to hide himself.

113
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,559
If we want to find him,

114
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,679
it will be like searching for a needle
in a haystack.

115
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,759
It will be very difficult.

116
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,679
That is why you're intentionally

117
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:06,679
luring him into the eastern part
of the city,

118
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,079
then secretly sending men
to search for him.

119
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,559
That way, perhaps it will be
more convenient

120
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,639
to find him.

121
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,919
When Liu Yong notices that we've
eased up on our search,

122
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,719
he'll surely take the opportunity

123
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,759
to seek help.

124
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,679
When that time comes, we can

125
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,759
follow the clues to track him down

126
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,719
and find others
who are colluding with him.

127
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,519
What a great plan.

128
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,079
Search for him in every household.

129
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,239
Don't be negligent.

130
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,159
-Yes.
-Yes.

131
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,479
I've met Mr. Lin.

132
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,919
He's a righteous man.

133
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,439
I feel at ease

134
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,759
that you're leaving in his boat.

135
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,639
But what will happen after you leave?

136
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,119
In Yuhang, you and your mother

137
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,119
have no one to rely on.

138
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,439
I'm really worried.

139
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,359
Teacher, don't worry.

140
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:48,879
The skill you've taught me

141
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,519
is the thing I can rely most on.

142
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:51,839
No matter what happens in the future,

143
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,279
write to me.

144
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,079
You have someone to rely on.

145
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,399
You have me.

146
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,199
Thank you, Teacher.

147
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,239
By the way,

148
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,239
this is the money

149
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,439
for the embroidery

150
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,119
you asked Dongqing to bring last time.

151
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,079
Keep it well.

152
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,239
And these

153
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,039
are some clothing and items

154
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,399
that I've prepared for you.

155
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,079
The journey to Yuhang is long.

156
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,599
I hope that all will be well

157
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,799
with you and your mother.

158
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,039
Then I can feel at ease.

159
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:28,999
Look.

160
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,559
You're done with the embroidery
so quickly?

161
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,199
I even placed

162
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,679
a protection talisman inside.

163
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,639
Take it.

164
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,879
You're becoming more and more capable.

165
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,039
Look.

166
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,399
See how nice this is.

167
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,879
The stitches are so delicate.

168
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,599
Mother.

169
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,119
Replace your old one.

170
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,839
You've been using that
for so many years already.

171
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,519
I still remember that this

172
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,479
was the first embroidery item

173
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,759
you made for me

174
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,559
when you just started
learning embroidery.

175
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,279
I've had it with me for so many years.

176
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,479
I can't bear to part with it.

177
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,159
I won't throw it away.

178
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:06,439
I'll keep it for you.

179
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,919
Keep it well.

180
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:11,359
I'll place it here first.

181
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,439
All right, go to bed.

182
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,799
We must travel a long way tomorrow.

183
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,839
I'll sleep with you here tonight.

184
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,359
My goodness.

185
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:22,039
All right, sleep here.

186
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:30,959
Today,

187
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,759
you went to say goodbye to Master Jian?

188
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,879
We're leaving tomorrow.

189
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,039
You're really not reluctant
to leave at all?

190
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,319
My three years staying in Yuhang

191
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,919
was my happiest days.

192
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,119
Back then,

193
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,719
we might be poor

194
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,479
and struggle to make ends meet,

195
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,079
but

196
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,839
we weren't at anyone's mercy.

197
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,679
And we didn't need to worry
about doing something wrong

198
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,959
and being blamed and punished.

199
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,479
We were so carefree.

200
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:00,919
Yes.

201
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,679
It's been a while

202
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,199
since I've seen you smile happily.

203
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,718
Back then, I remember

204
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,759
that we had a garden full of vegetables.

205
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,319
Dongqing and I also had

206
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,598
a lot of chickens, ducks and geese.

207
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,399
You're even talking about that?

208
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,679
You two made the place

209
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,199
such a mess daily.

210
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,199
By the way, do you remember

211
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:24,879
when I went to the hill

212
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,359
to see the stars one time,

213
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,639
and I accidentally

214
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,519
fell into a quagmire?

215
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:32,279
How can I forget that?

216
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,639
Back then, I remember

217
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,759
that when you came out

218
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:35,879
from the quagmire,

219
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,039
you looked like a mud monkey.

220
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,879
I even pinched your ears

221
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,199
and lectured you all the way home.

222
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,159
Those were

223
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,439
good times.

224
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,799
Mother.

225
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,319
When we get to Yuhang,

226
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,199
let's plant
a garden of vegetables again.

227
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,319
Then let's have a big pet dog.

228
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,279
I'll be responsible for earning money,

229
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,759
and you'll enjoy spending the money.

230
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,359
All right.

231
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,439
Whatever you say.

232
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,559
If you're happy,

233
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,879
I'm happy.

234
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,719
I'm just worried

235
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,119
that after we leave,

236
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,999
I don't know how chaotic

237
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,359
the Luo family will become.

238
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,039
Mother, in leaving,

239
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,359
there's actually another advantage.

240
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,159
What is it?

241
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,639
Look.

242
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,039
Wuniang is already engaged

243
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,239
with Mr. Qian.

244
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,519
That only leaves me and Erniang.

245
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,039
Erniang might not be

246
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,439
that close or nice to me,

247
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,479
but

248
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,719
I also don't want her

249
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,479
to marry someone like Wang Yu.

250
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,159
If I leave,

251
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:40,799
she must marry into the Xu family.

252
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,839
Then her marriage with the Wang family
won't push through anymore.

253
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,359
In that case,

254
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,399
it's a good thing

255
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,679
for us to leave.

256
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,519
Right.

257
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:52,039
So don't worry.

258
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:55,519
All right, I won't worry.

259
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,559
I'm not worried.

260
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:57,919
Let's sleep.

261
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,599
All right.

262
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,919
Amber is on Her Ladyship's side.

263
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,879
I've already thought of a way

264
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,799
to lure her away.

265
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,119
She shouldn't be blamed if she's unaware
of what's going on.

266
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,119
I hope that Her Ladyship

267
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,559
won't give her a hard time.

268
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,639
Let's go.

269
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,759
Bad news, My Lady.

270
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,279
Her Ladyship is summoning you.

271
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,239
She said that Madam Wang

272
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,359
from Duke Mao's Mansion is here.

273
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,559
She wants to talk to you.

274
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:40,079
Why did she suddenly come here
at this moment?

275
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,639
It's almost time.

276
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,959
This is what we'll do.

277
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:44,879
Dongqing and I will go
to Ci'an Temple first

278
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,519
to wait for Mr. Lin's men.

279
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,359
This way,

280
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,799
it'll be easier for you
to get away later.

281
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,479
That's our only option.

282
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,919
Be careful.

283
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,319
Don't worry.

284
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,439
We'll wait for you at Ci'an Temple.

285
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,479
Come on.

286
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,439
We'll get going.

287
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,319
Let's go.

288
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,862
(Ci'an Temple)

289
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,879
I hope that Yuanniang
will get well soon.

290
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:55,199
May the Xu family be in good health
and things will go smoothly for us.

291
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,639
Amitabha.

292
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,119
Amitabha.

293
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,119
Amitabha.

294
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,519
Amitabha.

295
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,799
Lady Shiyi

296
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,359
is indeed cultured

297
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,839
virtuous and dignified.

298
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,679
Madam Luo.

299
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,599
You've taught her well.

300
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,239
She's lucky

301
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,319
that you like her.

302
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,239
I suddenly came without notice today.

303
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,799
I hope you won't mind, Madam Luo.

304
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,919
Since I've already seen her,

305
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:30,799
then

306
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,399
I'll get going.

307
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,839
No worries.

308
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,159
Mother.

309
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,639
I'll go and see Madam Wang off.

310
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,399
Great.

311
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,879
What a sensible child.

312
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,199
Yu'er complimented you a lot before.

313
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,799
I had my doubts.

314
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,599
Now, I know

315
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,319
that he's telling the truth.

316
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,239
You're too kind, Madam Wang.

317
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,439
I'll go ahead.

318
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,559
Take care.

319
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:39,039
Madam, slow down.

320
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,639
Take it slow.

321
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,159
Madam, are you all right?

322
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,519
I'm fine.

323
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,559
It should be here.

324
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,159
Mr. Lin's horse carriage

325
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,359
must be arriving soon, right?

326
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,399
I think so.

327
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:07,879
What's the matter?

328
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:08,959
Where's my perfume satchel?

329
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,959
Why is my perfume satchel gone?

330
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,399
Is it in the luggage?

331
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,439
No.

332
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,239
This morning,

333
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:15,519
I still had it with me.

334
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:16,959
Well...

335
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,759
I must have lost it along the way.

336
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:19,479
This won't do.

337
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,199
Shiyi

338
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,479
just embroidered
that perfume satchel for me.

339
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,319
I must go back to find it.

340
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,599
I'll go and find it then.

341
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,919
No, you wait here.

342
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:25,999
I'll be right back.

343
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,959
You must be quick then.

344
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:29,439
All right.

345
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,559
Amitabha.

346
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,359
Amitabha.

347
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,239
Amitabha.

348
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,199
My Lord, we found Liu Yong.

349
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,639
Amitabha.

350
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:51,719
Amitabha.

351
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,359
Amitabha.

352
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:00,439
Lingyi, what happened?

353
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,479
Bring mother

354
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,799
and the others to rest first.

355
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,359
Before I come back,

356
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,959
remember not to leave Ci'an Temple.

357
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,399
Don't worry, Lingyi.

358
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,759
Amitabha.

359
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:17,439
Amitabha.

360
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,599
Where's your brother?

361
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,439
He went to take a dump.

362
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,759
He said he'll be right back.

363
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,959
Kuan'er.

364
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,319
Don't be careless with your words.

365
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:32,679
Yes.

366
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,715
(Ci'an Temple)

367
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,599
Dongqing.

368
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,559
My Lady.

369
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:20,519
Where's my mother?

370
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:21,679
Your mother said that she lost

371
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:22,479
her perfume satchel along the way.

372
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,559
She went back to find it.

373
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,279
Didn't you see her

374
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:25,519
when you came here?

375
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,519
No.

376
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:28,759
Come on, let's go and find her.

377
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,079
Liu Yong.

378
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,119
Mother.

379
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,159
Madam.

380
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,239
Mother.

381
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,599
Madam.

382
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,199
-Madam.
-Mother.

383
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:38,879
Mother.

384
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,959
-Madam.
-Mother.

385
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,599
Mother!

386
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,119
Madam.

387
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:52,999
Mother.

388
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:00,719
Mother.

389
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,639
Mother.

390
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,439
Mother!

391
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,639
What happened, Mother?

392
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,479
Mother!

393
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,199
Mother.

394
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,319
Master.

395
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,719
Did a woman request

396
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,759
to stay in your temple while waiting?

397
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,479
The temple

398
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,119
has only let the Xu family in today.

399
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,479
I wonder if they're the ones
you're looking for.

400
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:01,359
Xu family?

401
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,679
That doesn't seem to be Lady Luo.

402
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,599
Have you seen anyone

403
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:07,999
waiting outside the temple?

404
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,439
No.

405
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,439
Young Master.

406
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,959
The boat will be leaving soon.

407
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,039
Perhaps they were delayed

408
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:24,919
for some reason.

409
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,639
This is a very important matter.

410
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,839
I don't think they're coming.

411
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:31,999
I think

412
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,879
they might have changed their minds.

413
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,599
If they change their minds,

414
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:37,719
based on Lady Luo's character,

415
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,879
she will surely send someone to tell me.

416
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,879
Could something have happened to them?

417
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:45,119
Young Master, Lady Luo is very clever.

418
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,279
Nothing will happen to her.

419
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,359
Young Master.

420
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,679
This business is very important.

421
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,479
We can't delay the sailing time.

422
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,839
Let's go.

423
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,599
I'm sorry for your loss.

424
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,199
She's gone.

425
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,919
You must go on living.

426
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,319
What happened?

427
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:27,119
My Lord, someone died up ahead.

428
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:27,999
We need to take your mother's body

429
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,639
for examination in our office.

430
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:30,879
If you don't let go,

431
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,439
we can't do our jobs.

432
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,599
I understand how you feel.

433
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:37,999
However,

434
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,759
you must let the deceased rest in peace.

435
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,199
My lady.

436
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,839
Don't you want

437
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,999
to catch your mother's killer?

438
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,599
Let them bring your mother's body

439
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,439
to the government office

440
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,399
to let the post-mortem examiner
check her body.

441
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:07,999
The more you delay it,

442
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,759
the farther the killer can escape.

443
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,079
Think about

444
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,399
what you should do.

445
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,079
Congratulations for catching
the fugitive, My Lord.

446
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,799
Prepare a horse carriage

447
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,079
to bring Lady Luo back to her home.

448
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:57,919
Yes.

449
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,439
Lady Luo, this way please.

450
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,199
My Lord.

451
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,239
The Luo family's concubine

452
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,199
and the pirate Liu Yong

453
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,159
appeared here at the same time.

454
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,639
Keep an eye on the government office.

455
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,639
I suspect that the death
of Luo family's concubine

456
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,959
is related to Liu Yong.

457
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,079
My Lord, don't worry.

458
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,719
I'll keep an eye on them to make sure
that they'll investigate it quickly.

459
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,720
(Residence of Luo)

460
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:42,216
(Birth Mother Ms. Lv's Memorial Tablet)

461
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,239
My lady.

462
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,239
It's all my fault.

463
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,759
If I had stopped Madam,

464
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,239
if I were the one who left,

465
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,079
she wouldn't have died.

466
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,679
How can it be your fault?

467
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,559
I don't blame you.

468
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,039
Mother won't blame you either.

469
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:17,879
Dongqing.

470
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,639
Mother will protect us from heaven.

471
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,679
By the way, let me show you something.

472
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,919
What's this?

473
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,999
When my mother was killed,

474
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,679
she was holding this.

475
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,359
I think...

476
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,119
My lady.

477
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,519
My lady,
Shuntian Prefect was just here.

478
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,399
He and your father chatted

479
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,919
for half an hour.

480
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,599
Now, he just left.

481
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,839
If you and Shuntian Prefect

482
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,399
weren't from the same batch,

483
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:09,399
they wouldn't be able to close
the case so fast.

484
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:11,919
If this becomes a big deal,

485
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:15,239
it will affect the marriage
with the Wang family.

486
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,119
But I don't think Qingtong's death

487
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,799
is that simple.

488
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:22,959
The case shouldn't be closed this way.

489
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,279
I know that you

490
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,759
are a sentimental man.

491
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,919
It's just that
Qingtong took Shiyi out

492
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,239
without permission.

493
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,919
If they continue the investigation

494
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:34,479
and ridiculous rumors abound,

495
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,999
it will be harder for you

496
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,799
to get reinstated.

497
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,359
Qingtong had always been docile
and well-behaved.

498
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,559
After going to Yuhang for three years,

499
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,279
why did she become
so impetuous and unbridled?

500
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,079
She also badly influenced

501
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,919
her daughter.

502
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,119
You must

503
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:09,559
teach Shiyi well.

504
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:10,799
Don't worry.

505
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,959
I'll surely discipline her well.

506
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,399
Father.

507
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,639
I heard that someone from
the Shuntian Prefecture Office came.

508
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,039
Did they catch the killer?

509
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,039
Shiyi.

510
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,959
According to their investigation,

511
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:26,159
Concubine Lv unintentionally

512
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,599
found traces of the fugitive

513
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,559
and was silenced.

514
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,759
Fortunately, Marquis Yongping
is extraordinarily brave.

515
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,279
He had already caught the killer.

516
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,799
Concubine Lv should be able
to rest in peace.

517
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,239
You can feel at ease.

518
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:38,639
Fugitive?

519
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,839
The killer was a fugitive?

520
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,559
Shiyi.

521
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,879
The Shuntian Prefecture Office
already closed the case.

522
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,119
It should be the truth.

523
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:52,039
Don't worry.

524
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,279
We'll surely

525
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,319
bury your mother well.

526
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,999
Don't be too sad.

527
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,279
No, that's not right.

528
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,799
Father, that fugitive wasn't the killer.

529
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:13,279
It was another person.

530
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,359
The government office already
concluded this case.

531
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,679
Don't speak nonsense.

532
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,439
Father, this case is more than
it appears to be.

533
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,399
We can't let the real killer

534
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,359
get away.

535
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,239
Father, please go
to the Shuntian Prefecture Office

536
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,839
to ask them to investigate again.

537
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,319
Your mother was killed by a fugitive.

538
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,959
Why must you deliberately complicate it?

539
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,599
Father, if you don't believe me,

540
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:33,759
I can prove it.

541
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,839
Are you done?

542
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,359
Father!

543
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,679
Don't cause more troubles.

544
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,999
Go to your room.

545
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,799
Father, you're afraid that if they
continue the investigation,

546
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:51,399
it will affect your reinstatement,
right?

547
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,479
How impetuous!

548
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,279
Don't you know

549
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,079
what the reinstatement means

550
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,879
to the Luo family?

551
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,919
Besides,

552
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,679
your mother died

553
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,479
because you disobeyed the house rules

554
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,759
and left without permission.

555
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,839
That was why that happened.

556
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,839
I'm already kind enough

557
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,239
not to hold you responsible

558
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,319
for leaving without permission.

559
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,079
I shouldn't have expected
anything from you.

560
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,639
Stop.

561
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,679
Where are you going?

562
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:27,999
My Lord.

563
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,079
Shiyi just lost the person
closest to her.

564
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,439
It's unavoidable for her to lose it.

565
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,839
That was why she disrespected you.

566
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,519
For the sake

567
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:36,519
of Concubine Lv,

568
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:37,839
be lenient to her.

569
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,399
I will discipline

570
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,999
Shiyi well.

571
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,599
You may all go.

572
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:58,519
Yes.

573
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,359
Shiyi, stay.

574
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,199
Her Ladyship

575
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,279
already asked someone to secretly check

576
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:14,999
you and the Marquis Yongping's Ba-Zi.
[* Ba-Zi is one's birth date and time]

577
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,919
Upon hearing that,

578
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,879
I can finally

579
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,239
feel at ease.

580
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,279
Soon,

581
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,559
you'll be the wife
of Marquis Yongping.

582
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,639
Someday,

583
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,359
even Her Ladyship

584
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,519
will be at your mercy.

585
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:35,999
When that time comes,

586
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,039
you don't need

587
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,599
to be at Her Ladyship mercy anymore.

588
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,119
I'll surely let her experience

589
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,879
how it is to humble herself.

590
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,599
My good daughter.

591
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,639
Your father thinks

592
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,719
that Concubine Lv
was impetuous and unbridled

593
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,399
and took you out without permission.

594
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,639
But I know

595
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,279
that wasn't the case.

596
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,519
You were the one who wanted
to leave the mansion.

597
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:08,279
You wanted to escape from your marriage.

598
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,919
So what if I did?

599
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:16,479
Shouldn't I escape from it?

600
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:18,519
Marriage has always
been decided by parents

601
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,719
and coordinated by matchmakers.

602
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,919
That's how it has always been.

603
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,919
You can only obey and be grateful.

604
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,439
I've never cared

605
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,199
about the Luo family's
wealth and status.

606
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,839
Why can't I decide

607
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:31,239
my own fate?

608
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,639
Why is it such a monstrous crime

609
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,079
for me to leave the Luo family?

610
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,639
Why must I only obey and be grateful?

611
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,439
Even princesses

612
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:41,679
can't decide their own fates

613
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,319
and not dare to say
that they'll rely on themselves.

614
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:44,799
Besides,

615
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,839
you're just the daughter of a concubine.

616
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,479
You left the Luo family today.

617
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,879
Then

618
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,119
what happened?

619
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,319
You were the cause

620
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,519
of your mother's death.

621
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,879
What are you talking about?

622
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,639
If you didn't want to escape
from marriage,

623
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,639
Concubine Lv

624
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,199
wouldn't have left the mansion today,

625
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,599
then she wouldn't have died.

626
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:21,599
If she's looking down on you
from heaven,

627
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,919
will she regret

628
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,879
giving birth

629
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,719
to such a selfish
and capricious daughter?

630
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,159
Things in the past
are beyond redemption,

631
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,039
but we can prevent the same mistakes
in the future.

632
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,159
I hope you conduct yourself well.

633
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,639
Don't drag others down because
of your own selfishness.

634
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,839
I'm not Concubine Lv.

635
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,439
I won't indulge you.

636
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:03,639
What's the matter?

637
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:07,239
The Luo family's concubine
was suddenly killed.

638
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,639
She's very pitiful indeed.

639
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,319
But if you think about it carefully,

640
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,999
something doesn't

641
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,439
seem right.

642
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,959
What do you mean?

643
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,239
I heard

644
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,959
that aside from their maid,

645
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,439
the Luo family's concubine

646
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,839
and her daughter

647
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,239
didn't have any guards

648
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,199
with them that day.

649
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,119
That means they left the mansion
on their own.

650
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:34,759
They didn't get

651
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,599
Madam Luo's permission.

652
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,919
It's fine to go out on their own

653
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,439
to pray at the temple, right?

654
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,919
That's even stranger.

655
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:45,559
There was

656
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,279
no special occasion that day.

657
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:50,079
Why did they choose that day?

658
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,799
Why did they choose

659
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:53,999
the day when our entire Xu family

660
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,359
went to Ci'an Temple

661
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:57,359
to pray for Her Ladyship?

662
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,879
You keep beating around the bush.

663
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,519
What exactly do you want to say?

664
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,999
I'm guessing...

665
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,399
This is just my guess.

666
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,919
Perhaps they already knew

667
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,439
that we were going to Ci'an temple,

668
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,159
so they intentionally went there

669
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,199
to pretend to meet us coincidentally.

670
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,239
Of course we couldn't ignore them,

671
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:23,879
and we'd have to entertain them a bit.

672
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,039
Won't we get closer to each other then?

673
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:27,919
Of course,

674
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:30,239
we can't blame them

675
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,839
for what they wanted to do.

676
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,479
However, man proposes, and God disposes.

677
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,959
That murder happened.

678
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,719
Right.

679
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,919
Kill me if you dare.

680
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,079
You don't need to pretend to be brave

681
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,079
in front of me.

682
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,519
If you really wanted to die,

683
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:28,359
why did you let me
catch you alive twice?

684
00:36:29,678 --> 00:36:30,999
You're living on and enduring the shame

685
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:32,718
in the hopes

686
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:34,999
that after Lu Yong escapes,

687
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,639
he'll seek help from your backer

688
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,519
and get you out of prison.

689
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:44,879
Bring him here.

690
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:09,959
Liu Yong.

691
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,559
You were the one who killed him?

692
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
I'm an official, he was a thief.

693
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,559
I originally wanted to spare his life,

694
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:22,919
but he wanted to die.

695
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,239
It's all my fault.

696
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,039
Jiang Huai.

697
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:42,759
You and Liu Yong
were originally fishermen.

698
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,439
You couldn't make a living
because of the sea ban,

699
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,159
so you had no choice but to go
into illegal business

700
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,319
and become pirates.

701
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,359
Even if what you did is unforgivable,

702
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,759
it's understandable.

703
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:56,799
As long as you tell me who you're
colluding with

704
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,119
and guarantee

705
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,839
that you and your men

706
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,599
will stop being pirates,

707
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,599
I, Xu Lingyi, swear on my life

708
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,399
to keep you safe.

709
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,759
Even if you release me,

710
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,359
we can only go into this path again.

711
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:18,719
I promise.

712
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,479
I'll surely lift the sea ban,

713
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,719
so you can freely perform
maritime trading.

714
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,799
The sea ban is
the Ming Dynasty's ancestral policy.

715
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:36,759
You're just a marquis.

716
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:38,959
How dare you say such arrogant words?

717
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,559
You think I'm a three-year-old child?

718
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,839
You really intend to lift the sea ban?

719
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,159
To establish oneself in this world,

720
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,199
one must ordain a conscience
for heaven and earth

721
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,079
and secure life and fortune
for the people.

722
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,399
In order to lift the sea ban,

723
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,039
even if it's like an ant trying
to shake a tree,

724
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,039
even if I'm crushed to pieces,

725
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,479
I'm willing to do it.

726
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,119
It's useless.

727
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,599
Even if I tell you

728
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,999
who that person is,

729
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:20,399
you can't win against him.

730
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,599
You're so stubborn.

731
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,519
Don't you want to reunite

732
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,559
with your wife and children?

733
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,719
I have no wife and children anymore.

734
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,359
I have no one to worry about anymore.

735
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,319
Go.

736
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,239
Bury Liu Yong's body well.

737
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:06,039
Yes.

738
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,119
The prisoner committed suicide!

739
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,839
We spent so much effort to catch him.

740
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,439
You even got wounded because of this.

741
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,719
Now, all our efforts are wasted.

742
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:44,839
Not necessarily.

743
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,199
Who is the person Jiang Huai said

744
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,519
that I couldn't win against?

745
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,759
Among all the officials
in government,

746
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:51,999
there are only a few people

747
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,119
with such power.

748
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,479
The one who wants to maintain
the sea ban the most

749
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,519
is the most possible person

750
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,959
who was colluding with them.

751
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,679
(If you didn't want to escape
from your marriage,)

752
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,159
(Concubine Lv wouldn't have left
the mansion.)

753
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,199
(Then she wouldn't have met the killer,)

754
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:21,479
(and she wouldn't have died.)

755
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:22,999
(You were the one)

756
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:26,279
(who personally led to her death.)

757
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,519
Shiyi.

758
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,119
Teacher.

759
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,039
Shiyi, you've suffered.

760
00:41:58,759 --> 00:41:59,919
It was my fault.

761
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:06,759
I... I caused my mother's death.

762
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:08,319
Don't be ridiculous.

763
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:10,479
It was an accident.

764
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,719
What did it have to do with you?

765
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,559
Her Ladyship is right.

766
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,239
If I didn't want to escape
from my marriage,

767
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:24,359
my mother wouldn't have died.

768
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,079
No.

769
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,759
That's not true.

770
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:39,159
If I could turn back time,

771
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:44,319
I surely wouldn't do that again.

772
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:48,079
I'd surely listen to them.

773
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:49,759
I know.

774
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:51,599
I know that.

775
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,039
But Shiyi,

776
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,879
the Concubine Lv I knew

777
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:00,199
had always resigned herself
to adversity.

778
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,519
But she abandoned everything

779
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,079
to escape with you.

780
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:06,999
Did you ever wonder why?

781
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,079
Because you're all she cared about.

782
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,959
She didn't want you
to be forced to accept

783
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,119
an unfair destiny.

784
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:15,199
She wanted you to be happy.

785
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:17,479
If you're unhappy,

786
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,399
she will only feel more upset.

787
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,079
I...

788
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,159
My child.

789
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,399
As long as you're well,

790
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,479
I'm willing to do everything.

791
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,799
No matter what happens in the future,

792
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:35,279
I'll support you.

793
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:44,639
Remember.

794
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,719
Those who want

795
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:48,199
to put the blame on you

796
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,119
have ulterior motives.

797
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:51,919
They want to break you.

798
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:52,959
Only in doing so

799
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:54,239
will you do

800
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:55,519
what they want,

801
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:57,079
you know?

802
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,119
Don't worry, Teacher.

803
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:25,199
I'll be fine.

804
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,679
That is the best way

805
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:33,039
to repay your mother.

806
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:42,319
By the way, Teacher,

807
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:46,839
the one who killed my mother

808
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,679
might not necessarily be the fugitive.

809
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,479
Why do you say so?

810
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,399
Didn't the government already
conclude the case?

811
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:57,479
Look at this cloth.

812
00:44:58,759 --> 00:44:59,439
That day,

813
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:01,359
my mother held this in her hand.

814
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,359
I'm thinking

815
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:04,919
the killer must have left it.

816
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,159
It's just that the fugitive's clothing

817
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:08,319
was completely different

818
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,199
from this cloth.

819
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:11,399
Teacher.

820
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:13,039
You've seen countless fabrics.

821
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,359
Can you tell

822
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:15,959
where this came from?

823
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:19,079
This is xuejuan.
[*Xuejuan is a type of fabric]

824
00:45:19,479 --> 00:45:20,639
It's not considered expensive.

825
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:23,039
Anyone with a little money
can afford it.

826
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,639
It's just that I've never seen

827
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:29,119
this embroidery technique before,

828
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:30,239
especially

829
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:31,879
the pattern on this embroidery.

830
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,639
It's very unique.

831
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:36,639
It's a shame that this is just
a torn piece of fabric.

832
00:45:37,479 --> 00:45:38,879
It's hard to be recognized.

833
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,959
Don't be anxious.

834
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,039
Let me copy this pattern first,

835
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:45,879
then I'll check for more information.

836
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:11,639
Dongqing.

837
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:14,119
My lady.

838
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:16,199
I spent so much effort

839
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,039
to get this.

840
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:20,159
But will this do?

841
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,359
Her Ladyship has strict orders

842
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:22,879
not to let you go out.

843
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,439
If they find out...

844
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:25,399
-Then...
-What are you afraid of?

845
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:27,359
She's still hoping that I'll marry
into the Wang family.

846
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:28,799
She won't do anything to me.

847
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:31,799
This is great, My lady.

848
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:33,199
You've finally pulled yourself together.

849
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:34,119
A few days ago,

850
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,319
seeing you not eating
or drinking anything

851
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:36,999
scared me so much.

852
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,199
Teacher is right.

853
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:42,199
My mother only cared about me.

854
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:44,159
I can't give up on myself.

855
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:45,759
Besides,

the killer is still out there.

857
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,599
I must find the real killer

858
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:51,079
to avenge my mother.

859
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,399
Go to the kitchen and check

860
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:11,719
if the bird's nest is ready.

861
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:13,359
Her Ladyship will have it later.

862
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:14,719
There can't be any delays.

863
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:15,519
Yes.
