19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,240
It's such a shabby place.

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,760
Sister-in-law,

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,120
sorry you have to go through this.

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,120
But we had no other choice.

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,080
Don't know who found out

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,360
that it's our Wen family

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,040
who made the silk farmer died.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,600
They sent a message

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
and asked us to figure out a way

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,480
to destroy Madam Xu's embroidery work.

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,640
Otherwise,

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,440
they'll report it to the prefecture.

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,720
Except for you,

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,720
no one else

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
could get the opportunity to do it.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,640
I understand what you said.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,600
As long as our Wen family is safe,

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm okay with suffering a little.

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
Thank you for your understanding.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,560
Yu is after all an illegitimate son.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,480
And Madam Xu

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
shows no mercy to you.

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
You have no one to rely on

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,440
except for our Wen family.

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
As long as

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
you do what we say,

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
your brother and I

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,760
will definitely make it up to you.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
But you were too

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
careless this time.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
How could you let Madam Xu

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,800
catch you red-handed?

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,000
I've tried my best to be careful.

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,240
But I didn't expect

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
that Her Ladyship
had suspected me already.

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
She even thinks

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,880
that I'm an informant of the Ou family.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
Yu is also implicated because of this.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,080
You are Yu's biological mother.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,760
They will allow you
to be back sooner or later.

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,160
But no one

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,360
should find out that

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,160
our Wen family is related to this thing.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
If it's exposed

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,280
and our Wen family is destroyed,

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,440
Yu's future

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,080
will be bleaker.

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,720
I understand.

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,560
Shiyi.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
Since people heard that His Majesty

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,000
praised your embroidery

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,120
of the Four Divinities,

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,480
our Xianling Pavilion

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,360
has received many orders

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
from both inside and outside
of the city.

74
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,360
You've studied and
practiced embroidery for years.

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,760
I'm so proud of you

76
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,520
for the acknowledgement you gained.

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,600
Teacher, it's all because

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,880
of your careful instructions

79
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,760
and the help from all the other girls.

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
His Majesty's recognition

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
isn't just

82
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,520
for me.

83
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,560
By the way,

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,880
has Mr. Ou visited you recently?

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,640
No.

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,680
I haven't seen him for quite a while.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,720
Amber,

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
try to find out how

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,840
Mr. Ou is doing.

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm worried

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,480
that he'll be blamed by Marquis Jingyuan

92
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,160
for the embroidery matter this time.

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,880
Yes, Your Ladyship.

94
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,760
Have some tea.

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,200
Master Jian, Master Luo.

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Congratulations.

97
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
This is a piece of embroidery we made,

98
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,640
named "Loved By Your Students."

99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,360
It's our congratulatory gift
for you two.

100
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,400
When we became homeless,

101
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,920
if you hadn't taken us in

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480
and taught us embroidery skills,

103
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,800
we might have already starved to death,

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,520
and we couldn't have been able

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,360
to make a living at embroidery.

106
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,360
That's very thoughtful of you.

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
And you don't have to thank us.

108
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Actually, it's my

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,400
original intention

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,440
to help you

111
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,640
through embroidery.

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
If you can carry forward

113
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,280
the embroidery skills

114
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,720
and help more women,

115
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,840
it'll be the best payoff

116
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160
for Master Jian.

117
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,240
We promise we won't

118
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,640
let you two down.

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,280
Ou Yanxing made such a big mistake.

120
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
He should be removed from our clan

121
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
and kicked out of our house.

122
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,160
But father only flogged him a little.

123
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Looks like father has decided

124
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,720
to make him his heir.

125
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,000
You really don't have

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,520
to be mad like this.

127
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Father

128
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,120
may feel sorry

129
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,880
for his mother,

130
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,200
so he

131
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,520
favors and spoils

132
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,880
him a little more.

133
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
I can't find peace

134
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,200
until I get rid of him.

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,960
I've sacrificed so much

136
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,080
for father and our Ou family.

137
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,280
Why does

138
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,120
father still favor him more?

139
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,880
If you really want to get rid of him,

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
it's not something

141
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,960
that can't be done.

142
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
Your life will be in danger

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,960
if people see that you are here.

144
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
You really don't have to thank me.

145
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,520
Mr. Ou.

146
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,280
You are badly injured

147
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,600
because of us.

148
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,560
Please let me do something for you.

149
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
Otherwise,

150
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
we won't forgive ourselves.

151
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
Why did they hit you this hard?

152
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,280
It must be very painful.

153
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,720
Amber.

154
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,200
You know

155
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
that I've had someone in my heart.

156
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,400
Master Lixing.

157
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,080
I want to see Ou Yanxing.

158
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,640
Lixing.

159
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
What is he doing here?

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,840
Master Lixing.

161
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,200
Master Yanxing is taking a nap.

162
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,240
It's not convenient for him to see you.

163
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,720
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

164
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
Please go back and take a rest.

165
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,640
You are just a servant.
How dare you stop me?

166
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,760
Get out of my way.

167
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,960
The physician said

168
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
that he needs

169
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,680
good rest to recover.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Is he that seriously injured?

171
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,720
All the more reason for me
to check on him.

172
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,960
Young Master.

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Young Master.

174
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,720
Lixing.

175
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,520
What brought you here?

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,400
You are injured.

177
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,760
I'm your big brother.

178
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
Of course I'll come and check on you.

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,040
Antai.

180
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,600
You forgot to put away the medicine.

181
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,320
Are you waiting for me to do that?

182
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Sorry. Sorry.

183
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,600
It's my fault.

184
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,080
I'll put it away right now.

185
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,440
Yanxing.

186
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
You are too soft-hearted

187
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,920
and you always go easy on the servants.

188
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,680
Apparently you haven't finished
applying the medicine.

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,680
Lin Shan.

190
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,320
Yes.

191
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,560
Apply the medicine for Yanxing.

192
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,520
Master Yanxing.

193
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
Please.

194
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
Young Master.

195
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,720
Let me apply the medicine for you.

196
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,240
No wonder

197
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,760
you let Antai guard the door.

198
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,240
You are still in the mood for fun
while you are injured.

199
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm really impressed.

200
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,720
Lixing, please keep it to yourself.

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,760
Don't worry.

202
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,400
I would feel embarrassed

203
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,880
to talk about such shameful thing.

204
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,760
Amber,

205
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,120
it's okay now.

206
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,680
Mr. Ou, you are injured.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
Please sit down first.

208
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
I won't tell anybody

209
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,760
about what happened today.

210
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,400
I will ask Antai to see you off.

211
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
No one will see you.

212
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,280
And don't come here anymore.

213
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,200
I overreached myself

214
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
and I know you are way out of my league.

215
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,920
Sorry that I offended you.

216
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
I didn't mean that.

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,640
I know I'm lowborn

218
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,560
and I dare not have
any wishful thinking.

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,040
But I also know

220
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,080
that I understand you the most.

221
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,400
Because I'm just like you,

222
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
wishing the best

223
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,080
for the person I love

224
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,200
and asking for nothing in return.

225
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,720
My Lord.

226
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Anything bothers you?

227
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,040
Marquis Jingyuan has put
Wang Jiubao's wife and son

228
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,400
under house arrest in Nanjing.

229
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
Wang Jiubao is
the most influential leader

230
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,720
of the remaining pirates.

231
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,040
The court is going to
offer them enlistment.

232
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,600
If we can find

233
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
his family,

234
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,240
I may be able to get a head start

235
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,560
and win his trust.

236
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,200
Offer enlistment?

237
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,000
If Wang Jiubao agrees to the enlistment,

238
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,200
we'll give him a chance to live,

239
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,360
which will reduce banditry,

240
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,040
ease up the war,
and benefit our country.

241
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,480
If Wang Jiubao

242
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,760
really agrees to the enlistment,

243
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,760
maybe he can testify

244
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,400
that Marquis Jingyuan colluded with him.

245
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,440
That's right.

246
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,960
So I want to go to Nanjing

247
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,520
and look for his family.

248
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,720
But, My Lord,
do you have to go in person?

249
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm worried

250
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,000
that they'll try to harm you

251
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,280
if they know you are going.

252
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,520
No worries.

253
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,200
We've had a thorough plan

254
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,640
about how to rescue
Wang Jiubao's family.

255
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
And I've sent my people to Nanjing.

256
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,360
When the time's right,

257
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
we'll work together from
within and without.

258
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,480
As for Wang Jiubao,

259
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,960
If I save his family,

260
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,480
but he hurts me

261
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,680
or returns evil

262
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
for good,

263
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,040
he'll lose his prestige

264
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,280
even among the pirates.

265
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm sure he won't do that.

266
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,040
Then please be careful, My Lord.

267
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Marquis, you aren't here

268
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
this time just to return

269
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
my family, are you?

270
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,400
Mr. Wang, you can consider it

271
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,760
a small gesture from me.

272
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,600
I escorted your family back

273
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,400
because I was concerned
about their safety,

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,320
and I also wanted

275
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,320
to meet you in person.

276
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
You are going to offer me enlistment.

277
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,200
If I agree with it,

278
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,320
what's in it for me?

279
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,040
We can discuss about
your title and payment.

280
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,960
You can still lead your subordinates

281
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,360
and you don't have

282
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,800
to submit to Fujian Command Department.

283
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,800
You have your right
to make your own decisions.

284
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,480
So many benefits.

285
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,640
It sounds so enticing.

286
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,960
You are not satisfied?

287
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,160
I am.

288
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,120
How could I not be

289
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,480
when the benefits are this good?

290
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,200
But I don't believe you.

291
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,000
The people down there

292
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,720
used to be fishermen on the coast.

293
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,720
They became pirates
because they had no other choice.

294
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,080
Even so,

295
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,480
you court officials

296
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
still kidnapped my family

297
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,000
and forced me to surrender.

298
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
How can I trust

299
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,800
such a government?

300
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,760
I understand.

301
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,120
Hadn't been for the sea ban,

302
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,160
you wouldn't have lost your livelihood.

303
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,560
Hadn't been for
Marquis Jingyuan's iron hand,

304
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,960
you wouldn't have become pirates.

305
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
As long as you understand, Marquis.

306
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,280
I think you'd better figure out

307
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
how to help the people on the coast

308
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,120
to make a living.

309
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
Lift the sea ban.

310
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
What did you say?

311
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,160
The court is planning

312
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,720
on lifting the sea ban.

313
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,120
Once the sea ban is lifted,

314
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,960
the coastal people
can do business freely.

315
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,560
Even if I don't elaborate,

316
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm sure you know

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,360
how much they'll be benefited.

318
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,720
How can I trust you?

319
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,120
Please wait and see.

320
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,240
Alright.

321
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,560
Then let's reopen the conversation

322
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,320
when the court lifts the sea ban.

323
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,360
Servant.

324
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,920
Yes.

325
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
See Marquis Yongping off.

326
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,400
Marquis, please.

327
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,360
My Lord.

328
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,360
What did Wang Jiubao say?

329
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,880
He's been threatened by Marquis Jingyuan

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
so he doesn't trust people easily.

331
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,440
So does that mean
we came here for nothing?

332
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,800
Not necessarily.

333
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
They are just waiting.

334
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,240
If the sea ban is really lifted,

335
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,880
I'm sure

336
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,960
that they'll agree to our terms.

337
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
After all,

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,800
they just

339
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,000
want to survive.

340
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,260
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

341
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,360
That thing is worthless.

342
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,080
Come here.

343
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,040
Let me go.

344
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,840
Let go of me.

345
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,240
Let go.

346
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,800
Be careful.

347
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,760
What?

348
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,240
You steal from home for outsiders.

349
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,520
Don't you know it's wrong?

350
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm the heir of this mansion,

351
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,840
the future Duke Mao.

352
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Everything in this mansion

353
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,800
belongs to me.

354
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,360
I've done nothing wrong
giving my birth mother

355
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
my own stuff.

356
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,680
Alright.

357
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
You ungrateful little brat.

358
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,720
You don't even admit your mistake.

359
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,520
Servants.

360
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:32,960
Yes.

361
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,880
Take him to the ancestral hall

362
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,880
and punish him
according to our family rules.

363
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,120
Young Madam.

364
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,040
Please don't.

365
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,720
Jinlian.

366
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
It's none of your business.

367
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
He steals at such a young age.

368
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,040
What will he become when he grows up?

369
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,200
Today

370
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,720
I'll teach you a lesson.

371
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,840
Young Madam.

372
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,560
Young Madam. Come here.

373
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Young Madam.

374
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,200
Young Madam.

375
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
If you do that,

376
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,840
Lady Wang-Liu will get her way.

377
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,440
You punish him

378
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,480
right after Lady Wang-Liu left,

379
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,160
it'll push him

380
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,480
even closer to Lady Wang-Liu.

381
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,880
When he grows up

382
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,920
and becomes the Duke,

383
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:05,830
he'll

384
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,560
take you even less seriously.

385
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,280
So I'll just

386
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,480
let him steal from home?

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,070
Young Madam,

388
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,350
with all due respect,

389
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,760
he steals

390
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,350
because he wants
to help his birth mother.

391
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,000
It's understandable

392
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,720
that he cares about his birth mother.

393
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Young Madam,

394
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,310
why don't you just be more generous

395
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,640
and let him

396
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,310
send some money to Lady Wang-Liu?

397
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,400
It'll also

398
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,160
do good to you in the long run.

399
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,260
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

400
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,440
Young Madam,

401
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,280
I bought some

402
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,920
seasonal fruits on the street.

403
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,960
Please have a taste.

404
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,840
They are sweet.

405
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,280
Can't believe

406
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,600
that Marquis Yongping's Mansion

407
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
also sells fruits.

408
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
What a surprise.

409
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,320
Young... Young Madam,

410
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,440
what are you talking about?

411
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
Just tell the truth.

412
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,800
When did you

413
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,120
become one of Luo Shiyi's people?

414
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,920
Young Madam, you get me wrong.

415
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,880
Don't make excuses.

416
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,640
No wonder you've

417
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,880
become so smart lately.

418
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,440
Not only did you cure my illness,

419
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,960
you also had a way
to deal with Lady Wang-Liu

420
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,920
and take care of my son.

421
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,560
Looks like Shiyi

422
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,360
has taught you a lot.

423
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,840
Now, tell me.

424
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,200
What's your purpose

425
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,640
of doing those things?

426
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,720
Young Madam.

427
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,440
I didn't hide it from you

428
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,600
on purpose.

429
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Madam Xu wanted to offer you help,

430
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,520
but she's worried
that you wouldn't accept it,

431
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
so I've been keeping it a secret.

432
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
So Shiyi is really behind this.

433
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,040
She's such a busybody.

434
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,840
Young Madam,

435
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,760
Madam Xu doesn't mean any harm.

436
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,560
She said those mean words

437
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,840
because she saw that you were depressed

438
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,680
and she wanted you to
pull yourself together.

439
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,080
So she said those things

440
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
to encourage you.

441
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
And then she knew
that you were all by yourself

442
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,440
but you were too proud

443
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,160
to ask for any help,

444
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,080
so she taught me in secret

445
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,480
how to take care of you.

446
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,240
She'd help me?

447
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,840
Seeing me living in hell

448
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,640
must make her very happy.

449
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,120
Young Madam,

450
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,000
you really misunderstand Madam Xu.

451
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,160
In order to cure your illness,

452
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,800
she visited all the famous physicians
in the capital.

453
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
But she was worried that you wouldn't

454
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,120
accept the physician she introduced,

455
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
so she had the physician

456
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,840
make the pills specially for you

457
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,840
and asked me to bring it back
and let you take it.

458
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,440
She's also concerned
that you'd be bullied in the mansion,

459
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,440
so she taught me how to deal with it

460
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,400
and helped you go through
the difficulties.

461
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,240
If she's up to no good,

462
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,960
why would she bother

463
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,160
spending all the time helping you?

464
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,720
You made it sound like she's a saint.

465
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,600
She only wants to mock me.

466
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,960
Now

467
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,320
that she helped me,

468
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,000
who knows how she'll

469
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
make fun of me when she sees me.

470
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,480
Since you listen to her,

471
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
why don't you go to the Mansion of Xu?

472
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,480
I don't believe

473
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,880
that I can't survive

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,080
without you and Shiyi.

475
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,760
Young Madam.

476
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,760
It's not that you can't live without me.

477
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm the one who can't live without you.

478
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,440
I've been

479
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,600
serving you since I was little.

480
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
Everything I have

481
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
is given by you.

482
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,600
I'll be nothing

483
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,920
if I leave you, Young Madam.

484
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,440
I don't have anything,

485
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,640
you are the only one

486
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,880
I can rely on, Young Madam.

487
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,720
I don't want to go anywhere else.

488
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,560
Alright. Alright.

489
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,920
Stop crying.

490
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,040
If you don't want to leave,

491
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,400
I can't force you to.

492
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,280
In the future,

493
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,880
don't hide things from me anymore.

494
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I won't.

495
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,000
Thank you, Young Madam.

496
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,720
Let's pretend

497
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,320
nothing happened today.

498
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,440
From now on,

499
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,840
you can continue to do

500
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,960
whatever you think is right.

501
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,480
Yes.

502
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,400
Madam,

503
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,000
the flower you ordered has arrived.

504
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,040
Put it here.

505
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,480
Okay.

506
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,680
You can go back to work.

507
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,520
Although our plan failed eventually,

508
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,120
you protected yourself

509
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
and didn't arouse Xu Lingyi's suspicion.

510
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,800
You are quite smart.

511
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,680
Don't know

512
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,400
what you call me over for

513
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,800
this time.

514
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,000
I want you

515
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,360
to alienate Xu Lingyi and Luo Shiyi.

516
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
They love each other a lot.

517
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,960
I'm afraid it's not easy to be done.

518
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,560
Don't forget

519
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,320
that you came to me first.

520
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,840
If you can't even do this for me,

521
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,960
how can you take revenge
on the Xu family?

522
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,960
You'd better forget about it.

523
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,720
I'll never forget

524
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,320
the pain they caused me.

525
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
Official Ou, don't worry.

526
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,840
I will do my best

527
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,560
and I won't let you down.

528
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,600
There's a man whose last name is Lin

529
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,440
in Xianling Pavilion.

530
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,440
Do you know him?

531
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,720
Lin?

532
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,440
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

533
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,160
My Lord.

534
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,200
How did you get hurt?

535
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,960
It's him.

536
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,840
He's a painter,

537
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
as well as one of
the owners of Xianling Pavilion.

538
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
A painter?

539
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,160
When did the second Young Master

540
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,920
of the Ou family become a painter?

541
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,200
He's one of the Ou family?

542
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,040
Her Ladyship is doing business

543
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,200
with a member of the Ou family?

544
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,720
Not only is he one of the Ou family,

545
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,960
he's also quite close

546
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,200
to Madam Xu.

547
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,280
His Majesty orders Prince Yu

548
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
to treat all officials a banquet
on the Beginning of Autumn.

549
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,440
I will put you

550
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,480
and Madam Xu

551
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,160
on the invitation list.

552
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,680
And it's up to you

553
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,160
to make the best use of this thing.

554
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,880
My Lord, you are back.

555
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,440
Don't tell anybody yet.

(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

585
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,480
My Lord, how was your trip?

586
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,840
I've freed Wang Jiubao's family

587
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,880
from Marquis Jingyuan.

588
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,440
Wang Jiubao is not a threat
to me anymore.

589
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,320
Though he hasn't
agreed with the enlistment,

590
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm certain

591
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,200
that once the sea ban is lifted,

592
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,800
he will surrender to us.

593
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,000
This is not something
that we can rush through.

594
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,240
It's already

595
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,320
a good start.

596
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,760
General Fu.

597
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,480
I'm here to see His Lordship.

598
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,360
I'll go and report.

599
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,120
Okay.

600
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,280
My Lord,

601
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,280
General Fu is here.

602
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,040
My Lord.

603
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,280
Linbo.

604
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,160
I made some notes

605
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
during my Fujian trip.

606
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,320
And I want Fan Weigang to review them.

607
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,640
It's an important matter.

608
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,960
Please give them to him in person.

609
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,440
Yes.

610
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,880
Your Ladyship,
the belt you made for His Lordship

611
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,760
is so pretty.

612
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,640
The pattern is featured by clouds,

613
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
which look so lifelike.

614
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,600
His Lordship doesn't like

615
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,000
those fancy patterns,

616
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,880
so I embroidered clouds and rivers,

617
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,720
which are low-key

618
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
but quite elegant.

619
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,120
You know what I like

620
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,320
even better than I do.

621
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,640
If you like it,

622
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,920
you should get married.

623
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,600
Hope I can also have such luck.

624
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,280
My Lord,

625
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,920
if there's nothing else,

626
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,120
I'll leave now.

627
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,240
By the way, Dongqing,

628
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
I found some old stuff,

629
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,960
please help me sort it out later.

630
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,160
Yes, Your Ladyship.

631
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,720
General Fu, you are...

632
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Come with me.

633
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,040
Why are you bringing me here?

634
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,000
Just follow me.

635
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,200
You'll know very soon.

636
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,720
Sit down.

637
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,720
Take it.

638
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,480
What's this?

639
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,320
I came across a famous physician

640
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,480
on my way back.

641
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,960
This is a special medicine he made.

642
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
It's said that if you apply it

643
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,640
on your wound,

644
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,280
there won't be any scar left.

645
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
Don't get me wrong.

646
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,440
I didn't look for it

647
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,280
on purpose.

648
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,400
I just met him

649
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,400
by chance.

650
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,040
Then, thank you for the medicine,
General Fu.

651
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,600
And thank you

652
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,760
for saving me last time.

653
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,320
You...

654
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
You won't

655
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,680
just verbally

656
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,040
thank me, will you?

657
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,440
I do think

658
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,720
that I'm a

659
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
lucky person.

660
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,240
What do you think?

661
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,560
How would I know?

662
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,840
I still have things to do.

663
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,520
I have to go.

664
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,120
Your Ladyship,
the belt you made for His Lordship

665
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,120
is so pretty.

666
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,800
The pattern is featured by clouds,

667
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,960
which look so lifelike.

668
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,240
He made quite a puzzle for me.

669
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,600
How can my skills compare

670
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,000
to Her Ladyship's?

671
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Fortunately, I have this belt

672
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,440
as a reference.

673
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,160
Isn't that His Lordship's belt?

674
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,000
It's not.

675
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,480
You saw it wrong.

676
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,440
(If she knows it's His Lordship's belt,)

677
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,920
(I'll never hear the end of it.)

678
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,440
Amber,

679
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,160
you used to wear

680
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,040
this Buddha-bead bracelet

681
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,960
all the time.

682
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,040
You told me

683
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,600
it can help you find your sister.

684
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,600
Why do you stop

685
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,760
wearing it recently?

686
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,880
Buddha's mind should be kept pure.

687
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
But I had some improper thoughts.

688
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,320
I no longer deserve

689
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,200
wearing it.

690
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
But I will

691
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,680
never forget what

692
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
this bracelet represents.

693
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,080
What improper thoughts?

694
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
What no longer deserve?

695
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,880
What are you talking about?

696
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,480
I don't think I follow.

697
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,800
Dongqing.

698
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,920
Take a look at
this Buddha-bead bracelet.

699
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,480
It's made of a rare material,

700
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
and every bead is carefully carved.

701
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,440
Its value

702
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,560
is way beyond what a maid

703
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,080
can imagine.

704
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,360
Only those high-ranking people

705
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,560
deserve having it.

706
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,080
Do you understand?

707
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,200
But Her Ladyship told me

708
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,160
that there's no such thing

709
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,880
as noble or low status.

710
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,600
Although I'm a maid,

711
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,280
I'm only

712
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,760
doing my job

713
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,120
and paid for what I do.

714
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,880
It doesn't mean

715
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,040
that I'm inferior to the others.

716
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,720
No matter how valuable this bracelet is,

717
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,120
since it belongs to you,

718
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,120
it must do for a reason.

719
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,760
I really don't get it.

720
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,560
The others haven't

721
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,400
said anything,

722
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,960
yet you already
started belittling yourself.

723
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,120
Dongqing,

724
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
Her Ladyship is kind,

725
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,600
but it doesn't mean
the others are the same.

726
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,600
If you don't get a clear

727
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,800
understanding of who you are

728
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,800
and stop thinking

729
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,280
about the things
that don't belong to you,

730
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,960
you'll get hurt.

731
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,440
What am I thinking about?

732
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,680
Stop talking nonsense.

733
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,760
You are

734
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,520
so spoiled by Her Ladyship.

735
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,480
It's already late.

736
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
Why are you still up, Amber?

737
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,840
I can't sleep.

738
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,880
Tomorrow

739
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,920
is my sister's birthday.

740
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,840
Her Ladyship has sent people

741
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,320
to find out your sister's whereabouts.

742
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,280
There's just no

743
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,960
reliable information yet.

744
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,040
I know Her Ladyship is doing her best.

745
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,360
I just feel sorry

746
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,040
that the fate has separated
my sister and me.

747
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,520
I don't expect to get together

748
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,640
with her anymore.

749
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
I just hope

750
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,840
that she's still

751
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
safe and alive in this world.

752
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,800
The pomegranate trees are fruiting.

753
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,200
The flowers are beautiful, too.

754
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,120
Who lost her handkerchief here?

755
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,440
So strange.

756
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,720
It's not

757
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,680
an intact lotus embroidery,

758
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,120
but only half.

759
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,280
Why did you put it

760
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,760
together with the pouch?

761
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,680
Of course it'd fall out

762
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
when you reach the pouch.

763
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,560
It's a big mansion.

764
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
How are we supposed to find it?

765
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,800
I found it.

766
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,880
It's just an embroidery handkerchief.

767
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,800
My sister gave it to me.

768
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,710
Then you should keep it well
in the future.

769
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,230
Let's go.

770
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm so thirsty after the long walk.

771
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,670
Go ahead and brew some tea.

772
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,600
Yes.

773
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,120
What...

774
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,720
What do you mean?

775
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,240
Shiliu, you know

776
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
that I have a younger sister.

777
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,720
I separated with my sister
when we were little.

778
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,480
And this handkerchief

779
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,440
is the only object
that can bring us back together.

780
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,480
In this house,

781
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,200
you are the one

782
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,520
who I trust the most.

783
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,280
In the future,

784
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,400
if you meet a girl

785
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,520
who has the other

786
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,400
half of the handkerchief,

787
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,120
please do me a favor
and treat her nicely.

788
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,200
Biyu.

789
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,640
What's going on?

790
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,440
Do you a favor?

791
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,040
Why don't you keep it and give it

792
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,360
to her yourself in the future?

793
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,640
Biyu.

794
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,480
Biyu.

795
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
Your spirit is still with us.

796
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,720
You even sent me

797
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
such a big gift

798
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,320
at this

799
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,600
critical moment.

800
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,880
Don't worry.

801
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
I will find justice

802
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,560
for you

803
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
and for myself.

804
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,160
You've all got to be careful.

805
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,000
These are for the memorial ceremony

806
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,960
for the late Marquis

807
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,760
and Master Ling'an.

808
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,520
Yes.

809
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,840
Madam, Concubine Qin is here.

810
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,880
Second Madam.

811
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,600
Shiliu, what brought

812
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,440
you here?

813
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,640
The orchids

814
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,000
are blooming these days.

815
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,520
I know you like them,

816
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,160
so I brought some for you.

817
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,280
Thank you.

818
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,400
You are very thoughtful.

819
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,520
Please sit down.

820
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,320
You are painting?

821
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,520
Looks like I picked
a good timing to be here.

822
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,640
May I have the honor

823
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,240
to have one of your paintings?

824
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,960
My paintings

825
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,760
are not that good.

826
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,200
In a few days,

827
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,560
it'll be the anniversary of Ling'an

828
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,880
and the late Marquis's death.

829
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,440
When Ling'an went into battles,

830
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,640
he always sent me bamboo paintings

831
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
to let me know that he was safe.

832
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,240
Therefore, on every anniversary
of his death,

833
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,720
I'd paint bamboo

834
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
in memory of him

835
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,280
and to appease his spirit in heaven.

836
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,480
Unfortunately, I'm not good at painting.

837
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,000
Though I've practiced for years,

838
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,320
I still haven't mastered the key skills,

839
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,920
which really bothers me.

840
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,840
Master Ling'an was well-versed
in art and martial arts.

841
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,320
He was indeed a hero.

842
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,640
It's such a pity

843
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,160
that he died young.

844
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,440
As a man, it's not a pity

845
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,600
for him to die on the battlefield.

846
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,800
What's unfair

847
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,080
is that Ling'an and the late Marquis

848
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,560
were dead because the Ou family

849
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,800
set them up.

850
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,840
If the Ou family had sent out the troops

851
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,040
and offered reinforcement,

852
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,280
they wouldn't have been
trapped in the city

853
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,720
and died with hatred.

854
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,920
Sorry I said the wrong words.

855
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,400
Please forgive me.

856
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,240
I just remembered

857
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,560
there's a painter in Xianling Pavilion
whose last name is Lin.

858
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,720
He's an excellent artist

859
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,080
and especially good at painting bamboo.

860
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,760
If you don't mind

861
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,800
having someone else paint it for you,

862
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,320
you can pay him a visit.

863
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,320
In that case, I can

864
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
ask Shiyi

865
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,720
to help me talk to him.

866
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,120
On my way over here,

867
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,080
I saw Her Ladyship leading the servants

868
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,080
to prepare for the memorial ceremony.

869
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
They are very busy.

870
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,640
I'm afraid Her Ladyship

871
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,440
won't be available for days.

872
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,760
Madam,

873
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,760
why don't we go by ourselves?

874
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,520
It could be fun taking a walk outside.

875
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,440
Alright.

876
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,880
Then let's do it.

877
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,560
Here you go.

878
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,140
(Account Book)

879
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,840
Mr. Ou, I've

880
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,000
checked your account book.

881
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,560
Today is the 10th.

882
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,120
I knew you'd come.

883
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,320
So I've had it prepared.

884
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,520
Now that the account book is checked,

885
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,600
I'll no longer have connection
with Xianling Pavilion.

886
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,000
Mr. Ou, I'll be upset

887
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,280
if you put it this way.

888
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,760
You don't even

889
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,520
see me as your friend anymore?

890
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,160
Master Jian, I admire your determination

891
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
of passing on the embroidery skills.

892
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,680
No matter what,

893
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,200
you are always

894
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
my good friend.

895
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,840
And I'm really grateful

896
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,200
for everything you've done

897
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,680
for Xianling Pavilion, for me

898
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,960
and for Shiyi.

899
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,160
Master Jian,

900
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,640
you have a visitor.

901
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,360
Master Jian, please go ahead.

902
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,640
We can talk later.

903
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,360
Okay.

904
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,840
I'll be back soon.

905
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Madam,

906
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,880
is there anything I can help?

907
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I heard

908
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,760
that there's a Master Lin in this store
who's very good at painting.

909
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,760
The bamboo he paints
looks strong and delicate.

910
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,160
It's filled with upright
and unyielding spirit.

911
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
So I'm here today,
hoping he can paint one for me.

912
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,560
Would you please introduce him to me?

913
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,640
I won't call myself a Master.

914
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,640
I only paint

915
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,080
the bamboo for fun.

916
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,880
Madam, you are flattering me.

917
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,360
So you are Master Lin.

918
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,640
Sorry I didn't know.

919
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,440
Alright.

920
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,000
Madam, please give me a moment.

921
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,920
It's so pretty.

922
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,120
Very nice brush stroke techniques.

923
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,800
And the painting looks
full of power and elegance.

924
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,520
You are an excellent artist indeed.

925
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,080
I'm so impressed.

926
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,120
I'm flattered.

927
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm wondering how much
I owe you for this painting.

928
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,320
Though I paint,

929
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,160
I don't do it for a living.

930
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,360
Since you like

931
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
my work,

932
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,640
I can give it to you for free.

933
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,920
I just hope that you can support

934
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,280
Xianling Pavilion's business
in the future.

935
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,200
Of course.

936
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,920
I still have things to do.

937
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,520
Sorry I can't stay here for long.

938
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,880
See you.

939
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,880
Thank you very much.
