167
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,880
I'll have breakfast with you

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,080
every day.

169
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,280
Then I'll walk you out
to attend the morning court.

170
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Okay.

171
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Why do you keep smiling at me?

172
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,200
Is there anything strange on my face?

173
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,840
There are characters on your face.

174
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,760
Right here.

175
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,960
It reads His Lordship is so nice.

176
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,640
Dongqing!

177
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,600
Stop it! Stop it please!

178
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,480
Sorry! Sorry!

179
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,320
You keep pulling a long face

180
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,200
and declining me with
all kinds of excuses.

181
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,920
That seems to be Master Lingkuan's

182
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,680
Concubine Lan.

183
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
Now you can't even be scolded?

184
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
You can't win Master Lingkuan over

185
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,600
because you're not capable.

186
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,120
Let's go and have a look.

187
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,200
Don't vent your anger on me.

188
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,920
You!

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,120
Don't you dare say that again!

190
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,720
I...

191
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,640
What are you quarreling about?

192
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,440
-Your Ladyship.
-Your Ladyship.

193
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
You usually treat each other as sisters.

194
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,680
Just talk things through.

195
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,760
Sisters?

196
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,280
Since she became the concubine,

197
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,080
she's been bossy to me

198
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,480
and treating me like a maid.

199
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
There is no sisterhood left.

200
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,480
Your Ladyship,

201
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,480
have you heard her?

202
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,320
Your Ladyship, please be the judge.

203
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,120
It was Fifth Madam

204
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,760
who sent her to serve me.

205
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,120
I just scolded her a little bit.

206
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,640
How dare she talk back?

207
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,720
You were actually
mad at Master Lingkuan

208
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,800
for not staying last night.

209
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
You dare not blame him,

210
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,160
so you picked on me instead.

211
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,560
How dare you talk to me like that?

212
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,120
I'll teach you

213
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,800
a lesson today!

214
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,400
Enough!

215
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,840
Are you done?

216
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,000
If anything goes wrong,

217
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,960
you'll be severely punished
according to the rules of the Xu family.

218
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,280
If there's nothing else,

219
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,200
you may go back.

220
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,560
Yes.

221
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,120
Your Ladyship,

222
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,240
Fifth Madam sent Xiaodie
to serve Xiaolan

223
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,040
out of kindness.

224
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,360
Unexpectedly,

225
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,880
they're hostile to each other now.

226
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm afraid

227
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,280
this is what Princess Danyang

228
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,480
really wants to see.

229
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Shiyi,

230
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
have a look.

231
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,160
It's so cute.

232
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
You're going to give birth.

233
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,240
Stop doing these things.

234
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,800
I'll help you with these.

235
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,840
Don't laugh at

236
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
my poor embroidery skills.

237
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
After all,

238
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,680
this is what a mother

239
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,920
should do.

240
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,120
It's pretty.

241
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,400
It's really pretty.

242
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Shiyi,

243
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,120
just say it if you
have something to say.

244
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,680
On my way here just now,

245
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,960
I saw Concubine Lan

246
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
quarreling with Xiaodie.

247
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,080
Princess Danyang,

248
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
if you feel wronged,

249
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,840
please don't keep it to yourself.

250
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I wonder whether you
have talked about it

251
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,640
with Lingkuan or not.

252
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,680
Actually, you can really

253
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,640
try talking with him

254
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,080
openly and honestly.

255
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,840
If you keep those
bad feelings to yourself

256
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,400
and do something evil,

257
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm afraid it'll harm your relationship

258
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,680
in the future.

259
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,680
Shiyi, what do you mean?

260
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,000
Lingkuan treats me so well.

261
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,360
How can I feel wronged

262
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
or do anything evil?

263
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,760
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

264
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,280
Well, I've got something
personal to attend to.

265
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
I won't keep you up.

266
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,560
You're pregnant.

267
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,760
No need to stand up.

268
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,160
Shiyi, see you.

269
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,110
Your Ladyship, you mean

270
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,310
Fifth Madam deliberately sent Xiaodie

271
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,590
to serve Concubine Lan

272
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,160
so as to

273
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,400
intensify their conflicts.

274
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
It seems that

275
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,360
Princess Danyang is not going to stop.

276
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,720
Send someone to keep an eye on

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,600
Concubine Lan and Xiaodie

278
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,960
in case anything goes wrong.

279
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,720
Danyang.

280
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,680
Lingkuan.

281
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
I heard the maid said that

282
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,160
Shiyi came to visit you.

283
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,720
I made some clothes for our baby,

284
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,720
so I specially invited Shiyi
over to have a look at them.

285
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,280
It was late when you
came back last night.

286
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,280
I thought

287
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,080
you had run into trouble outside.

288
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
I was worried about
you the whole night.

289
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,560
This morning,

290
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
I heard Nanny Shi said that

291
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,400
last night

292
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
you had dinner

293
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,800
at Xiaolan's place.

294
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,120
Xiaolan sent someone to tell me that

295
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,560
you've been feeling bored
and unhappy recently,

296
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,360
so she's come up with an idea
to cheer you up.

297
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,560
I didn't stay long at her place.

298
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,200
I left right after I finished dinner.

299
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,360
If you feel unhappy,

300
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,880
I'll never go to her place again.

301
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm not that narrow-minded.

302
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,600
Why would I get jealous of

303
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
a concubine?

304
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Be careful.

305
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,940
(Qian's Dried Fruit Shop)

306
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,120
Be careful. Be careful.

307
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,680
Come on. Put it here.

308
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,760
Have a look! Have a look!

309
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
It's all right.

310
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,480
We only closed the shop.

311
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,760
Now that the business is bad,

312
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,920
it's better to give it up.

313
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,880
After the baby is born,

314
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,360
we can think of another way.

315
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,360
But we've borrowed money

316
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,960
from my sister-in-law and Shiyi.

317
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
We should at least pay them back.

318
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,960
You don't have to
worry about the money.

319
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll figure it out.

320
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,740
(Mansion of Xu)

321
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,320
My Lord.

322
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,720
What are you looking at?

323
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,320
You're so focused.

324
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,760
I heard that
Wuniang's Dried Fruit Shop

325
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,200
was closed due to bad management,

326
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,880
and they lost a lot of money.

327
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,720
Then let's visit her some other day.

328
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,360
We can take more money with us

329
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,400
to help her operate the business.

330
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
That's what worries me.

331
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,640
She has kept it from me.

332
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,800
I guess she didn't tell me the truth

333
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,120
because she feels sorry
that she can't pay me back.

334
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,640
If I visit her with money,

335
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,840
I might hurt her dignity.

336
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,040
You're really thoughtful.

337
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,360
But her husband

338
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,320
is preparing for the Spring Test
in two years

339
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
and he also has no income.

340
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Moreover,

341
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,600
the country estates Wuniang got as
her dowries is surrounded by sandy soil,

342
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,720
and what it produces
can't even afford the land tax.

343
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm afraid they won't be able to

344
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,000
live a comfortable life in the future.

345
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,760
I want to help them,

346
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
but I don't know how.

347
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,280
Sandy soil.

348
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,000
Different types of soil

349
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,720
are fit for different crops.

350
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,160
There are certain rules to apply.

351
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,960
Well,

352
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,440
I'll send Steward Bai

353
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,120
to check the land

354
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
some other day.

355
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
There will be a way out.

356
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,800
It seems that

357
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,760
whatever the problem is,

358
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,240
you can solve it.

359
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,680
With you by my side,

360
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,320
it's really reassuring.

361
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,280
I feel the same.

362
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Well,

363
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,440
it's such a big thing
to close your shop.

364
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
Why didn't you tell me?

365
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
How could you close the shop

366
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,680
without thinking carefully?

367
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,520
My husband and I

368
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
are not cut out for doing business.

369
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,240
By closing the shop,

370
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,240
we can cut the loss.

371
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,520
However...

372
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
Actually, I'm here today

373
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,240
to discuss it with you.

374
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,040
Previously, I borrowed money

375
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,240
from you and our sister-in-law.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,840
I will have to pay you back later.

377
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,080
Wuniang,

378
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
stop it, please.

379
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I agreed to invest in the shop.

380
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,800
How can I ask you to pay me back

381
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,520
when the shop is closed?

382
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,960
Don't say that.

383
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,680
Well,

384
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,680
though the shop is closed,
don't lose heart.

385
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,560
I've got good news for you.

386
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,640
What news?

387
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,200
His Lordship has sent someone to check

388
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,920
the country estates as your dowries.

389
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,520
It is perfectly fit
for growing melons.

390
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
I've done the math for you.

391
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,400
According to previous harvests

392
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,280
and market prices,

393
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,240
cost excluded,

394
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,280
you can still have

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,040
tens of tael of silver
left every year.

396
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,600
Moreover,

397
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,480
the farmers responsible
for tilling the land

398
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,800
are ready to work.

399
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,600
You just have to say "Yes".

400
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,240
I...

401
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm really

402
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,600
out of my words.

403
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,040
My mother-in-law

404
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
is coming to take care of me.

405
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,240
I was really worried

406
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
we can't make ends meet

407
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,720
in this case.

408
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,320
And you just solved the problem.

409
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,920
You...

410
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,120
Well,

411
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,480
how can I thank you?

412
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,320
Wuniang, by saying that,

413
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
you're not treating me as your sister.

414
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,560
Right? My little nephew.

415
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,360
Slow down!

416
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,400
Slow down!

417
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,920
Madam.

418
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,400
Slow down! Slow down! Be careful!

419
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,080
What are you waiting for?

420
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,680
Go and do your work!

421
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,880
-Got it!
-Got it!

422
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,920
Uh... What...

423
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
What has happened?

424
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,680
Fifth Madam,

425
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,200
Concubine Lan has fallen
into the water.

426
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,920
It seemed that

427
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
she was pushed into the water

428
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,120
by her maid Xiaodie.

429
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,120
After hearing us calling out for help,

430
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,520
she ran away.

431
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,000
How could this happen?

432
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
How is Concubine Lan now?

433
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,760
I...I'm afraid she might not make it.

434
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Is...is she dead?

435
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
How could this be?

436
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Nanny Shi,

437
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,640
how could this be?

438
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,760
Xiaolan will be okay.

439
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,680
Madam, Xiaolan will be okay.

440
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,760
Madam!

441
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
Madam!

442
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,280
Madam, let's go back!

443
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,840
Have it sent to

444
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,960
Wuniang.

445
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,920
The country estates will be fine

446
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,600
if they're operated according to this.

447
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,680
Yes, Your Ladyship.

448
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,120
Your Ladyship, bad news!

449
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,040
Fifth Madam was terrified.

450
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm afraid she's going to give birth.

451
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
What has happened?

452
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Xiaodie pushed Concubine Lan

453
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,160
into the pond.

454
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,520
How is Concubine Lan doing now?

455
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
Luckily, you've sent someone
to watch over her.

456
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
She was found relatively in time.

457
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,680
Now she's rescued onshore,

458
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,520
but no one knows

459
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,720
whether she can make it or not.

460
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,440
Send for the physician immediately.

461
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,080
Concubine Lan must be saved.

462
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,080
I'll go and see Danyang now.

463
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,040
How's Princess Danyang?

464
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,120
Is the midwife here?

465
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,040
Your Ladyship,

466
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
the midwife is in the room.

467
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,840
She said that
Fifth Madam was so terrified that

468
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,280
she might have a difficult labor.

469
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,360
-Your Ladyship.
-Madam, push hard!

470
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:58,960
Water.

471
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,040
Danyang!

472
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I'm here with you!

473
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,040
You'll be fine!

474
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,240
You'll be safe!

475
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,440
Shiyi!

476
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,120
Master Lingkuan!

477
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,120
Men can't go inside

478
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,560
the delivery room!

479
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,120
Danyang is at risk!

480
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,640
I don't care!

481
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,760
I want to accompany her!

482
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,800
Master Lingkuan!

483
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,640
-Master Lingkuan!
-Master Lingkuan!

484
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,760
Why are you here?

485
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,240
Danyang, I'm here!

486
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,000
Don't be afraid.

487
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
You'll be fine!

488
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,160
I...

489
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,040
I don't want to see you.

490
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,320
Get out!

491
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Get out!

492
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,320
Danyang!

493
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,440
Danyang!

494
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,440
-Madam, push harder!
-Danyang!

495
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,560
No! No!

496
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,840
We can't let her pass out!

497
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
Otherwise, we'll lose them both!

498
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,760
Hurry up! Hurry up!

499
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,240
-Danyang!
-Madam!

500
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,120
Danyang! Wake up!

501
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,240
-Your Ladyship!
-Madam!

502
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,760
Danyang!

503
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,960
Your Ladyship!

504
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,920
She's alive!

505
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,360
Concubine Lan is alive!

506
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,160
Danyang, have you heard that?

507
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,320
Concubine Lan is alive!

508
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Danyang, wake up!

509
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,600
-Danyang!
-Wake up!

510
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,700
Danyang!

511
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,340
-Danyang!
-Danyang!

512
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,200
-Danyang!
-Danyang!

513
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,880
Well,

514
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,640
how come Danyang suddenly

515
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,160
has a difficult labor?

516
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,080
How's she doing now?

517
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,400
Mother, don't worry.

518
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,760
Danyang is blessed.

519
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
She's sure to be fine.

520
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,640
Amitabha.

521
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,720
Please bless Danyang

522
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
and keep her and her baby safe.

523
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,080
Amitabha. Amitabha.

524
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,720
Amitabha.

525
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Great Madam, good news!

526
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,760
We've had another young master!

527
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Both the mother and son are safe!

528
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,760
-Great!
-Great!

529
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,240
Great! Let's go and see them.

530
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,560
Your Ladyship.

531
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,920
Fifth Madam's son

532
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,080
is really cute.

533
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,000
He's got phoenix eyes,

534
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,360
just like Master Lingkuan.

535
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,440
Luckily, it turned out good.

536
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,880
Danyang and her baby are both safe.

537
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,680
After this incident,

538
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,320
I suppose Master Lingkuan

539
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
will behave.

540
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,920
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

541
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,520
His Lordship is not
as muddled as Master Lingkuan.

542
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,480
He won't

543
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,560
make you feel wronged.

544
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,680
I know.

545
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
His Lordship treats me sincerely.

546
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,120
I'm already contented.

547
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,640
My Lord!

548
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,960
My Lord!

549
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,400
I just went to see the baby.

550
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
He's sweet-faced and chubby,
and he's really cute.

551
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,160
Lingkuan asked me
to thank you on his behalf.

552
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,400
He said that thanks to you,

553
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,320
Danyang and her son can be safe.

554
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,480
Well,

555
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,880
the person he should really thank

556
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,240
is Danyang.

557
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
She has suffered a lot.

558
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,080
Right.

559
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,360
Danyang surely has suffered a lot,

560
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,360
but you've also contributed a lot.

561
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,440
My Lord, that being said,

562
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,320
how will you thank me?

563
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,720
Then I'll give you a baby

564
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,680
as the reward.

565
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,200
My Lord,

566
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,960
is this reward for me

567
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,880
or for you?

568
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,680
Fine.

569
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,520
Well, in this case,

570
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,800
we'll have two,

571
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,640
three,

572
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,880

(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

592
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,200
My Lord.

593
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,480
Dongqing,

594
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,000
take good care of her.

595
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,480
Talk to her more often.

596
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,800
Whatever she needs,

597
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,480
feel free to ask Steward Bai for it.

598
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes, My Lord!

599
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,640
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

600
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,000
My Lord, let me walk you out!

601
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,680
He's so cute!

602
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,040
Look at his eyes.

603
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,240
I can tell he's a member of the Xu
family simply by looking at his eyes.

604
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,120
Be careful.

605
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Shiyi, in fact,

606
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,760
I have to thank you this time.

607
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,040
If you hadn't taken early precautions

608
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,720
to save Xiaolan

609
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
and stayed by my side the whole time,

610
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,520
I might have...

611
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,800
Princess Danyang, you're blessed.

612
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Please call me Danyang in the future.

613
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
From today on,

614
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
you're my best friend

615
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,240
and closest kin.

616
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,720
If anyone dares bully you,

617
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
I'll make them suffer.

618
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,040
You really didn't

619
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
take me seriously before.

620
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,000
Madam, Concubine Lan is here.

621
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,240
Why is she here?

622
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,000
She...

623
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,000
Madam,

624
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,120
Her Ladyship said

625
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,440
it was you who had me saved.

626
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,160
Thank you

627
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,320
for saving my life.

628
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,680
Just leave.

629
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,240
I don't want to see you.

630
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,600
Madam,

631
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,200
I narrowly escaped death.

632
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,360
I feel so grateful to you,

633
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,680
and I feel guilty of

634
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
my past mistakes.

635
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,600
I'm here today

636
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,120
to tell you that

637
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,160
Master Lingkuan

638
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,920
has never slept with me.

639
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
I knew that

640
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,360
after Master Lingkuan got drunk,

641
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,200
he would remember nothing,

642
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,400
so I deliberately
made him misunderstand

643
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,560
out of selfishness.

644
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,360
Are you telling

645
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,280
the truth?

646
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,040
I'm still

647
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,640
a virgin.

648
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
So I've wronged him

649
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,480
all the time.

650
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,000
Madam, Master Lingkuan is here.

651
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,200
Unable to eat or sleep these few days,

652
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
he has pined away.

653
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,840
He must be suffering inside.

654
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,600
You should comfort him.

655
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,840
Danyang,

656
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,960
how do you feel?

657
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,440
Do you feel unwell?

658
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,680
I'm so useless.

659
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,840
Not only am I good for nothing,

660
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
but I make you worry all the time.

661
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,800
You even have to answer for

662
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,600
the mistake I've made.

663
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,000
Danyang,

664
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,560
I don't blame you for hating me.

665
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,240
What are you doing?

666
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,480
You silly!

667
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,480
All you know is to admit mistakes,

668
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
but you don't know that

669
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,360
you've been tricked.

670
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,040
What do you mean by that?

671
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,240
Xiaolan just told me that

672
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,040
you were only drunk that night,

673
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
and you didn't sleep with her.

674
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,480
She tricked you

675
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,080
because you were drunk.

676
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,200
So,

677
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,080
she's been lying to us the whole time!

678
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,840
Danyang, great!

679
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,600
I didn't do

680
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,800
anything unfaithful to you!

681
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,440
I didn't fail you!

682
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
Sorry, Lingkuan.

683
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,040
It's all my fault!

684
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,480
Not only did I harm our relationship,

685
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,080
but I almost lost our baby!

686
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
It's all my fault!

687
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,400
Danyang,

688
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,680
it's all in the past.

689
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,200
Let's forget about it.

690
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,560
We'll live our life happily

691
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,000
just like before,

692
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,640
okay?

693
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,080
I will never doubt you.

694
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,150
Xiaolan is really hateful

695
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,400
for lying to us for so long.

696
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,440
I'll send her away

697
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,710
to the country estate right away.

698
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,880
Xiaodie should also
be sent to the government

699
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,480
for attempted murder.

700
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,000
But if she hadn't told me the truth,

701
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,280
I would have still misunderstood you.

702
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Her merit has offset her fault.

703
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,360
Also,

704
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,150
I've done some bad things to her.

705
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,440
How about this?

706
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,320
Give them the indentures

707
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,230
plus some money,

708
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,800
and ask them to leave this place.

709
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,320
Okay.

710
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll do as you say.

711
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,520
It's all my fault.

712
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,230
You've done nothing wrong.

713
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,720
My wife is kind and generous,

714
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
understanding and reasonable,

715
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,320
not afraid to love and hate,

716
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,320
and of exquisite beauty.

717
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,640
Stop it!

718
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,880
I call you back this time

719
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,880
to discuss

720
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,360
how to help Erniang.

721
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,480
Jinlian wrote back

722
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,000
saying that Erniang
has been bed-ridden

723
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,440
these days.

724
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,480
I've sent people
to visit her several times,

725
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,760
but she never let them in.

726
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,680
I wonder how she's doing now.

727
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,000
Last time I saw her,

728
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,760
she looked terrible.

729
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,760
I didn't know she is so ill.

730
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,560
But she is

731
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,240
so stubborn.

732
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,920
Even if we want to help her,

733
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,760
she may not accept it.
What should we do?

734
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,560
Master Zhenxing, Jinlian is here.

735
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,640
Young Master Luo. Young Madam Luo.

736
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,800
Jinlian,

737
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
why are you here?

738
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,560
Is there anything wrong with Erniang?

739
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,480
Young Madam Luo,

740
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,880
Young Madam is severely ill.

741
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,720
Now with all her hopes gone,

742
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,240
she only wishes to die,

743
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,920
so she has kicked me out.

744
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,000
She said that I'm a maid
from the Luo family.

745
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,800
Now that she didn't need me anymore,

746
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,840
she surely should return me
to the Luo family.

747
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,160
She also said that
whatever happens to me,

748
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,200
it's none of her business.

749
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
How could this happen?

750
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
Young Master Luo. Young Madam Luo.

751
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,240
Young Madam really

752
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
has no other option.

753
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,520
Now all the family affairs

754
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,920
are controlled by Lady Wang-Liu,

755
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,320
the birth mother of
the new heir of Duck Mao.

756
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,000
She is cruel

757
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,520
and treats Young Madam harshly.

758
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,480
She kicked me out

759
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,800
to prevent Lady Wang-Liu

760
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,760
from giving me away

761
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,280
to an old widower.

762
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,480
What about Duke Mao and Madam Wang?

763
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,440
Do they just

764
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,800
let her do these?

765
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Since late heir of Duck Mao passed away,

766
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,880
he has dedicated
himself to cultivation.

767
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,400
He no longer cares
about the family affairs.

768
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,120
Madam Wang is also severely ill.

769
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,600
All her servants

770
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,800
are arranged by Lady Wang-Liu.

771
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,720
We can't see her

772
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,240
at all.

773
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,360
Now, I'm afraid

774
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,280
there's not a single servant

775
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,280
around Young Madam
to take care of her.

776
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,640
Unbelievable!

777
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,280
I'll go to the Wang family right away.

778
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,960
I'd like to see

779
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,360
what that woman will do!

780
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,480
Zhenxing!

781
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Zhenxing! Sister-in-law!

782
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,840
I'll go.

783
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,640
It's easier for us sisters

784
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,880
to discuss it.

785
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,320
Okay.

786
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,400
You go first.

787
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,840
Keep me informed if anything happens.

788
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,760
I'll go with you.

789
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,700
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

790
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,520
Jinlian.

791
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,880
It turns out

792
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,200
you're out to seek for help.

793
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,640
But now it's inconvenient

794
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,640
for Young Madam to receive visitors.

795
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,920
You should go back to

796
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,920
where you're from.

797
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,640
Do you know who this is?

798
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,000
How dare you say that?

799
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,120
Who do you think

800
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
you can bring here?

801
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,480
I'm Luo Shiyi,

802
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
a younger sister

803
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,920
of Young Madam Wang.

804
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
Oh! Madam Xu!

805
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,800
Yet I can't

806
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,720
let you in,

807
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,040
simply because

808
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,160
Young Madam is really ill.

809
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,320
The physician said

810
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,120
she needs to rest

811
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,640
and can't be disturbed.

812
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,680
You care for Young Madam.

813
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
I guess

814
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,080
you certainly don't want to

815
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,240
disturb her.

816
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,400
The physician really said so?

817
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,560
Then I really shouldn't disturb her.

818
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,040
However,

819
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,680
I wonder which physician that is.

820
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,360
Please ask him out

821
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,640
so I can really understand

822
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,040
how ill my sister is.

823
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,080
Uh...

824
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,080
He's not here.

825
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,400
What a coincidence!

826
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,120
I've brought a physician with me.

827
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,120
Physician,

828
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,280
please see my sister
and find out what's wrong with her.

829
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
This is Duke Mao's Mansion,

830
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,480
not the Mansion of Xu.

831
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,840
You can't break in.

832
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,840
Throw away any villain

833
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,880
who attempts to stop me

834
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,320
from treating my sister.

835
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,320
-Yes, Your Ladyship!
-Yes, Your Ladyship!

836
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,800
Young Madam.

837
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,120
Erniang.

838
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,520
Erniang.

839
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,480
How come

840
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,920
she's so sick?

841
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,880
Didn't I ask you to leave?

842
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,000
Why are you back?

843
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,200
Why do you bring

844
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,080
these irrelevant people here?

845
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,960
Erniang, we're here to see you.

846
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,160
We're here to see

847
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,800
what we can do for you.

848
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,880
I've broken off all relations with you.

849
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,200
I don't need your help.

850
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,720
What are you laughing at?

851
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,200
You, of course!

852
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,520
Except

853
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,000
acting rudely
and unreasonably before us,

854
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,320
what else can you do?

855
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,920
I do despise you!

856
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,400
Young Madam!

857
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,280
You...

858
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,600
What did you just say?

859
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,280
I thought

860
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,800
you were arrogant,

861
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,880
but at least you've got self-esteem.

862
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,160
Unexpectedly, I was wrong.

863
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,240
You're strong outside

864
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,080
but weak inside.

865
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,680
Seeing that

866
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
the Luo family
tolerate you all the time,

867
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,120
you talk and act unscrupulously.

868
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,080
Yet when dealing with others,

869
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,520
you are so timid that

870
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,480
you abandon dignity and integrity.

871
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
You even asked your maid

872
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,520
to beg us

873
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,000
for help.

874
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,480
Shame on you!

875
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,880
From today on,

876
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,040
don't tell others that
you're my sister.

877
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,680
You're such a disgrace!

878
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,760
Shiyi,

879
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,240
stop saying like that!

880
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,160
You...

881
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,920
Who do you think you are?

882
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,280
You were just lucky enough

883
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
to marry into the Xu family

884
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,400
and have Marquis Yongping

885
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,640
as your husband.

886
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,120
Except that,

887
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
what makes you think
you're better than me?

888
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,160
At least, I won't try to avoid trouble
by burying my head in the sand

889
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,720
like you always do.

890
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Besides pulling

891
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,320
some dirty tricks

892
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,040
to make things worse,

893
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,520
you never face the problems head-on.

894
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,200
Even now,

895
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,840
you just pity yourself

896
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,080
and wait here to die.

897
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,160
Luo Erniang,

898
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,440
you're such a loser!

899
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,640
You deserve to be utterly isolated

900
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,800
and lose everything.

901
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,360
You!

902
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,600
Shut up!

903
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,600
Lady Erniang,

904
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,200
as a maid,

905
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,280
I'm supposed to remain silent,

906
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,800
but I couldn't help

907
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,600
defending Her Ladyship.

908
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,000
Her life

909
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,960
is not so smooth

910
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,320
as you think.

911
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,960
When she first married
into the Xu family,

912
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,440
she also encountered a lot of trouble.

913
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,040
They never stopped

914
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,040
framing her up

915
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,240
and pulling dirty tricks,

916
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,400
but she never complained about it.

917
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,240
Instead, she made it through on her own.

918
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,600
She doesn't owe everything
she's got today

919
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,160
to His Lordship.

920
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,680
Right.

921
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,680
Shiyi is smart!

922
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,240
Shiyi is competent and capable!

923
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,440
I can't hold a candle to her.

924
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Hearing these words,

925
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,280
are you satisfied now?

926
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,400
I'm telling you.

927
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,320
However miserable I am,

928
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,600
I have my own dignity.

929
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,480
I'd rather die

930
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,000
than accept your help.

931
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,720
Young Madam!

932
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,760
Young Madam,

933
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,320
why do you say this?

934
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,600
Now,

935
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,360
they are the only ones
who can help you.

936
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,120
I never asked for their help.

937
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,840
Get out.

938
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,040
All of you! Get out!

939
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,400
Erniang!

940
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,520
Go away!

941
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,720
Fine.

942
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,320
Then you should

943
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,800
take care of your own maid.

944
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,160
Let's go.

945
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,400
