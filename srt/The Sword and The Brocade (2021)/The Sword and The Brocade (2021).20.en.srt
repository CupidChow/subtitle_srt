Lingyi.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,840
Fengqing has been in our family

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,880
for quite a few days.

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,360
Who do you choose

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
to raise this kid?

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
Have you made a decision?

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,840
Shiyi and I have discussed it

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,120
and reached an agreement.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,160
From now on, Fengqing
will be in the custody of...

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,960
Mother.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Mother.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,920
I get along with Fengqing

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,120
very well.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,480
I'd love to take care of him.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
Mother, Lingyi, please trust me.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
I will treat him with all my heart.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,960
Yizhen,

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,040
are you serious?

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,480
Yes, Mother.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
I like Fengqing.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
I'll treat him

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,880
as my own child.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,240
I promise I won't let you down.

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,280
Mother, if you agree,

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
this thing is settled.

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,320
In the future, Fengqing

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,800
will be the son of
my brother Ling'an.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
And Yizhen

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,520
will educate and take care of him.

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,560
Lesson should be learned from the past.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
We'll name him

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,280
Sijie.

51
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm glad

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,920
that you made this decision.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Your words convinced me .

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,840
It's time

55
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,680
to let go of the past.

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,920
Fengqing's happiness

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
matters the most.

58
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,880
See?

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,080
We fought so hard

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
over this child,

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,160
yet in the end,

62
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Her Ladyship did
the Second Madam a favor.

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
And now,

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,320
Her Ladyship makes herself

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,520
look good all the way around.

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,760
Don't you think

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,880
she played both ends

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
against the middle?

69
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,080
Her Ladyship

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,640
has promised you before,

71
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
but she gave the child

72
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,400
to the Second Madam in the end.

73
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,320
How could she do that?

74
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,320
Don't say that.

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
Now, put these away.

76
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,360
We can give them to someone else.

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,560
I don't think I'll get
to use them anymore.

78
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
Bring me the embroidery.

79
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Your Ladyship, your waist injury
is not healed yet.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,560
You need rest.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
I'm fine. I feel much better already.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,160
Your Ladyship,

83
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,120
Master Lingkuan is here

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
to thank you.

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,640
Let him in.

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,480
Lingkuan.

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Shiyi, be careful.

88
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Have a seat, please.

89
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
Lingkuan, don't be like that.

90
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,280
I'm not used to it.

91
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,840
Shiyi, you are being modest.

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,400
I know everything now.

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,840
Thanks to you,

94
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,480
Lingyi and I had a nice chat.

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,280
You also helped to find

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
a nice home for Fengqing,

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,680
and helped Danyang and our child.

98
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,200
There's nothing I can do
to return your favor.

99
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,760
So please accept my gratitude.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Lingkuan,

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,200
never mind. We are family.

102
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:34,920
Sit down.

103
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
After this matter,

104
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,840
I know clearly now
what kind of person you are.

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,480
If anybody dares
gossip about you again,

106
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
I'll be the first to stand up

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
for you.

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,120
No one would gossip about me.

109
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
You think too much, Lingkuan.

110
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,600
But,

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
I am curious about one thing.

112
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,760
Shiyi, what is it?

113
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,480
Lingkuan, you know
that I love embroidery.

114
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,320
I heard

115
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,000
that even though Danyang
stays in the mansion all the time,

116
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,400
she has mastered excellent

117
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,760
embroidery skills.

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,200
I wonder if she ever made
a sachet and such

119
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,760
for you on the Dragon Boat Festival

120
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,640
or the Double Ninth Festival?

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Could you please show it to me,

122
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,440
so that I can learn from her?

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,960
Her skills are far less than excellent.

124
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Danyang only learned embroidery
for a few years

125
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,120
in the Palace when she was little.

126
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
Her skills can't

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
compare to yours.

128
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,880
Shiyi, you flattered her.

129
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,480
This is the one.

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,160
The stitches of this sachet

131
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,120
are layered neatly and quite colorful.

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,760
Danyang is indeed skillful.

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,440
Shiyi, if you like it,

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,400
I can ask Danyang

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,800
to make one for you

136
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,800
in order to thank you

137
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
for your help.

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
Danyang is pregnant.

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
We can't tire her.

140
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,080
Please don't tell her

141
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
about this.

142
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,560
If she got tired because of me,

143
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,400
I'd feel extremely guilty.

144
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,400
You're thoughtful indeed.

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,520
By the way,

146
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,440
Lingkuan, do you still remember

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,200
the homicide case that happened
in Ci'an Temple a year ago?

148
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
I was in the temple

149
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,400
and praying on that day.

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,390
I heard that your mother

151
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,750
was murdered.

152
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,960
That day

153
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,040
I got there late,

154
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,360
and I lost my mother forever.

155
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,880
Though I blame myself in grief,

156
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
I do want to find out

157
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,040
what happened on that day exactly.

158
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,560
But if I start asking questions,

159
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm afraid that others
would misunderstand me.

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,720
When I was there,

161
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,760
I stayed with

162
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,240
Danyang and mother all the time.

163
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,680
I didn't see anything.

164
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,120
But many servants

165
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,760
came along with us on that day.

166
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,640
I can try

167
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,680
to ask them.

168
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,040
Maybe they saw something.

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,280
In that case, I really appreciate it.

170
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,720
It had better

171
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,720
be done in secret.

172
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,120
His Lordship is very busy.

173
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,640
I want to keep this from him,

174
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,920
in case he gets worried.

175
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,920
Shiyi, that's very considerate of you.

176
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,520
I understand.

177
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,400
Then I'll take my leave now.

178
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,960
Take care, Lingkuan.

179
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,240
Your Ladyship,

180
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,320
is there a clue on that sachet?

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,240
It's the same fabric,

182
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
but the stitches

183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,480
and the patterns are quite different.

184
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,680
So it means

185
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,720
that Princess Danyang has nothing

186
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,360
to do with your mother's death.

187
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,720
Lingkuan said

188
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,520
that he stayed with
Danyang all the time.

189
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,240
I don't think
she had anything to do with it.

190
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,460
(Instructions of Ancestors)

191
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,840
It's the auspicious time.

192
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Xu Sijie's Ancestor Worship Ceremony

193
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,760
begins now.

194
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Bring out the genealogy.

195
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,900
(Virtues Above All
Ancestors Memorial Tablets)

196
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,120
Xu Sijie

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,760
is a lost descendant of our clan.

198
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,360
He's returned home
and is accepted by our family.

199
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,880
He'll be adopted by Xu Ling'an.

200
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,680
Respected ancestors,

201
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,240
please bless our Xu family

202
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,160
with great talents,

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,920
peace, and ever-lasting

204
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,600
joy for all generations.

205
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,480
Ceremony is finished.

206
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,000
Yizhen,

207
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,840
Sijie will be your child from now on.

208
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,800
Come, call mother.

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,600
Mother.

I view the green hills by the waterside♪

212

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,320
Your Ladyship.

218
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,880
Young Madam Luo sent a message,

219
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,920
saying that Madam Luo is sick.

220
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,580
(Residence of Luo)

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
Mother,

222
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,840
you were well before.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,680
How come you fell ill all of a sudden?

224
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm old.

225
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,880
My body is starting giving up.

226
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,160
I've heard about it.

227
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,080
You did very well

228
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
in terms of Jie's adoption.

229
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,680
Now that Jie is adopted by Ling'an,

230
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,840
he won't threaten Zhun's status,

231
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
and the concubines

232
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
will also stop fighting over him.

233
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,640
But you can't lower your guard.

234
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,880
You can't let them take

235
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,400
the Marquis's favor away from you.

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,720
His Lordship loves Zhun a lot,

237
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,800
and he also respects me.

238
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,360
Mother, you need not to worry.

239
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,880
Just rest and get better.

240
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
If the Marquis respects you,

241
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,960
why doesn't he

242
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
sleep with you?

243
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,680
You are the one who
manages household affairs now.

244
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,920
And next, you need to figure out a way

245
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,480
to win over the Marquis's heart.

246
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Men all love to try new things.

247
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,480
Let the people around you

248
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,760
try to get close to him.

249
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,120
See which one he likes better.

250
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,160
You and Nanny Tao should

251
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,800
make a plan as soon as possible.

252
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,900
(Rites)

253
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,600
His Lordship visits

254
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
Your Ladyship quite often lately.

255
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,680
How did Madam Luo know

256
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,520
that His Lordship hasn't slept
with Your Ladyship?

257
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
Could it be

258
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,400
that someone secretly

259
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,920
tipped her off?

260
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,840
Amber.

261
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,640
Why don't you dare look at me?

262
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,360
Is it you?

263
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,160
Your Ladyship.

264
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,720
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
Hmph, Amber,

266
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,000
it's really you.

267
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,120
Her Ladyship trusts you a lot,

268
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
but you betrayed her.

269
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,400
You are intended to sleep

270
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,960
with His Lordship
and become a concubine, aren't you?

271
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,280
Your Ladyship, that's not my intention.

272
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,920
Please trust me.

273
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,520
Your Ladyship,

274
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,520
she's not to be trusted.

275
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,320
She betrayed you before.

276
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,080
Stop.

277
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,720
Let's go inside.

278
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,000
Your Ladyship.

279
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,800
Don't worry.

280
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,400
I have an idea.

281
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,160
I made this for you.

282
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,440
Keep it well.

283
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Remember

284
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,000
that this handkerchief

285
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,320
will be a token for us.

286
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,600
Sorry.

287
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,480
In order to find my older sister,

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
I can only listen to Madam Luo.

289
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,280
Sorry.

290
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,840
Your Ladyship, I'm sorry
that I betrayed you.

291
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,160
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

292
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,760
I called you here

293
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,120
not to punish you.

294
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,240
Rise first.

295
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,280
Judging from what mother said,

296
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,800
she doesn't know

297
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,000
that I'm investigating
the death of my birth mother.

298
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,190
You kept it a secret for me,

299
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,240
which means

300
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,520
you are not a greedy traitor.

301
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,710
Do you have any secret?

302
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,040
Is it because she's got the goods on you

303
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,080
so you have to listen to her?

304
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,120
Looks like I guessed right.

305
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Amber, I believe
that you are a good person.

306
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,480
And I won't do harm to you.

307
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't want you

308
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,360
to be manipulated either.

309
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,360
If you trust me,

310
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
I can help you.

311
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,240
Your Ladyship.

312
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
It's not that I don't trust you,

313
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,520
but you can't help me

314
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,040
with this matter.

315
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,760
I'm sorry that I let you down.

316
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,720
I heard that you went back
to the Residence of Luo.

317
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,320
My Lord.

318
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,760
My mother is sick,

319
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,280
so I went back to check on her.

320
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,000
Do I need to let Physician Liu

321
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,720
to take a look at her?

322
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
My Lord, thank you for your concern.

323
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,640
I will let you know

324
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
if he's needed.

325
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
You can also do line drawing?

326
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
Embroidery needs a draft.

327
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,000
Line drawing is a required skill.

328
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
But my drawing skill is poor.

329
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,520
It can't be showed in public.

330
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,200
Please don't laugh at me, My Lord.

331
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,520
Your drawing is tasteful and refined.

332
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,120
There's an

333
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,920
antique feeling

334
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,280
reflected from your drawing.

335
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
It's a very nice piece of work.

336
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,360
My Lord, you are well-versed
in both art and sword indeed.

337
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,800
When drawing it,

338
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
I added water and powder
to still-drying pigment

339
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,760
to make the colors of the rocks meet

340
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,760
so as to reduce the outlines,

341
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,280
hoping that using colors alone

342
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,520
would create the mysterious view

343
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,160
of the lotus pond.

344
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,600
It's a nice drawing for sure.

345
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,080
But how can you

346
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
present it with stitches?

347
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
My Lord, just wait and see.

348
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,920
Did I say anything wrong?

349
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,880
Here you go.

350
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,280
This is...

351
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,840
Open it and take a look.

352
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,720
You lost

353
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,240
your white jade hairpin.

354
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,000
I asked Dongqing

355
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,320
about the style of it.

356
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,000
My Lord, you are so thoughtful.

357
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,680
This hairpin looks almost

358
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,080
the same as the one I lost.

359
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,240
Try it on.

360
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,040
See if it fits you.

361
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,680
Let me.

362
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,960
Thank you, My Lord.

363
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,160
I love it.

364
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,320
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

365
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,040
Zhun. Don't cry.

366
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,160
Don't cry. Don't cry.

367
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,480
Your Ladyship.

368
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
Zhun.

369
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,640
What's wrong?

370
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
What happened, Zhun?

371
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,080
Who made you cry?

372
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Be good.

373
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,520
Zhun, what happened?

374
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,440
Tell me.

375
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,640
What's wrong?

376
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,120
Mother, my wooden sword is broken.

377
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
It's broken?

378
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,000
It's okay. Don't cry.

379
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,200
Zhun.

380
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,880
Don't worry about it.

381
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,240
Your father can fix it for you.

382
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Right, My Lord?

383
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Yes.

384
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,720
It's alright.

385
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,160
Zhun.

386
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,080
Good boy.

387
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,680
Thank you, Father.

388
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,840
In the future,

389
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,240
if your wooden sword is broken,

390
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,960
we can make a new one.

391
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,800
Men shouldn't cry easily.

392
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,560
Crying can't solve the problem.

393
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,040
Go ahead and play.

394
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,400
Zhun.

395
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,600
You have new sword now.

396
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,520
Zhun has been spoiled by the maids

397
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
and nannies since he was born.

398
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,320
There're no men around

399
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
from whom he can learn,

400
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,160
so he appears to be a little weak.

401
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,840
My Lord, actually

402
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,520
you can try to spend more time with him.

403
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,120
With you setting him an example,

404
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,760
Zhun will surely grow into

405
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,560
a strong and responsible man.

406
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,440
Zhun. Zhun.

407
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,640
Here. Come here.

408
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:40,920
Be careful.

409
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,640
Are you okay, Zhun?

410
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,800
-Zhun.
-I'm fine.

411
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,520
I can get up myself.

412
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960
Mother, I'm very well.

413
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
I can keep your company

414
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
every day.

415
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,680
You need to take good care of yourself.

416
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,960
Greetings, Great Madam.

417
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,160
Mother,

418
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,480
I really think Shiyi

419
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,280
is a capable woman.

420
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,600
She's never made any mistake

421
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,400
since she managed household affairs.

422
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,400
She also takes

423
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,880
very good care of Zhun.

424
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,880
No wonder His Lordship goes to

425
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,720
the Western Lateral Court all the time.

426
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,800
Her Ladyship is kind, elegant,

427
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,200
and thoughtful.

428
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,560
How can I

429
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,200
compare with her?

430
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,440
Lianfang, no need to belittle yourself.

431
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,080
After all, not everybody

432
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,080
deserves to be the legal wife.

433
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
Come to think of it,

434
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,520
it's been a long time

435
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,320
since you entered the mansion.

436
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
How come

437
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,760
there's no any sign of pregnancy?

438
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,840
It's my bad.

439
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,840
I'm sorry that I disappointed
Great Madam and His Lordship.

440
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,920
Lianfang,

441
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,560
you are still young.

442
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,440
It's something that'll take time.

443
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,720
Go ahead and take a seat.

444
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,960
Sit down.

445
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,400
Yes, Great Madam.

446
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,960
Zhun. Slow down.

447
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,200
Slow down.

448
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,240
-Zhun is coming.
-Grandma. Grandma. Look.

449
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,160
My father made this wooden sword for me.

450
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,640
Zhun is holding a wooden sword.

451
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,080
Hold it tight.

452
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,400
Mother,

453
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,480
Lingyi even had time

454
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,840
to make a wooden sword for Zhun?

455
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,200
Mother asked him

456
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,480
to make one for me.

457
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
Father listens to her.

458
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,000
You are saying

459
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,880
that your father listens to your mother?

460
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,960
Yes.

461
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,520
Father never gets mad

462
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,400
no matter what mother says.

463
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
Is he talking about Lingyi

464
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,680
in our Xu family?

465
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,040
Zhun, since you have
a new wooden sword now,

466
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,960
let me

467
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,800
teach you a new verse

468
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
to go with your new sword,

469
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,880
okay?

470
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
Okay. Okay. Okay.

471
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,480
I like new verse.

472
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,960
♪The justice spoke itself♪

473
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,120
♪Much was said in praise of him♪

474
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,320
♪Though the Emperor of Song was wise♪

475
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,640
♪He couldn't compare
to Bao Zheng's intelligence♪

476
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,320
This is the play about Bao Zheng

477
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,680
executing Lu Zhailang, right?

478
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,440
Yes. It is.

479
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,640
Zhun.

480
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Do you like your uncle's singing?

481
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
I do.

482
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,320
If you study hard,

483
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,360
I'll let your uncle

484
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,840
teach you more in the future.

485
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,080
Okay.

486
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,520
Lingyi,

487
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,000
I thought

488
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,880
you didn't want Zhun
to listen to the opera.

489
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
What made you change your mind today?

490
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,400
I've thought about it.

491
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,800
I also grew up listening

492
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,040
to those operas,

493
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,600
from which Zhun can learn

494
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,120
how to be a good man.

495
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,840
Shiyi also supports it.

496
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,680
My Lord, I can't believe

497
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,600
that you've changed that much

498
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
since Shiyi married into our family.

499
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
We also tried to convince you

500
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,200
not to be too hard

501
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,200
on Zhun and Lingkuan,

502
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,400
but you never listened to us.

503
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,760
Do you know why?

504
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,000
Because everybody has

505
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
his weakness.

506
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
Alright.

507
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Lingyi must be tired.

508
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,120
Danyang,

509
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,840
you've been sitting for a long time.

510
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,520
You need to go back and lie down.

511
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,040
You can all go back now.

512
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Since Mother is tired,

513
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,680
we'll take off now.

514
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,600
We shall leave now.

515
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,440
Zhaoying.

516
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,440
My Lord.

517
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,720
Have I changed a lot recently?

518
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,040
You look in the mirror a lot lately.

519
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,600
As for changes...

520
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,400
My Lord,

521
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,880
you smile more than before.

522
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,800
I hardly

523
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,480
saw you smile these years.

524
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,040
Dongqing, does it feel tight?

525
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,240
No.

526
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,520
I didn't put on weight.

527
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,600
Look, here is almost...

528
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,360
-It's not...
-Your Ladyship.

529
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,720
His Lordship said
he wouldn't come today.

530
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,920
Then let's eat without him.

531
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,800
Amber, go get a bowl
and a pair of chopsticks.

532
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,880
Yes.

533
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,160
Your Ladyship, don't you think

534
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,880
that His Lordship has been acting weird?

535
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,160
He looks a little uneasy

536
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,440
every time he sees you.

537
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,200
Maybe he's just tired from work.

538
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,840
I don't think so.

539
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,160
He never acted like that

540
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,000
when he was busy before.

541
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,280
Have we offended him?

542
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
I don't think so.

543
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,680
Everything is fine.

544
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,880
Maybe

545
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,720
he doesn't like
the clothes I made for him?

546
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,240
It shouldn't be it.

547
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,680
Maybe

548
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,960
he found out that we didn't actually

549
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,920
go home to visit Madam Luo,

550
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,800
but go to Xianling Pavilion

551
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,040
to teach embroidery instead.

552
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,520
If that,

553
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
he would've talked to me long time ago.

554
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,920
His Lordship is

555
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,360
a straightforward person.

556
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,400
That makes sense.

557
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,000
Now, stop thinking too much.

558
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,800
The minds of the powerful ones

559
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,200
are always complicated.

560
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,200
Your Ladyship, I think

561
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,720
you should go to Banyuepan
and check on him.

562
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,920
I'm not going.

563
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,280
Come on, sit down and let's eat.

564
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,160
Sit down, Amber.

565
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,200
His Lordship is not here anyway.

566
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,800
Come on.

567
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,840
Your Ladyship,
we are just your maids.

568
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,760
I don't think it's...

569
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,600
I've said it.

570
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,640
There are only family

571
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,320
in my room, no maids.

572
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,560
Come on.

573
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,320
-Sit down.
-Come on.

574
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,080
Go ahead and take a seat.

575
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,280
It's tasty.

576
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,280
Amber, would you like some soup?

577
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,640
Let me get you some soup.

578
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,480
(My Lord,)

579
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
(I can't believe)

580
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,840
(that you've changed that much)

581
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
(since Shiyi married into our family.)

582
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,280
(We also tried to convince you)

583
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
(not to be too hard)

584
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,160
(on Zhun and Lingkuan,)

585
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,920
(but you)

586
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,480
(never listened to us.)

587
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,160
My Lord, what are you thinking?

588
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,720
Don't keep it to yourself.

589
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,920
You can talk to me.

590
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,800
Maybe I'll have an idea.

591
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,440
You?

592
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,360
Don't look down on me.

593
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,960
My nickname is Know-all.

594
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,360
You know that, My Lord.

595
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
There's nothing I don't know.

596
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,360
I think

597
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,040
that I'm not

598
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,640
like myself anymore.

599
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,600
Forget it.

600
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,080
You won't understand anyway.

601
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,000
Who

602
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,200
makes you

603
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,800
this uneasy?

604
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,520
It is...

605
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,680
I know.

606
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,320
My Lord, I also found that you've

607
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,840
become a little emotional recently.

608
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,640
Your mind is not peaceful anymore.

609
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,560
But it all

610
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,240
happened after Her Ladyship

611
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,280
married into the family.

612
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,040
So I believe

613
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,200
it's relevant to Her Ladyship.

614
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,440
I'm the master of Xu family.

615
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,920
I'm carrying the future of the whole clan.

616
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,440
I can't be affected by any emotions.

617
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,520
I must be as firm as a stone.

618
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,800
But, My Lord,

619
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,560
you are not a stone.

620
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,840
You are a person,

621
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
a person who has emotions.

622
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,160
There are many things

623
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,640
that are out of your control.

624
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,360
I've never had

625
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,360
this feeling before.

626
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,200
Are you afraid?

627
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,340
(Mansion of Xu)

628
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,360
My Lord.

629
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,840
Is Shiyi in the Western Lateral Court
right now?

630
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,280
Her Ladyship went to
visit her mother today.

631
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,840
Is my mother-in-law

632
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,280
still sick?

633
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,040
It's Zhenxing.

634
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,280
Marquis.

635
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,200
General Fu.

636
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,920
Zhenxing.

637
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,360
Marquis, are you going back
to the mansion?

638
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,880
I'm on my way to the Imperial College.

639
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,040
I didn't expect to meet you here.

640
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,280
I heard that Madam Luo is sick.

641
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,520
Is she getting better?

642
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,120
Does she need Physician Liu
from the Imperial Hospital

643
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
to take a look at her?

644
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,400
Thank you for your concern.

645
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,790
My mother's condition is stable now.

646
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,200
She'll fully recover after

647
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,360
another couple of days.

648
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,790
That's good to hear.

649
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,160
When Shiyi

650
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,480
goes back next time,

651
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,040
I'll let her bring some ginseng

652
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,830
for Madam Luo.

653
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,440
Thank you, Marquis.

654
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,040
I haven't seen Shiyi for a long time.

655
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,560
In that case, we can also

656
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,790
meet each other.

657
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,640
You haven't seen her for a long time?

658
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,120
Hasn't Shiyi

659
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,230
visited home quite often recently?

660
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,120
She hasn't.

661
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,160
Maybe I happened to be outside

662
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,480
when she visited.

663
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,880
So I didn't know.

664
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,140
(Mansion of Xu)

665
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,520
Let's go.

666
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,020
(Mansion of Xu)

667
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,140
(Xianling Pavilion)

668
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,620
(Xianling Pavilion)

669
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,880
Master Luo, you are here.

670
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,240
Master Luo.

671
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
(Xianling Pavilion)
Look at my clothes.

672
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,440
You made it.

673
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,200
What do you think?

674
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,240
It's nice.

675
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,720
Isn't it?

676
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,320
Nice. Very nice.

677
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,400
The embroidery on the cuffs
is so detailed.

678
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:38,960
Right?

679
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,680
It's so nice.

680
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,800
Master Luo, you are here.

681
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,200
Hi.

682
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,800
Look,

683
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,200
I bought this from here.

684
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,560
This is the most popular

685
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,160
fan pattern we have.

686
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,680
It's simple and elegant.

687
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,880
(Delicate Meticulousness)
Look. The fabric is quite nice.

688
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,000
It is good.

689
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,840
And the embroidery is nice, too.

690
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,720
Sir, how may I help you?

691
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,240
We want to look at your
embroidery works.

692
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,480
Any top-line ones you can recommend?

693
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,800
Sure. This way, please.

694
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,880
Please take a look.

695
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,600
This is our latest work.

696
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,280
It is with bright colors
and nicely done.

697
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,200
May I ask

698
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,320
if it's for your wife

699
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,360
or...

700
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
I'm just looking around.

701
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
Sure. Please.

702
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,980
(Hunan Embroidery)

703
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,800
Master Luo, good morning.

704
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,440
Morning.

705
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,840
Today

706
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,280
I'll teach you

707
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,480
the painting-based embroidery.

708
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,880
Chinese ink painting

709
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,040
has always been favored by scholars.

710
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,760
The painting skill directly affects

711
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,440
the drafting and making
of the embroidery works.

712
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,840
Painting-based embroidery...

713
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,920
Showing in public like this.
How inappropriate.

714
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,800
Linbo,

715
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,040
take her away.

716
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,840
...to create a life-like object...

717
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,200
My Lord, there are all women inside.

718
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't think it's proper
for me to go in.

719
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,520
Let me take a look at your work first.

720
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,080
Sir,

721
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,760
are you here to buy embroidery?

722
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,360
Excuse me,

723
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,600
the woman who teaches embroidery...

724
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
She's Master Luo,

725
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,800
Master Jian's student.

726
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,320
Do you want her to
make embroidery for you?

727
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,920
Master Jian...

728
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,880
She is very skillful.

729
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
How often does she come here?

730
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,160
Only three or four times a month.

731
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,680
She's here to give embroidery classes

732
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,000
to the female refugees.

733
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Thanks to Master Luo

734
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,760
and her classes,

735
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
we learned a skill to support

736
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,560
ourselves after the disaster.

737
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,520
Otherwise,

738
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,680
we would've starved to death.

739
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,200
Please go to the front hall
for purchase.

740
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,720
Okay.

741
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,800
My Lord.

742
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,880
Her Ladyship is so kind.

743
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,480
She cares about the refugees so much.

744
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,400
Shall we still go in?

745
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,080
Get a few people
and set up a stand over here.

746
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,160
Keep an eye on the store

747
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,400
and protect Shiyi.

748
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes.

749
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,480
Don't let Shiyi find out.

750
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760
My Lord, why don't you let Her Ladyship

751
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,320
know that you care about her?

752
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,400
Why do you keep your care a secret?

753
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,600
You don't understand.

754
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,960
Of course I do.

755
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,720
My Lord,

756
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,960
you are afraid that
Her Ladyship will feel

757
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,120
uncomfortable if she finds out,

758
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,280
and that she won't feel at easy anymore

759
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,760
when she comes here again.

760
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
You care about her very much.

761
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,160
Are you done yet?

762
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,600
My Lord,

763
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,760
even if you are upset,

764
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,000
I still need to say it.

765
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,880
Some things

766
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,160
are better said than...

767
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,560
Alright. I'll stop talking.

768
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,640
Please don't be mad.

769
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,480
Great Madam,

770
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,160
Mrs. Du said

771
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,600
that you don't have appetite lately.

772
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,480
So, I personally

773
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,680
made some red bean and barley soup,

774
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,160
which can strengthen spleen
and dispel dampness.

775
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,160
I'm sure you'll feel better

776
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,680
after eating it.

777
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,840
Here.

778
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,240
Lianfang, you are so filial.

779
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,400
Actually, I also

780
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,440
made some for Her Ladyship,

781
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,880
but I haven't brought it to her yet.

782
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I heard that she went out again.

783
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,120
I guess she went to see her mother.

784
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,240
She went back again?

785
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,040
It hasn't been long

786
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,120
since she married into our family,

787
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,280
yet she goes back so frequently.

788
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,440
If people knew about it,

789
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,320
they'd think Xu family

790
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,000
mistreats her.

791
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,120
I'm sure Her Ladyship

792
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
is not that thoughtless.

793
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,080
I heard that it's because Madam Luo

794
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,680
fell ill these days.

795
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,800
Her Ladyship prepared

796
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,280
some medicine and silks

797
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,640
to visit her.

798
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,320
She also helps Wuniang

799
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,840
with her dry fruit business.

800
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,840
Even after getting married,
she never forgets where she came from.

801
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,000
It's good not to forget
where she came from.

802
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,440
And our Xu family doesn't care

803
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,080
about those stuff.

804
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,640
But she should

805
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,040
manage well
our household affairs first.

806
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Yet she goes out frequently

807
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,120
and she is nowhere to be found.

808
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,480
It's so inappropriate.

809
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,720
Great Madam, you are right.

810
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,080
Greetings, Mother.

811
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,200
Lingyi, you are back.

812
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,800
My Lord.

813
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,400
Have a seat.

814
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,160
What's up?

815
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,760
What were you talking about?

816
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,240
Shiyi

817
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,120
went back to Luo family again

818
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,360
to take care of Madam Luo.

819
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,400
Mother,

820
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,640
filial piety is one of the virtues
to be held above all else.

821
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,240
If Shiyi

822
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,520
doesn't even look

823
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,680
after her own mother,

824
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,080
how do you expect her

825
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,440
to look after you

826
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,160
when you fall ill?

827
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
You do know how

828
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,840
to protect your wife.

829
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,840
