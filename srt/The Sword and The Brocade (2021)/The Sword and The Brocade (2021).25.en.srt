As the saying goes,

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,080
complaisance without a reason
harbors ill intentions.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Wang Yu must have something

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,600
that the Ou family can
take advantage of.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,480
That's why Ou Lixing tried so hard

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,440
to get close to him.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,360
Wang Yu is addicted to
the pleasure of women.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,120
Maybe we could start our investigation

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,280
from this aspect.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,840
Your thought is reasonable, My Lord.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
Speaking of this,

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,560
I must say that Lingkuan
has become maturer.

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
Whatever comes his way now,

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
he bears in mind the interests of
our Xu family.

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
If what Lingkuan said is true,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
you must thank him properly, My Lord.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
How do you think I should thank him?

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,320
Needless to say, you should

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,760
reward him with whatever he likes.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,440
He likes opera.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
Could I reward him with an opera script?

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
Why can't you?

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
Moreover,

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,680
what is wrong with the opera?

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,280
Everyone has their own hobbies.

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,280
You should think it is lucky that

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,120
his hobby is not drinking,
gambling or visiting brothels.

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,200
My Lord, if you

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,840
force him to give up his only hobby,

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
you may have to worry that

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,880
he will get taken with other things.

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,320
Not everybody is
as self-disciplined as you.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
Did you praise me

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,840
just now?

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,300

why he wants to see me?

74
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,240
I have no idea.

75
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,560
You'd better ask His Lordship yourself.

76
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,540
(The Oil Seller and the Song Girl
Volume I)

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,440
Is Lingyi testing me?

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,880
Lingyi.

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,440
You need not put it down.

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,160
This book The Oil Seller
and the Song Girl has just come out.

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
I am giving it to you.

82
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,200
Do you really mean to give it to me?

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
Don't you want it?

84
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
Yes, I do. I do.

85
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,840
I want it.

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Linbo has made investigations.

87
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,080
It is true that these days

88
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,880
Ou Lixing is hanging out with Wang Yu.

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
This is a reward for you.

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Lingyi.

91
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,320
This book

92
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,840
consists of two volumes.

93
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
This is

94
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
Volume I.

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,440
I think I'd better

96
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
give the two volumes to you at a time.

97
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
No, don't do that.

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,400
Shiyi.

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,280
My Lord.

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
-Are you all right?
-Lingkuan.

101
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
Be careful not to hurt your hand.

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,320
This arrow

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,920
looks different

104
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
from the other arrows I saw.

105
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,640
This is a three-edged arrow.

106
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,440
It comes with a barb and a fuller.

107
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,200
It's slightly larger

108
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,480
than average arrows.

109
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
Only the Xu family
has this kind of arrow.

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,760
Why are you here?

111
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,760
Mother wants us

112
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,560
to have lunch together
in the Fushou Court.

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,680
So she ordered me to inform you of it.

114
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
OK. Let's head for there right now.

115
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
We shouldn't keep Mother waiting.

116
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,000
OK.

117
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,080
Lingkuan.

118
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,360
Let's go together.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,640
OK, Lingyi.

120
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,760
Let's go.

121
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,000
You must remember

122
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,400
don't be too obsessed with it.

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Your Ladyship.

124
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,600
Master Lingkuan seems to

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,040
be carrying an opera script.

126
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,400
He isn't afraid that His Lordship
will be angry about it?

127
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,840
His Lordship is always grim-faced,
but warm-hearted.

128
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,840
He took a lot of trouble

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,360
and paid a high price

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
to buy that book.

131
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
Well, I think

132
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,680
we all misjudged His Lordship

133
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
in the past.

134
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,000
His Lordship acts like

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,440
a cold fish outside.

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,160
Actually he is all for
the good of this family.

137
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,920
In fact, His Lordship

138
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,840
is loving and warm in heart.

139
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,760
Dongqing,

140
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
you know so much

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
about His Lordship's merits.

142
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,440
Are you his maid

143
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,580
or my maid?

144
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,020
(He's Clinic)

145
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,580
(He's Clinic)

146
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,720
Your Ladyship.

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,560
Mrs. Du.

148
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
These two nannies

149
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,640
are senior servants

150
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,240
familiar with childbirth in our mansion.

151
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
Considering that you got pregnant
for the first time,

152
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
the Great Madam especially sent them

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,640
to attend to you.

154
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,680
By the way,

155
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,240
the Great Madam also sent her words that

156
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,800
you should keep in mind that

157
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
you have a bun in the oven

158
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
so that you should
go out as less as you can

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,520
these days.

160
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,600
I got it.

161
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,240
Mrs. Du.

162
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Please tell Mother

163
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,320
I thank her.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
Then I'll leave you
to have a good rest.

165
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,760
Take good care of Her Ladyship.

166
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Yes.

167
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,800
Please allow me to excuse myself.

168
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,960
My Lord,

169
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,720
the matter has been checked out.

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,880
Egged on by Ou Lixing,

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,360
Wang Yu is pestering an entertainer of
the Tianxiang House.

172
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,080
The entertainer's name is Liansong.

173
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,120
She is the adopted daughter

174
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,760
of Duke Wei, Ren Kun.

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
Duke Wei.

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,760
Due to the death of Official Hu,

177
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
he is slightly changing his position

178
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,520
on the sea ban

179
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
in recent days.

180
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,440
I guess Ou Lixing wants to use Wang Yu

181
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,910
to drive a wedge between Duke Wei and me

182
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,120
whereby Duke Wei's position

183
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,280
on the sea ban will be changed.

184
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,120
I had my men watching Wang Yu.

185
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,400
Today I got the news that

186
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,030
Duke Wei took Liansong

187
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,080
to go out for a diversion.

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,760
After Wang Yu got to know it
this morning,

189
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,040
he went after them.

190
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,960
Get the horse ready.

191
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,680
We can't let the Ou family succeed
in their scheme.

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,760
Yes, My Lord.

193
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Your Ladyship,

194
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,880
the He's Clinic has sent someone

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,320
to bring you the medication.

196
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,040
I have had the physician examine it.

197
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760
It is the anti-miscarriage drug indeed.

198
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,000
It is non-toxic in nature.

199
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
And nothing is wrong with the dosage.

200
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,640
Nothing is wrong?

201
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
It's impossible.

202
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,320
What has gone wrong exactly?

203
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,560
Your Ladyship.

204
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,320
If we can't find the evidence

205
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,000
to prove Concubine Qiao
poisoned late Her Ladyship,

206
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,760
you'd better bring your
fake pregnancy to a close

207
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
as soon as possible.

208
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,760
Otherwise...

209
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,400
Otherwise, if the Great Madam

210
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,640
finds out you've deceived her,

211
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,360
the consequences
will be unimaginably serious.

212
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
I know that.

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,080
Has Wan Daxian

214
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,680
sent any message?

215
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
You go see Wan Daxian immediately

216
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
to ask him to find out
Mingjing's recent moves.

217
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,960
Yes, Your Ladyship.

218
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,440
What happened?

219
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,280
Why are you in such a hurry?

220
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,320
Something has been going wrong
in Xianling Pavilion recently.

221
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
What is the matter?

222
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,360
When I went there today,

223
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
Master Jian told me

224
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,520
that a new embroidery girl coming from
the disaster-hit area

225
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,920
seems to be kind of dissatisfied

226
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,920
with the pay.

227
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,680
She incited other embroiderers
whenever she got a chance.

228
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,040
What's more, Master Jian found that

229
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,600
she seems to be in association
with the Qiao family.

230
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,920
The Qiao family?

231
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,800
If my guess is right,

232
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,120
Concubine Qiao has found out that

233
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,360
I am suspecting her.

234
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,600
Could it be possible that

235
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,280
she has also become aware of

236
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
the fact that

237
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,520
you are pretending to be pregnant.

238
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,080
What do we do now?

239
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,200
I'll go to the Xianling Pavilion first.

240
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Master Jian has nothing to do
with this matter.

241
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,080
I can't let her
get involved in this trouble.

242
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,840
Your Ladyship.

243
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,200
With the nannies watching you,

244
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,800
how can you go out?

245
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,040
Where is the Great Madam now?

246
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,280
The scent of flowers
assails the nostrils.

247
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,800
Indeed.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,640
Exactly. Those flowers' scent
is very strong.

249
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,120
Greetings to you, Mother.

250
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,200
Greetings to you, Your Ladyship.

251
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,520
Shiyi.

252
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,040
You came at the right time.

253
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
These flowers

254
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,720
were sent here by Concubine Qin.

255
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,960
They look so pretty

256
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
placed in the celadon vase.

257
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,040
They smell very fragrant.

258
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,160
Smell them.

259
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,560
They smell very aromatic.

260
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,120
Shiliu really has

261
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,040
a green thumb.

262
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,880
Seeing the Great Madam
and Your Ladyship like them,

263
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,600
I am so happy.

264
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,760
Well,

265
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,520
I'll go to the market in a while

266
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,880
to buy some seeds of flower plants.

267
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,960
When the Spring Festival comes,
they will bloom.

268
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,360
I will give them out to all
to add to the festive atmosphere.

269
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,760
You are so thoughtful.

270
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,920
Mother.

271
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
I feel I am stifling in my room

272
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,000
these days.

273
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,520
I also want to go out to
get some fresh air.

274
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,240
Could I

275
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,040
accompany Concubine Qin

276
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,600
to buy the seeds of flower plants?

277
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,480
It will do good to

278
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
the baby I am carrying.

279
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,400
If so,

280
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,280
take Nanny Zhang and Nanny Wang

281
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,600
with you.

282
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,640
That's not necessary.

283
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,680
If I take them with me,
it will be too eye-catching.

284
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
Concubine Qin is with me.

285
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,520
You need not worry.

286
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Right, Great Madam.

287
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,920
You need not worry.

288
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
I will take good care of Her Ladyship.

289
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,520
Don't tarry too long outside.

290
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,760
Yes, Great Madam.

291
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,840
Thank you, mother.

292
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,400
You can go now.

293
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
Great Madam.

294
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,280
Today the weather is fine.

295
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,400
How about we go out for a walk?

296
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,440
Good idea.

297
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,720
I remember that

298
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Great Madam

299
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,520
likes the dishes of
the Chunxi Restaurant the best.

300
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,520
Recently,

301
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
it has added new dishes to its menu.

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Would Great Madam
like to have a taste of them

303
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,040
with me accompanying you?

304
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,240
OK. I'd like to.

305
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,160
Let's go out to get some fresh air.

306
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,040
Take care.

307
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,520
Well, I am fine. Don't mind me.

308
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,480
Where did you get so much money?

309
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,880
I worried that you might be deceived.

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
So I took your embroideries

311
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
and sold them in secret.

312
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,040
I sold ten articles of embroideries
in total.

313
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
And I got
twenty tael of silver for them.

314
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,160
Twenty tael of silver?

315
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
This suggests
that each of our embroideries

316
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,720
can sell for two tael of silver.

317
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,840
But Xianling Pavilion told us

318
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
each of them is only worth
200 copper coins.

319
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,560
I didn't expect that Xianling Pavilion

320
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,640
has been duping all of you all along.

321
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,200
How could they do this?

322
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes. How could they?

323
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,960
Even though we are powerless people

324
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,520
from the disaster-affected areas,

325
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
they can't bully us like this.

326
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,760
This is too much.

327
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
I have got an idea.

328
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,040
As long as you do as I say...

329
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,060
(Xianling Pavilion)

330
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Stop.

331
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,540
(Xianling Pavilion)

332
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,840
What is the matter, Your Ladyship?

333
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,160
Did the bumpy ride

334
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,000
make you uncomfortable?

335
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,960
No, it didn't.

336
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
I want to go buy an embroidery.

337
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,640
Please wait for me here.

338
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,600
I will be back in a while.

339
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I won't delay you long.

340
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,720
Your Ladyship.

341
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,280
Is that Feicui

342
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,680
who serves Concubine Qin?

343
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,920
Why did their carriage

344
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,440
come to a halt?

345
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,840
Could it be possible that

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,040
Shiyi got into any trouble?

347
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
Hurry to send someone to check it out.

348
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
Let me see a little longer.

349
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,520
Look.

350
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,320
That girl in red

351
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,640
is the girl Dongqing mentioned.

352
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
Yes. That's really unfair.

353
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,080
Let's go have a look.

354
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,320
How can they bully us like this?

355
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,280
It's outrageous.

356
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
How could they do things this way?

357
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,480
Exactly. They couldn't do this to us.

358
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,280
I second it. It is unacceptable.

359
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,520
Why aren't you practicing?

360
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,040
Why are you standing here?

361
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
Master Jian, Master Luo,

362
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,160
from now on,

363
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,320
we will quit our jobs
in Xianling Pavilion.

364
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,760
-Yes.
-Yes. We will quit.

365
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,280
We will quit.

366
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,280
Why?

367
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,520
Because Xianling Pavilion

368
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,800
has been swindling us.

369
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,960
Each of the embroideries we finish

370
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,440
can obviously sell for
two tael of silver.

371
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,760
But you told us that

372
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,240
each of them is
only worth 200 copper coins.

373
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,080
You have been swindling us

374
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,320
on purpose.

375
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,920
-Exactly.
-You have been deducting our pay.

376
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,200
-Yes.
-You treat us too badly.

377
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,880
It is clear that
you have been bullying us.

378
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,760
She is right.

379
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,640
Xianling Pavilion

380
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,240
should return our deducted pay

381
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,000
to us.

382
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,360
-Yes.
-Give our pay back to us.

383
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,840
Give our pay back to us.

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,360
Enough. Enough.

385
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,560
-Enough.
-Return our pay to us.

386
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,960
Silence please.

387
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,880
Xianling Pavilion has been running

388
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,080
for a long time.

389
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,800
We haven't done any dishonest deeds.

390
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,640
About this matter,

391
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
you must have misunderstood.

392
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,960
-Impossible.
-We didn't misunderstand.

393
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,880
There is no misunderstanding at all.

394
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,640
The fact is that
you have been bullying us.

395
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,800
Young Lady,

396
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,360
what is your name?

397
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Which disaster-hit county are you from?

398
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,400
How many people are there
in your family?

399
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
What?

400
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Where did she come from?

401
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,720
I came from a village

402
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,560
north of the capital.

403
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,640
I heard that the area
north of the capital

404
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,080
was hit by the disaster
the most severely.

405
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,200
How is your family?

406
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,520
Yes.

407
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,160
This flood

408
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,480
washed away many houses in our village

409
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,240
and drowned a few villagers.

410
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,120
Nonsense.

411
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,840
In this disaster, the area
north of the capital

412
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,440
was the least affected.

413
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,240
Also, there were no casualties.

414
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,640
You are lying.

415
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,600
Who is she exactly?

416
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
Has she deceived us?

417
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,280
-You liar.
-She lied.

418
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,440
She lied.

419
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,680
Who are you on earth?

420
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,960
Everybody.

421
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,680
It doesn't matter where I come from.

422
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,120
What matters is that

423
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,400
the truth has come out.

424
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,200
We can't endure the injustice anymore.

425
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,720
Xianling Pavilion

426
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,600
must return every penny

427
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,600
we should have been paid

428
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,480
to us.

429
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,080
Right. Return our pay to us.

430
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,800
Return our pay to us.

431
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,600
Look at her hand, everybody.

432
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Her hand is so delicate.

433
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,240
It's not the hand of
a farmer's daughter.

434
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,120
She doesn't come from a village

435
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,480
or is a refugee.

436
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,120
Don't fall for her lie.

437
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,120
Impossible.

438
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,400
She just doesn't want to pay us in full.

439
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,720
She just doesn't want to
return our deducted wages to us.

440
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,800
Hurry to return our pay to us.

441
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,360
Return it to us.

442
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,720
You all heard her, right?

443
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,400
She not only refused to
return our pay to us,

444
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,960
but also slandered me.

445
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,840
Everybody,

446
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,080
today we must make them

447
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,040
return our deducted pay to us.

448
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,400
-Yes.
-Return our pay to us.

449
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,110
Return our pay to us.

450
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,830
Return our pay to us.

451
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,480
Great Madam.

452
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,520
Her Ladyship seems to be over there.

453
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,640
-Yes.
-Today we must make them

454
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,350
return our deducted pay to us.

455
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,160
This is so unfair.

456
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,070
Return our deducted pay to us.

457
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,720
You can't do such a thing.

458
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,280
Listen up, everybody.

459
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,160
Since all of you don't believe us,

460
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,070
we'd better report this matter
to the government.

461
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,350
Then the government
will handle this case fairly.

462
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,040
OK. Let's go see the official.

463
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,200
-Well...
-We are not afraid to see the official.

464
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,680
-Right.
-We are not afraid to see the official.

465
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,350
If the government official

466
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,760
also rules that we are at fault,

467
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,310
we will give you double pay
as compensation.

468
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,040
How do you think of this?

469
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,720
Fine.

470
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,680
Let's go to see the official.

471
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,680
-Yes. Let's go to see the official.
-Yes.

472
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,080
You can't report this case
to the government.

473
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
She is the wife of Marquis Yongping.

474
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,760
None of the officials

475
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,120
would dare to try a case of her.

476
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,200
Wife?

477
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,040
Master Luo is
the wife of Marquis Yongping?

478
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes.

479
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,760
Resorting to the Xu family's power,

480
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,200
she built this embroidery workshop.

481
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Superficially,

482
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,840
she took in the female refugees

483
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,640
to do good deeds and build up goodwill.

484
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,880
But actually,

485
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,920
she has been exploiting us extremely.

486
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,200
She has been
taking advantage of our labor

487
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,320
to seek profits for herself.

488
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,680
She doesn't treat us as humans at all.

489
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,960
How could you lie in your teeth?

490
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,560
I didn't lie at all.

491
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,840
You should know clearly

492
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,920
how nicely Her Ladyship
has been treating you.

493
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,720
How could you do such a thing?

494
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,360
What is Shiyi

495
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,080
doing here exactly?

496
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,760
Great Madam, don't be angry.

497
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,560
Her Ladyship

498
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,400
is carrying His Lordship's child now.

499
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
When did we ever

500
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,440
exploit and bully you?

501
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,400
When didn't we

502
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,320
see you as humans?

503
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,520
How could you treat Her Ladyship
so disrespectfully?

504
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,960
You were way out of line doing this.

505
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,240
Servants, take them to the government.

506
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,960
-Go. Go.
-Go.

507
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,880
Who gave you the right to catch us?

508
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,480
-Shake a leg.
-Go.

509
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,240
Let go of me.

510
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,480
Your Ladyship.

511
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,640
Your Ladyship, are you all right?

512
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,320
Shiyi.

513
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,480
-Shiyi.
-Let go of me.

514
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
Are you fine?

515
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,160
Shiyi.

516
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
The physician said that
you are not pregnant

517
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,600
and you are having a period.

518
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,400
What is going on?

519
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,680
Mother.

520
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Lianfang.

521
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,640
You once managed household affairs.

522
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,960
You should know all things
in this family very well.

523
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,960
Tell me

524
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
when should Shiyi's menstruation

525
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,960
start.

526
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Report to you, Great Madam.

527
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,360
Her Ladyship's menstruation

528
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,160
was supposed to start three days ago.

529
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
Your Ladyship,
Mingjing has gone missing.

530
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,000
Shiyi.

531
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,960
Since you came to know
that you are not pregnant

532
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,000
three days ago,

533
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,160
why didn't you clarify it

534
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,480
and why have you kept it a secret?

535
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,480
Could it be possible
that from the very start,

536
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
you have been
pretending you are pregnant.

537
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,600
Mother,

538
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,320
about this matter,

539
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,880
there must be some misunderstanding.

540
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,600
Shiyi.

541
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,280
What happened exactly?

542
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
The truth about this matter
can be withheld for some time,

543
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,720
but can't be concealed all the time.

544
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,460
So it is impossible for Her Ladyship

545
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,040
to lie to you, Great Madam.

546
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,200
I guess

547
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,840
Her Ladyship must
have her unspeakable reasons.

548
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,080
Shiyi,

549
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,040
whether you have deceived me
intentionally

550
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,920
or we have misunderstood you,

551
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,520
today, in front of everybody,

552
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,640
I will give you a chance
to explain yourself.

553
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
Fine.

554
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,920
Then let me ask you another question.

555
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,480
Since when did you start your business

556
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,520
in Xianling Pavilion

557
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,440
without letting me know?

558
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Mother.

559
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,680
I am only teaching

560
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,680
the refugees embroidery
and not doing business

561
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,680
in Xianling Pavilion.

562
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,960
Great Madam.

563
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,800
Her Ladyship is doing
that out of kindness.

564
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I guess she has been hiding it from you

565
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,400
in order not to make you angry.

566
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,960
Since she didn't want to make me angry,

567
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,240
why has she done it?

568
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
Since she has been doing a good deed,

569
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,280
why did those refugees

570
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,360
allege with certainty that

571
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
you have been exploiting them?

572
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,120
This has implicated our Xu family

573
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,920
and brought disgrace upon us.

574
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,960
Mother,

575
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,920
someone must have tried to
sabotage our doing

576
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,200
and tried to frame me on purpose.

577
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,400
Mother, please grant me some time.

578
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,040
I will certainly find out the truth

579
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,680
to redeem the good reputation
of our Xu family.

580
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,040
OK.

581
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,440
How will you prove your innocence?

582
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,600
Report to the official?

583
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,360
You want to make a fuss
about this matter

584
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,880
and let our Xu family
become the laughingstock

585
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,320
of all people?

586
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,880
It doesn't matter
whether you are innocent or not.

587
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,160
You have

588
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,200
done a thing a woman shouldn't do.

589
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,520
That's why you caused us
such great trouble.

590
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,160
You still don't see the error
of your ways?

591
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,040
Great Madam.

592
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,400
Don't be too angry.

593
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,160
Her Ladyship said just now that

594
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,360
someone must have plotted against her

595
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,520
in the case of Xianling Pavilion.

596
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,560
Maybe Her Ladyship

597
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,920
has found out something about it.

598
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,240
What is done can't be undone.

599
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,880
It won't help even if you blame her now.

600
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,160
We'd better

601
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
give Her Ladyship the chance to tell us

602
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,200
the whole story about this matter.

603
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,120
Maybe

604
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,480
it has something to do
with her fake pregnancy.

605
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,400
Dongqing.

606
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,280
Why are you looking at me like this?

607
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Madam,

608
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,080
why are you still playing nice?

609
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,680
All things happened because of you.

610
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,080
You caused late Her Ladyship's death.

611
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,480
Now you are trying to
victimize Her Ladyship.

612
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,800
You are so black-hearted.

613
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Dongqing, what did you say?

614
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,880
Dongqing.

615
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,840
As a maid,

616
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,560
it is a serious offense for you

617
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,360
to make unfounded attacks
upon a lady of higher status.

618
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,160
You can punish me, Great Madam.

619
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,880
But all I said is true.

620
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,080
Concubine Qiao has colluded with
the He's Clinic

621
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
and tampered with the drug to cause
late Her Ladyship's miscarriage.

622
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,400
As a result,
late Her Ladyship's body weakened

623
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,040
and passed away.

624
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,360
The reason for Her Ladyship
to have pretended to be pregnant

625
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,000
is to force Concubine Qiao
to take action

626
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,960
to get the evidence
corroborating her crime.

627
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,920
Shiyi.

628
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,160
What does Dongqing mean by saying that?

629
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,160
Dongqing.

630
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,160
You can't say such groundless words.

631
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
Great Madam,
please judge this matter wisely.

632
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,400
The trouble of Xianling Pavilion

633
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,040
is also Concubine Qiao's conspiracy.

634
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,840
She has caused the death of
late Her Ladyship.

635
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,640
Now she is plotting against
Her Ladyship.

636
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,320
Her doing is so despicable.

637
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,640
Your Ladyship,

638
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,880
I know you have done something wrong

639
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,160
and are afraid to be punished
by Great Madam and His Lordship.

640
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,800
But this can't

641
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,320
be the reason for you to

642
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,400
shift the responsibility to me.

643
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,760
Though I am a concubine,

644
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,920
I am the legitimate daughter
of the Qiao family.

645
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,840
I have learned from the books of sages.

646
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,400
So I have a sense of honesty and honor

647
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,120
as well as know the difference
between wrong and right.

648
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
I swear

649
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,280
I haven't done such malicious things.

650
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,760
Great Madam.

651
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,760
I have a clear conscience,

652
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,240
so I don't fear
to be interrogated in court.

653
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Great Madam,

654
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,520
please right the wrong I suffered

655
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,400
and uphold justice for me.

656
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,160
Shiyi,

657
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,880
did they say that

658
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,600
at your behest?

659
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,840
Mother.

660
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,040
Everything Dongqing and Amber said

661
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,080
is true.

662
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,480
OK.

663
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,600
This is a serious matter.

664
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,040
If what they said is

665
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,360
true,

666
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,360
do you have evidence to prove it?

667
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,160
I have been investigating this matter.

668
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,040
However,

669
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,920
something went wrong in the process

670
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,960
and the evidence was lost.

671
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,040
If you can't provide evidence,
you are vilifying them.

672
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,600
Physician He has been a friend
of our Xu family for many years.

673
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,440
He has always been a kind
and philanthropic person

674
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,600
who is discreet in word and deed.

675
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,480
I have faith in his personality.

676
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
I also have watched Lianfang

677
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,120
since her childhood.

678
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,360
How could you vilify them brazenly

679
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
and fabricate stories about them?

680
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,080
Shiyi.

681
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
You did the wrong things.

682
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
But you didn't admit your fault.

683
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,520
Moreover, you incited your maids
to defame others maliciously

684
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,200
to excuse yourself.

685
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,400
With such inferior morality and conduct,

686
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,640
do you deserve to be
the matron of our Xu family?

687
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,960
Your Ladyship.

688
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,320
What did I do wrong exactly

689
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,080
to make you wrong me so flagrantly?

690
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,280
Her Ladyship didn't wrong you.

691
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
You did cause late Her Ladyship's death.

692
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,720
Now you are trying to do harm to

693
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,440
Zhun and Her Ladyship.

694
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
You will get your comeuppance.

695
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,680
I know you don't like me all the time.

696
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,960
But how could you allow

697
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,800
your maid

698
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,680
to talk to me so rudely?

699
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,760
You blamed the death of
late Her Ladyship on me

700
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,560
and claimed that

701
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
I am trying to victimize you and Zhun.

702
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
You are forcing me to die.

703
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Fine.

704
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
Then today I will...

705
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,760
Today I will die in front of you.

706
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
-Your Ladyship.
-Stop.

707
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,520
-Madam.
-Don't do that.

708
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,280
-Madam.
-Stop.

709
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,800
Madam.

710
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,080
You did nothing wrong.

711
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,360
Why need you die?

712
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,680
Your Ladyship,

713
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,960
you wronged her so much.

714
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,280
Are you intending to kill her?

715
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,160
You are so good at acting.

716
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,720
Why don't you take up performance?

717
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,040
Shiyi.

718
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,480
I will give you another chance.

719
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,280
If you admit your fault,

720
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,720
I will still see you as

721
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,880
the daughter-in-law of our Xu family.

722
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,200
Shiyi.

723
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,920
Hurry to apologize to Mother.

724
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,920
Mother.

725
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,440
I am wrong to have deceived you.

726
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,360
But I am not wrong to

727
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,520
have taught the refugees embroidery

728
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,440
in Xianling Pavilion.

729
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,800
I am not wrong

730
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
to have accused Qiao Lianfang
of the evil deeds.

731
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Fine.

732
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,360
Mother, remit your anger, please.

733
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,640
-All right.
-Mother.

734
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,720
Shiyi.

735
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,400
You pretended to be pregnant
and deceived everyone.

736
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,080
You made public appearances
in the embroidery workshop

737
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,120
without letting me know all along.

738
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
You capitalized on the refugees.

739
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,000
Today, in front of so many people,

740
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,920
you talked back to me and offended me.

741
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,800
All things you did

742
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,400
are breaches of filial obedience.

743
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,440
You vilified Lianfang.

744
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,880
It is an act of jealousy.

745
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,000
You incited your maids
to talk nonsense

746
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,520
to foment discord and defame others.

747
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,640
This is an offense in word.

748
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,840
Shiyi.

749
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,480
As the matron of Xu family,

750
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,400
you departed from the right way

751
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,760
and uttered insulting remarks.

752
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,120
You have committed

753
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,440
crimes that would have you
kick out of this family.

754
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,000
Do you know?

755
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
Mother, calm your anger, please.

756
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Servants.

757
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Where is Lingyi?

758
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,520
Call him in.

759
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,760
Great Madam.

760
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,600
His Lordship just had someone
send the message that

761
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,080
he went out of the capital
for some business

762
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,320
and wouldn't come back today.

763
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,880
OK.

764
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,200
I will decide this case today.

765
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,400
Lianfang,

766
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,720
go prepare the carriage

767
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,320
to send Shiyi back to the Luo Family.

768
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,120
The Luo Family should be informed of

769
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,480
the crimes she has committed.

770
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,160
When Lingyi is back,

771
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,120
she will be repudiated.

772
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
Yes, Great Madam.

773
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,660
(Mansion of Xu)

774
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,820
(Mansion of Xu)

775
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:17,780
(Mansion of Xu)

776
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,000
Luo Shiyi,

777
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,760
you have committed the crimes

778
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,800
and got kicked out of the Xu family.

779
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,920
In no time,

780
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,200
the Divorce Agreement
from His Lordship.

781
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,800
will be sent to your Luo Family.

782
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,320
From now on,

783
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,520
I hope you can free your mind of evil

784
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,640
and conduct yourself well.

785
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,720
Congratulations to you, Madam.

786
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Luo Shiyi fancied herself clever

787
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,720
and tried to plot against you.

788
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,880
But she didn't expect that

789
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,520
you are more resourceful

790
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,200
and would get her caught
in her own trap.

791
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,160
Consequently,
she had to leave the Xu family

792
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,640
with her tail between her legs.

793
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,840
It's not a time to celebrate.

794
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,680
His Lordship still doesn't know this.

795
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,200
It's a pity that His Lordship
is not at home today.

796
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,240
Otherwise,

797
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,680
His Lordship would have heard
with his own ears

798
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,160
the crimes Luo Shiyi committed

799
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,360
and seen with his own eyes
her ferocious and sinister look.

800
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,240
Then, His Lordship would

801
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
have repudiated her immediately.

802
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,480
When His Lordship comes back,

803
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,960
we must act cautiously and prudently

804
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,320
and we can't afford to
make a single slip

805
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,080
to waste all our previous efforts.

806
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,520
Amber.

807
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,920
What happened to Mingjing?

808
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,080
He has gone missing.

809
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,800
Wan Daxian couldn't find him.

810
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,720
Nothing is wrong with the medication.

811
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
And something bad happened to

812
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,560
Mingjing and Xianling Pavilion

813
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,280
Just now,

814
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,720
in front of the Great Madam

815
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,960
Qiao Lianfang pushed me hard

816
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,960
trying to force me to admit that

817
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,600
I have cheated the Great Madam.

818
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
What's more,

819
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,280
she has resorted to all means

820
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,600
to make me a bad person
who bullied the refugees,

821
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,120
ruined the good reputation
of the Xu family

822
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,560
and vilified her.

823
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,040
These are all
her conspiracies against me.

824
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,440
Your Ladyship.

825
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,480
I shouldn't have done things
impulsively.

826
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,280
But when I saw Qiao Lianfang

827
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,040
do that to you,

828
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,600
I just couldn't help saying those words.

829
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,840
As a result, I fell into her trap

830
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,280
and made the Great Madam angry.

831
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,640
It's not your fault.

832
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,680
I didn't let Amber stop you.

833
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,680
Well, Your Ladyship,

834
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,320
what do you mean?

835
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,400
Your Ladyship have seen through

836
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,600
what Qiao Lianfang was planning on,

837
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,040
but you gave away your thoughts
voluntarily.

838
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Do you have other plans, Your Ladyship?

839
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,120
Only by making her think that

840
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,720
we have fallen into her trap,

841
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,360
will she leave us alone.

842
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,920
Only when she thinks
that her conspiracy worked,

843
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,240
will she let her guard down.

844
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,400
In this way,

845
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,520
we can have the chance to

846
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,280
investigate this matter thoroughly.

847
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,600
Besides, I did
improper things successively

848
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,800
and took the bad attitude

849
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,120
in order to inflame the Great Madam

850
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,320
so that she would drive us out.

851
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,320
If we are confined to the Mansion of Xu,

852
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,040
we will not be able to take any actions.

853
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,640
Nevertheless,

854
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,320
how should we

855
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,160
find the missing Mingjing?

856
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,100
Giddy up.

857
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,360
Don't kill him.

858
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,720
Greetings to you, Duke Wei.

859
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,000
Xu Lingyi.

860
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,960
Why did you come here?

861
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,600
Are you going to
defend your brother-in-law?

862
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,640
Ma...Marquis Yongping.

863
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,760
Save me, please.

864
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
He is trying to kill me.

865
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,720
Please calm your anger, Duke Wei.

866
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,600
Yes. Yes, please.

867
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,360
Please. Please.

868
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,480
You mustn't act recklessly.

869
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,320
Shut up.

870
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,320
This bastard tried to
kidnap my adopted daughter

871
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
in broad daylight

872
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,960
while I was off guard.

873
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,240
He dared to kidnap a girl flagrantly.

874
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,480
Shouldn't he be killed?

875
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,920
Duke Wei,

876
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,000
don't you think

877
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,720
this whole thing is odd?

878
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,880
What is odd about it?

879
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,720
This bastard must have been
plotting to do this for long.

880
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,080
How come it is odd?

881
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,200
Though Wang Yu

882
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,960
is frivolous and dissolute,

883
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,000
he only bullies
the weak and fears the strong.

884
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,720
If he was not abetted by others,

885
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,600
how dare he insult you?

886
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,920
Yes, that's right.

887
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,360
If I had known

888
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,480
you are Duke Wei,

889
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,440
I would never

890
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,480
have had the guts to do this.

891
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,800
Well.

892
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,760
It's Brother Ou.

893
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,240
No.

894
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,360
It's Ou Lixing.

895
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
It is he who incited me

896
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,920
to pester Lady Liansong.

897
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,520
It is true that another guy was with him

898
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,720
on that day.

899
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,400
Ou Lixing?

900
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,760
He has abetted this bastard

901
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,440
to humiliate my adopted daughter.

902
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,360
Could it be possible that

903
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
he aimed to turn me against you

904
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,640
in lifting the sea ban policy?

905
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,880
You saw him through.

906
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,400
While two dogs fight for a bone,
a third runs away with it.

907
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,320
I hope you

908
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
can put the general good first.

909
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,200
Some people

910
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,720
are going to every expedient.

911
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,520
How dare they

912
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,920
plot against me.

913
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,100
Be off.

914
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,760
Thank you, Duke Wei.

915
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,600
Father,

916
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,000
why did you allow him to
get away with it easily?

917
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,670
Thank you a lot for saving me, Marquis.

918
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,840
You heard what I said

919
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,840
just now.

920
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,230
I suggest that

921
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
you stay away from some people.

922
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,040
Are you referring to Ou Lixing?

923
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,840
But...

924
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,360
But why did he want to do harm to me?

925
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,600
There is no reason for him to do that.

926
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,360
If you had died today,

927
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,080
even if I wouldn't blame Ren Kun for it,

928
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,920
he would

929
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,600
be on guard against me

930
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,600
and the balance of power in the
royal court will definitely be affected.

931
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,800
By then,

932
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,800
the Ou family will attain their goal.

933
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,720
Do you think your Brother Ou

934
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,840
will offer incense to you

935
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,040
in front of your grave?

936
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,160
I have been wondering

937
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
why he has lowered himself

938
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,880
to ingratiate with me.

939
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,080
It turned out to be his conspiracy.

940
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,200
A word of warning for you:

941
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,120
Liansong is the adopted daughter
of Ren Kun.

942
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,720
Marquis,

943
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,800
I got it.

944
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,760
I got it.

945
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,000
I dare not do it again.

946
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,920
I never dare to do it again.

947
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,640
Did you cause

948
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,080
the wounds on Erniang's body?

949
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,720
Marquis.

950
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,800
In...

951
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,160
In fact, I just beat her once or twice.

952
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,080
But, I swear

953
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I didn't apply much strength.

954
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,360
A man should be a model for his family

955
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,640
and lead by example.

956
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,720
A man can't be said to be a real man

957
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,280
if he lays a finger on a woman.

958
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,080
Yes, you said the right thing.

959
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,040
I promise I will be nice to Erniang
from now on.

960
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,620
Giddy up.

961
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,580
Giddy up.

962
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,660
Giddy up.

963
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,360
Marquis.

964
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,680
I don't have a horse to ride.

965
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,600
Marquis.

966
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,480
Marquis.

967
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,480
Marquis.

968
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,040
Mother.

969
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,280
Mother.

970
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,960
Shiyi also has her difficulties.

971
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
You reprimanded her so severely
just now.

972
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,240
She must be feeling very sad.

973
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
At such a time,

974
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,520
I am not in a mood to mind her feelings.

975
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,400
If she really gets repudiated,

976
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,600
nobody will take care of

977
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,040
my poor grandson Zhun.

978
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,800
I have overestimated Shiyi.

979
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,040
I didn't expect

980
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,320
she would do such an improper thing.

981
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,920
Mother.

982
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,920
Don't be mad.

983
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
Anger will do harm to your health.

984
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
The physician said
you relapsed repeatedly,

985
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,160
and you can't worry too much.

986
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,520
Mother.

987
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,680
Don't be too anxious.

988
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,840
I think Great Madam Xu

989
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,120
must have misunderstood Shiyi.

990
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,440
When the Marquis is back,

991
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,320
he will certainly come
to take Shiyi back.

992
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,040
Yes, Mother.

993
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,280
Shiyi is not a reckless person.

994
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,520
She must have been wronged.

995
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,720
The Marquis is a sensible person.

996
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,440
I am sure he won't sit idle

997
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,400
and watch Shiyi suffer.

998
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,920
I hope so.

999
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,800
Your Ladyship,

1000
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,080
Wan Daxian is still looking for

1001
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,040
the whereabouts of Mingjing.

1002
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,280
But he hasn't found Mingjing.

1003
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,360
Mingjing is a key witness.

1004
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,200
Tell Wan Daxian to
continue looking for Mingjing.

1005
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,200
Since Qiao Lianfang has been alerted,

1006
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,480
she will definitely find ways
to send Mingjing away.

1007
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,120
I am afraid that

1008
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,280
Mingjing has gone out
of the capital.

1009
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
If we can't find Mingjing in the end,

1010
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,720
what should we do?

1011
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
How can we prove our innocence by then?

1012
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,720
Now what is worrying me is that

1013
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,160
even if we find Mingjing,

1014
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,320
he can't testify against Qiao Lianfang
without material evidence

1015
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,080
and we won't be able to

1016
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
prove her crime.

1017
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,720
Besides, he is Qiao Lianfang's
accomplice.

1018
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,480
If he testifies against Qiao Lianfang,

1019
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,480
he himself will be implicated.

1020
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,040
Dongqing, don't be so pessimistic.

1021
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
We still have His Lordship on our side.

1022
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,960
His Lordship will
surely believe Her Ladyship.

1023
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,600
Right. We can still
count on His Lordship.

1024
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,760
When His Lordship is back,

1025
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,360
all problems will be solved.

1026
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,800
Zhenxing.

1027
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,080
Take a seat, Zhenxing.

1028
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,800
What can I do for you, Shiyi?

1029
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,000
Zhenxing,

1030
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,440
could you help me with one thing?

1031
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,760
If I am of any help,

1032
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,040
don't hesitate to tell me.

1033
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,680
No matter what happens,

1034
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,840
I will be your brother forever.

1035
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,320
Zhenxing, you must have come to know

1036
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,000
that Xianling Pavilion got into trouble.

1037
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,600
Someone from the Qiao family

1038
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,480
was planted in Xianling Pavilion.

1039
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,720
She stirred up troubles in secret.

1040
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,960
But that girl

1041
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,600
vanished into thin air later.

1042
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
Could you help me

1043
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
find her?

1044
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,480
Since you are sure

1045
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,160
Qiao Lianfang has been
up to conspiracies,

1046
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,080
why don't you wait for
the Marquis to come back

1047
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,760
and tell him in his face?

1048
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,000
I have said everything

1049
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,920
before getting out of the Xu family.

1050
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,560
The rest will depend on
whether His Lordship believes me.

1051
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,240
Giddy up.

1052
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,680
Giddy up.

1053
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,360
Giddy up.

1054
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,920
Linbo, hurry to catch up with me.

1055
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,920
My Lord,

1056
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,760
why are you in such a hurry to go back?

1057
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,320
Is it because you are
eager to see Her Ladyship?

1058
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,480
Nonsense.

1059
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,160
Hurry up.

1060
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,340
Giddy up.

1061
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,500
(A fair place
produces outstanding people.)

1062
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,120
My Lord.

1063
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,400
My Lord, you are finally back.

1064
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,520
Something bad happened in the family.

1065
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,440
Great Madam had Her Ladyship

1066
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,280
sent back to the Luo Family.

1067
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,120
What happened?

1068
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,920
Great Madam blamed Her Ladyship

1069
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,200
for pretending to be pregnant.

1070
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,280
She also blamed Her Ladyship

1071
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,920
for deceiving the refugees
in Xianling Pavilion

1072
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,760
and capitalizing on them

1073
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,040
to trigger their rebellion.

1074
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,560
I heard the maids say that

1075
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,160
Her Ladyship also talked back to
Great Madam

1076
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,840
and almost forced Concubine Qiao
to commit suicide.

1077
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,480
My Lord.

1078
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,560
My Lord, do you believe

1079
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,800
Her Ladyship

1080
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,160
could have done such things?

1081
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,480
Her Ladyship is always kind.

1082
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,200
It is impossible for her

1083
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,440
to do such immoral things.

1084
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,220
Giddy up.

1085
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,100
Giddy up.

1086
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
My Lord.

1087
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,400
It's great.

1088
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,400
His Lordship must have come

1089
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,160
to take Her Ladyship back.

1090
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,880
Yes.

1091
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,840
Seeing His Lordship is back,

1092
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,320
we can finally

1093
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,560
feel relieved.

1094
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,040
Now Qiao Lianfang is dead meat.

1095
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,840
Hold your tongue.

1096
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,120
Let's speak and act cautiously.

1097
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,520
I didn't vilify her.

1098
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,920
Right. I don't have any evidence.

1099
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,240
But I am sure she is responsible for

1100
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,760
the death of Yuanniang.

1101
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,520
She didn't take action this time

1102
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,280
because she had sensed something.

1103
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,480
So it's true that
you didn't feel unwell.

1104
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,720
Instead, you have been deceiving Mother

1105
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,440
and I by design.

1106
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,240
I am at fault in this matter.

1107
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,640
But about Yuanniang's death,

1108
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,480
I have told the truth.

1109
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,000
My Lord, you can investigate it.

1110
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,440
As long as you investigate it,

1111
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,640
the truth will be revealed for sure.

1112
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,560
If you suspect Lianfang,

1113
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,440
you can discuss with me after I am back.

1114
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,600
Why did you act on your own?

1115
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,880
Why have you

1116
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,240
made such a mess of this matter?

1117
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,720
If I had accused Qiao Lianfang
of the crime

1118
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,800
without any evidence,

1119
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,000
would Mother have believed me

1120
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,720
and would you have believed me?

1121
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,760
Well...

1122
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,240
Stop looking.

1123
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,640
Go back to your work.

1124
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,680
My Lord.

1125
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,240
Your Ladyship.

1126
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,560
What happened between you two?

1127
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,240
His Lordship doesn't believe me.

1128
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
And he blamed me.

1129
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,400
Your Ladyship.

1130
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,760
How could His Lordship
treat you this way?

1131
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,720
If His Lordship

1132
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,560
doesn't believe Her Ladyship,

1133
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,000
who else will help us?

1134
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,520
Stop talking.

1135
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,920
His Lordship is in a fit of anger now.

1136
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,760
When his anger dies away,

1137
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,200
he will surely come to take
Her Ladyship back.

1138
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,560
Let's go. Let's go.

1139
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,960
As I see it, he won't come back.

1140
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,680
Enough.

1141
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,240
You have come to know the whole thing.

1142
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,760
Shiyi has committed crimes
and she should be repudiated.

1143
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,760
Lingyi.

1144
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,400
How will you deal with her?

1145
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,080
What's your suggestion, Mother?

1146
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,360
Our Xu family has been
on a journey of 100 uncommon years.

1147
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,560
We have run into
a violent storm on route.

1148
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,240
We follow the family rules strictly

1149
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,200
and are united as one.

1150
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,000
Thanks to this,
we achieved today's prosperity.

1151
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,880
However,
Shiyi neglected the family rules,

1152
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,440
abandoned her female virtues
and acted perversely.

1153
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,240
Our Xu family

1154
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,240
can't accommodate such an unruly woman.

1155
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Lingyi.

1156
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,560
I hope you can

1157
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,480
draw up the Divorce Agreement
as soon as possible.

1158
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,120
If I repudiate my wife
with things being unclear,

1159
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,280
won't I act too hastily?

1160
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,080
You still believe her words?

1161
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,000
You are not clear-minded now.

1162
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,040
You got confused by her.

1163
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,240
She accused Lianfang of the crimes

1164
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,560
without any evidence.

1165
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,320
But every crime she committed

1166
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,200
can be proven by solid evidence.

1167
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,720
How can you still
turn a blind eye to them?

1168
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,560
Though Shiyi did wrong things,

1169
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,480
I am responsible for

1170
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,720
failing to discipline her.

1171
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,240
So, Mother, please be lenient with her.

1172
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,600
Great Madam.

1173
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,000
Concubine Qiao is asking to see you.

1174
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,640
Let her in.

1175
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,240
What are you doing?

1176
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,120
I know His Lordship

1177
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,280
has come back.

1178
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,480
So I come especially to

1179
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,320
ask for punishment from
Great Madam and His Lordship.

1180
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,840
This disturbance

1181
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,920
was caused by me.

1182
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,040
I must have failed to show
Her Ladyship enough respect.

1183
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,040
As a result, she got suspicious of me

1184
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,520
and disrupted the peace of our family.

1185
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,600
It's my fault.

1186
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,920
I feel ashamed.

1187
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,440
Great Madam, My Lord,
I am willing to be punished.

1188
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,360
Lianfang.

1189
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,200
Why are you doing this?

1190
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,320
Lianfang,

1191
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,520
hurry to rise to your feet.

1192
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,240
You were blamed for things
you didn't do,

1193
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,800
but you swallowed all the humiliation

1194
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,680
and didn't hold any grudges.

1195
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,240
This is comforting.

1196
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,520
Though in the past,

1197
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,880
you've also done wrong things,

1198
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,720
you redressed your faults
after learning of them.

1199
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,480
So you are pardonable.

1200
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,040
Lianfang.

1201
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,040
From now on,

1202
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,080
I will count on you
to look after Lingyi.

1203
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,440
Yi'er.

1204
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,120
I know it is hard for you

1205
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,000
to put Shiyi behind you
for the time being.

1206
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,440
But she has made dreadful mistakes.

1207
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,800
If you persist defending her,

1208
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,920
how could we maintain the authority

1209
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,400
of the rules of our Xu family?

1210
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,680
How could we regulate our family
and rise in the world?

1211
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,240
Mother.

1212
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,240
Please allow me to think more about it.

1213
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,080
Allow me to excuse myself.

1214
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,720
Lingyi.

1215
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,040
When you are free, you'd better
go to the ancestral hall

1216
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,800
to read the ancestral teachings
and family rules.
