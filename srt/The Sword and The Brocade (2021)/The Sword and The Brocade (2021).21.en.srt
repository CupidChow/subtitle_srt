About the moldy rice incident

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,360
you asked me to investigate into,

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,640
I've found a lead.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
How did it go?

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,720
Is it serious?

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,120
I did what you said

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,200
and followed up the clue
we found in the rice shop.

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,560
It turns out that the barracks

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,720
are also plagued by moldy rice.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,520
Luckily,

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,760
the problem is not as serious as
in the soup kitchen.

Some soldiers in the army

have diarrhea.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,320
Luckily, for now,

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,750
there is no big problem.

It is crazy for Ou family

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,280
to make money at the expense of

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
the health of the soldiers.

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,800
With their health compromised,

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
we would be sending these soldiers to die

Thank you for asking.

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,000
Come on.

Grand Secretary Chen was frowning

and seemed thoughtful.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,200

Marquis,

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
you have no idea.

63
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,320
The rice for the military camps
was found to be moldy.

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,920
His Majesty was enraged

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
and has ordered Great Secretary Chen
to look into it.

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,280
today, Wang Zichuan of Ministry of Revenue

69
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
was suddenly arrested

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,200
and interrogated by Ministry of Justice.

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,680
Does this have to do with me?

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,760
Official Ou,

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,680
it was from the eunuch

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,600
that I got the news

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
of moldy rice

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,440
in the military camp.

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,800
Father, please forgive me.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
About the moldy rice,

79
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,760
it was my fault.

80
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,400
But I never meant

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,640
to disrespect you.

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
Everything I have done

83
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,240
has been for our Ou family,

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,520
for you.

85
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,440
Tell me about your fault.

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
I'm not smart enough.

87
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
I told you

88
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,880
not to make any big move

89
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,920
unless you've got to be sure.

90
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,520
If you didn't sell moldy rice

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
to Xu Lingyi,

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,360
how could he follow up the clue

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,160
and find out

94
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,720
the problems

95
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
in the military food?

96
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,760
He knew about it?

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
I sold Vice Minister Wang out.

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,200
Because His Majesty

99
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,000
has asked Grand Secretary Chen
to look into this.

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,040
I made him

101
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
your scapegoat.

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,240
Father, please don't be mad.

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
Father, you're in charge of
military affairs in the southeast.

104

Building good relationship with those
who support sea ban policy

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,920
can be expensive.

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
I did this

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,840
because I want to help you.

108
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
You're so stupid.

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Ministry of Revenue

110
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
has already been on Xu Lingyi's side.

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
You have no idea

112
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
what price I paid

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
to have Wang Zichuan planted

114
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
into the department.

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,880
After this,

116
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,520
Ministry of Revenue will treat us

117
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,280
as enemy.

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,880
Pick the brush up.

119
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
It has been a year

120
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,960
since Ou Yanxing left home.

121
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,640
We never heard from him.

122
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,880
Do you know where he went?

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,480
I have no idea.

124
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I heard

125
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
that he was heading up north these days.

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,760
I think he will come back
to the capital soon.

127
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,000
Let me know

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
as soon as he gets back.

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,320
You are excused.

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Aye, Father.

131
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
They look nice, don't they?

132
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Absolutely.

133
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,440
I need you

134
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
to send these boxes separately

135
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,320
to the wife of Duke Ning,

136
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,800
the wife of Marquis Zhongshan

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,600
and the wife of Earl Zuo'an.

138
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,080
Tell them

139
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,040
that these are new arrivals

140
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,880
of Treasures Boutique.

141
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
They are welcome to have it.

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Yes, Young Madam.

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Dear, you're back.

144
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,280
What happened to you?

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
Is there anything wrong?

146
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,600
They knew about the moldy rice.

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
Well, Father...

148
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,480
I was trying to use it

149
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,280
to win his favor.

150
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
However,

151
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,000
I fell into Xu Lingyi's trap.

152
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
My plan almost got ruined.

153
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
You told me

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,400
that it went well.

155
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Where did things

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
go wrong?

157
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Xu Lingyi's wife

158
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,680
meddled in the affairs

159
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
and upset the apple cart.

160
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,840
She is the illegitimate daughter
of the Luo family.

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,560
What can she do?

162
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
On the day of disaster relief
in the soup chicken,

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,880
if it weren't for her,

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
Xu family would not have made it

165
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,600
till Xu Lingyi's return.

166
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,640
Xu Lingyi got suspicious

167
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,360
and traced the source of moldy rice
to the military camp.

168
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,800
If it weren't for father

169
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,560
who decisively made his spy

170
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,360
in the Ministry of Revenue
the scapegoat,

171
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,080
the stakes would be high.

172
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,320
Hearing what you said,

173
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,800
I would like to meet

174
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
the wife of Marquis Yongping.

175
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Father

176
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,790
also mentioned Yanxing.

177
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,520
Why is this illegitimate son

178
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,960
always on father's mind?

179
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
He couldn't care less

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
about our family.

181
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,280
He would spend his days traveling around.

182
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,120
Speaking of his career,

183
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
he does nothing

184
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,480
but some unpresentable businesses.

185
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,120
I just don't get it.

186
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,680
Father just favors him.

187
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,880
In the capital,

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm the only eldest son

189
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,640
of a duke's legal wife

190
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,760
who is not appointed the heir.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Our family business is rooted
in the Ministry of War.

192
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,520
However, father sent me

193
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,440
to the Ministry of Rites.

194
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,120
Tell me.

195
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
Tell me why.

196
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,080
Dear,

197
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
as far as I'm concerned,

198
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
there is no need to worry about it.

199
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,840
Perhaps father

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,840
is using him

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,240
to sharpen your ability.

202
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,560
As for the appointment of the heir,

203
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,320
your father will after all

204
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,200
consider my father's feeling.

205
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
He won't appoint him the heir.

206
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,040
Dear,

207
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,720
now I can only

208
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
count on you

209
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
and your father.

210
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,320
My Lord.

211
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
You're back, My Lord.

212
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,600
You have a lot of work to do.

213
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,240
Please take care.

214
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,680
I will leave you to it.

215
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,400
Shiyi.

216
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,440
Ou family is behind

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
the issue of the moldy rice.

218
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,560
Oh.

219
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,680
You knew about it.

220
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Well...

221
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,920
We also found

222
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
that the moldy rice came
from the military camp.

223
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,560
Ou family was crazy enough
to embezzle army provisions.

224
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
His Majesty knew about it

225
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,440
and was enraged.

226
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,840
Marquis Jingyuan had to

227
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
wipe out his henchmen

228
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
in order to avoid punishment.

229
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,280
That's great.

230
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,080
This is not only about political dispute.

231
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,320
On a personal level,

232
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,320
you're protecting

233
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,120
Xu family.

234
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,400
On a greater level,

235
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,840
you're assisting His Majesty

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
in his clean-up.

237
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
This is going to matter to the whole country.

238
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,360
Refugees in the capital

239
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,640
are not settled yet.

240
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
Some may take advantage of the chaos.

241
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,840
You went out a lot these days.

242
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
Did you ever get into trouble?

243
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,360
No, I didn't run into any trouble.

244
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,920
Thank you for asking.

245
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,840
Given the fact that
you went out frequently,

246
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
you may need Wan Daxian,

247
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,640
who is good at martial arts,

248
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,560
to be your body guard.

249
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,080
In case of emergency,

250
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,400
he can protect you.

251
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,880
My Lord, that sounds nice.

252
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
I will consider it.

253
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
(Why is His Lordship)

254
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,080
(saying this to me?)

255
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,480
(Did he know)

256
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,800
(that I went to Xianling Pavilion?)

257
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,000
(If I tell him the truth,)

258
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,680
(what will he do?)

259
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,880
My Lord, actually, I...

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,560
My Lord.

261
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,760
Greetings, My Lord.

262
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,640
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

263
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,960
I was visiting Great Madam.

264
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,120
My Lord,

265
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,880
I need to talk to you about something.

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,480
Perhaps I should leave, My Lord.

267
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
My Lord,

268
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
do you know

269
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
what day it is?

270
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,800
So, what's the occasion?

271
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,320
It seems you forgot it.

272
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,400
Today is my birthday.

273
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,800
My apologies.

274
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
I've prepared a delicious meal.

275
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,080
My Lord,

276
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
please come tonight.

277
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm afraid you'll eat by yourself.

278
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,400
My Lord.

279
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,520
My Lord, it has been two years

280
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,160
since we got married.

281
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,760
I have always been alone in this house,

282
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,920
feeling lonely.

283
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,320
I wasn't meant to bother you.

284
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,800
But today,

285
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,600
when I visited Great Madam,

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
she mentioned

287
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,520
that today is my birthday,

288
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,800
and that I should

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,520
invite you to dinner.

290
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,040
That's why I...

291
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,400
(For them,)

292
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
(you are the only one they can rely on.)

293
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,520
(You can't always turn
a cold shoulder to them.)

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,440
All right.

295
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,800
That's great.

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,480
I shall begin making
arrangements at once.

297
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
I will be waiting for you tonight, My Lord.

298
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,760
Okay.

299
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,120
Come, come.

300
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,560
Nanny,

301
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,200
His Lordship spent about an hour

302
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,080
in Concubine Qiao's room before he left.

303
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,280
What now?

304
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,040
Has His Lordship gone to Her Ladyship?

305
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,080
His Lordship has returned to Banyuepan.

306
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,320
What is going on?

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,640
A while back,

308
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,400
His Lordship and Her Ladyship
were getting close.

309
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,480
How come

310
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,280
they are drifting apart these days?

311
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,120
Qiao Lianfang, that witch

312
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
must be playing the saboteur.

313
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,520
What's more,

314
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,080
there has been no news from Amber.

315
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,800
If things keep going this way...

316
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,640
What if...

317
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,720
What if she was pregnant
with His Lordship's baby...

318
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,440
Then...

319
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
No way, no way.

320
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,840
We must

321
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,760
let Madam Luo know about this.

322
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,720
That's right.

323
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,240
Madam Luo should know about this.

324
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,880
Today I skirted around the issue.

325
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,520
But Shiyi still would not tell.

326
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm not an unreasonable person.

327
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,320
Even if she tells me the truth,

328
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,160
I will never stop her

329
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,400
from teaching embroidery

330
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,840
at Xianling Pavilion.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,120
But why is she unwilling

332
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,840
to tell me the truth?

333
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,200
My Lord,

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
it happened many days ago.

335
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,520
You are still going over that.

336
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,400
Are you making fun of me?

337
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,720
I don't think I have the guts.

338
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,520
My Lord,

339
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,360
to go in another direction,

340
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
you may understand

341
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,280
why Her Ladyship kept
the truth from you.

342
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
To go in another direction?

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,760
Why would you

344
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,520
not let Her Ladyship know

345
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,160
that you already knew about it?

346
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,440
If you are worried about

347
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,440
what Her Ladyship thought,

348
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,360
you can have a talk with her.

349
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,400
I am not well-educated.

350
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,560
I don't know much.

351
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
But I'm pretty sure about one thing.

352
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,440
My Lord, if you want to understand

353
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,520
Her Ladyship better,

354
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,520
you should open

355
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,680
your heart first.

356
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,840
Otherwise,

357
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,280
there's always

358
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,000
an unbreakable wall

359
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,320
standing between you and Her Ladyship.

360
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
It seems you got plenty of them.

361
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,880
Yep.

362
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,480
I'll leave it here.

363
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,040
Sure.

364
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,680
Nanny Tao,

365
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
what brings you here?

366
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,560
Where is Dongqing?

367
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,520
She is in Her Ladyship's room.

368
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,310
Are you looking for her?

369
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,800
Not really.

370
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,240
I came to you.

371
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,960
Madam Luo

372
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,000
asked me

373
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,680
to give this to you.

374
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,760
This is...

375
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,240
This is my sister's embroidery.

376
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,880
Did Madam Luo find my sister?

377
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
How is she?

378
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,920
Madam Luo wanted me to tell you

379
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,200
that you must bear her words in mind

380
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,360
if you want to

381
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,760
meet your sister again.

382
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,280
His Lordship doesn't like Shiyi much.

383
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,960
She needs someone

384
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,840
to help her win the heart of His Lordship.

385
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,120
What would Madam Luo

386
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,240
want me to do?

387
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,680
Now you are

388
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,920
playing dumb?

389
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,040
At the very beginning,

390
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
you were sent by Madam Luo

391
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,400
to His Lordship,

392
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
don't you know that?

393
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,680
But how could we do this

394
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,720
to Her Ladyship?

395
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,800
This is not the time
to worry about others.

396
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,360
What matters most is

397
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,040
the interests of Luo family

398
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,920
and your sister's safety.

399
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
Do you understand?

400
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,680
Amber?

401
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,080
Dongqing.

402
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,480
What are you doing here?

403
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,440
Don't slack off.

404
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,280
Her Ladyship wanted you

405
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,120
to deliver these drawings to Master Jian.

406
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,320
Okay.

407
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,280
Master Jian,

408
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,440
this is the new pattern

409
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,840
designed by Her Ladyship.

410
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,000
Please check it out.

411
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,240
Thank you.

412
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,720
You're welcome.

413
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,320
This is my duty.

414
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,040
Amber,

415
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,600
please wait a moment.

416
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,600
Here you are.

417
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,440
This is...

418
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Just open it.

419
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,200
Shiyi

420
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,600
always thinks of you.

421
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,480
She often says

422
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,800
that you have come to the age

423
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,880
to marry a good man.

424
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
She has been preparing

425
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,080
your dowry.

426
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,440
Look,

427
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,520
she spared some time

428
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,440
to make a pair of
embroidered shoes for you.

429
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,560
Check if you like it.

430
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,880
Come.

431
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,520
Thank you, Master Jian.

432
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:14,920
Watch out.

433
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,240
Mr. Lin.

434
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,960
Amber.

435
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,480
You're here.

436
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,520
Where is Lady Luo?

437
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,520
She is not here today.

438
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
You look pale.

439
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,880
Are you ill?

440
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,680
What happened?

441
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I'm fine.

442
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,480
I don't think so.

443
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,240
You seem about to cry.

444
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,080
If you want to talk about your feelings,

445
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm here.

446
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,480
Mr. Lin, thank you for asking.

447
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,880
Actually,

448
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,360
it is about my sister.

449
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,640
Your sister?

450
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,400
What's up with her?

451
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,360
My parents died when I was a child.

452
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,560
It was my sister who brought me up.

453
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,640
It was always just the two of us.

454
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,160
Then I got sick,

455
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,400
and she sold herself to slavery

456
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,160
in order to get
the money for my treatment.

457
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,640
And nothing has been known
about her ever since.

458
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,960
I don't know where she is

459
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,120
and if she is well.

460
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,240
I don't know

461
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,440
when we can meet again.

462
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,360
Hey, don't cry.

463
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,040
Do you have any clue
about your sister?

464
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,880
I have many friends.

465
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,080
I might be able to help you with that.

466
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,320
My sister was sold

467
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,520
to a rich family.

468
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,760
Perhaps

469
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,080
she has changed her name.

470
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,240
There has been no clue.

471
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,320
Sometimes I feel

472
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,120
that there is nothing I wouldn't do

473
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,360
as long as I get to see her again.

474
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,280
I won't regret

475
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,760
even if

476
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,760
I'll have to betray my heart.

477
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,640
It is normal for us

478
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,160
to miss our close kin.

479
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,040
I understand that.

480
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,880
But I don't think you will do that.

481
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,680
No matter what,

482
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,400
you will stay true to yourself.

483
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,400
Mr. Lin...

484
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,200
I just got a string of prayer beads

485
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
from Baiyun Temple.

486
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,760
It is believed to bring people
good luck and happiness.

487
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,640
I'll give it to you.

488
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,600
May you find your sister soon.

489
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,360
Mr. Lin,

490
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,720
I can't accept

491
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,120
a gift this precious.

492
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
This is not expensive.

493
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
May you find inner peace.

494
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,660
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

495
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,160
Your Ladyship,

496
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,640
I've been wanting

497
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,600
to say this for a while.

498
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,440
It pains me

499
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,720
to keep it to myself.

500
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,920
What are you trying to say?

501
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,240
I remember

502
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,320
how I thought of you

503
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,280
as someone like Lady Erniang

504
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
when Madam Luo

505
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,120
sent me to serve you.

506
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,880
However,

507
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,760
it turns out that you are
so smart, kind, forgiving

508
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,640
and admirable.

509
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,400
Tonight,

510
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,120
you said so many good things about me.

511
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,720
Are you asking me to lend you money?

512
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,480
Your Ladyship,

513
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,440
there is one thing that I don't understand.

514
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,200
Why would you

515
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,840
let you guard down with me

516
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,320
all the while knowing

517
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,360
that I work for Madam Luo?

518
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,200
Have a seat.

519
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,160
This mansion

520
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,560
may look fancy.

521
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,520
However, people living in it

522
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,520
may have their own miseries.

523
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,400
I let down my guard with you

524
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,800
because I know

525
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
that you are a good girl.

526
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,600
And that you never plot against me.

527
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,920
That's why

528
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,360
I want to protect you.

529
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,720
Your Ladyship,

530
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,480
I must have done great things

531
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,920
in my past life

532
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,040
to meet someone like you.

533
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
You're a good person.

534
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,520
I will be punished if I ever do

535
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,960
something harmful to you.

536
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,960
Amber,

537
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,800
is there anything wrong?

538
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,120
What happened to you?

539
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,880
Perhaps the cold wind

540
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,680
made me feel ill.

541
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,120
In that case,

542
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,320
you don't need to accompany me

543
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,520
to Xianling Pavilion tomorrow.

544
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,600
Stay at home and have a good rest.

545
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
Don't make your cold worse.

546
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,240
What's the matter?

547
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,040
Nothing.

548
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,320
You have been so nice to me.

549
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,680
I am really touched.

550
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,280
Your Ladyship, you're going to
Xianling Pavilion tomorrow morning.

551
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,000
You might want to have an early night.

552
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,560
I should leave.

553
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
Dear sister...

554
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,060
(Mansion of Xu)

555
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,800
My Lord.

556
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,880
Amber?

557
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,960
What are you doing here?

558
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
Her Ladyship asked me

559
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,880
to send some chicken soup to you, My Lord.

560
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,120
Just leave it there.

561
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,800
Anything else?

562
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,480
My Lord,

563
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,400
you might want to drink it while it's hot.

564
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,880
I'll do it myself.

565
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,800
My Lord,

566
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
are you tired?

567
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
Do you want me

568
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,280
to rub your shoulders?

569
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,440
You...

570
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,680
Did Her Ladyship ask you
to send the soup?

571
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,600
Not really.

572
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,880
Her Ladyship does not know about it.

573
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
I came here myself.

574
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,040
Whatever you ask me to do,

575
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
I will

576
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,640
do it.

577
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,040
Get out of here.

578
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,000
Zhaoying.

579
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,040
My Lord.

580
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Send Amber back.

581
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,080
Hand her over to Shiyi

582
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,200
when she is back.

583
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,720
Amber, please go with me.

584
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,200
Your Ladyship...

585
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,560
What's wrong?

586
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,320
Does His Lordship not like the soup?

587
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,280
What's going on here?

588
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,360
I got soup

589
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,080
on my clothes

590
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,200
when I was cooking.

591
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,840
I got changed.

592
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,880
I asked Amber to deliver the soup

593
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,440
before it gets cold.

594
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,760
This is my workplace.

595
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,280
It is not a place
where everyone has access to.

596
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,120
Next time, you are expected
to deliver it yourself.

597
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,960
Those who don't obey the rule

598
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
shall be got rid of.

599
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,000
I need her.

600
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,640
And I would hate to dismiss her.

601
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,680
You need her?

602
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,560
Amber is a smart and

603
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,840
thoughtful girl.

604
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,560
I don't need to tell her my thoughts.

605
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,880
Yet she understands me.

606
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,440
How could I live without her?

607
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,080
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

608
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,400
Amber,

609
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,160
apologize to His Lordship.

610
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
My Lord, please forgive me.

611
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,600
I was being impolite.

612
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,240
All right.

613
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,880
This is not happening again.

614
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,040
You're excused.

615
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,080
Yes, Your Ladyship.

616
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,600
My Lord, sorry for interrupting your work.

617
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,720
Have a taste of the soup, My Lord.

618
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,920
Your Ladyship.

619
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,200
Your Ladyship...

620
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
Your Ladyship, how could you know...

621
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,240
What you said yesterday

622
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,800
and your illness this morning

623
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,520
made me suspicious.

624
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,160
Dongqing told me

625
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,080
that Nanny Tao went to you yesterday.

626
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,080
I thought about it

627
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,120
and figured that Madam Luo

628
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,840
was about to make her move.

629
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,600
Your Ladyship,

630
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,880
I got separated from my sister
when I was a child.

631
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,480
Madam Luo is the only person

632
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,160
who knows where my sister is.

633
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I have no choice
but to follow her words.

634
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,160
You should have told me.

635
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,000
I couldn't.

636
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,400
I was afraid that Madam Luo

637
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,360
would harm my sister.

638
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,480
Your Ladyship,

639
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,920
I never wanted to

640
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,150
betray you.

641
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,360
Of course,

642
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,710
I know you didn't mean it.

643
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,280
You won't dress like this

644
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,520
if you really have an ulterior purpose.

645
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,150
Today,

646
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,480
you are more plainly dressed than usual.

647
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,190
You don't even wear your hairpins.

648
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,000
And

649
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,600
you look pale.

650
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,190
Should I keep going?

651
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,880
Your Ladyship,

652
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,670
if I really want to seduce His Lordship,

653
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,480
it will cause great harm to you

654
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,560
no matter I succeed or not.

655
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,230
You have been so nice to me.

656
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,680
I can never do this to you.

657
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,840
So,

658
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,440
you pretended to
have followed Madam Luo's words.

659
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
But you were actually

660
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,600
planning to disgruntle His Lordship

661
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
and get kicked out of the mansion.

662
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,320
That way, you did it
without offending Madam Luo

663
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,960
or betraying me.

664
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,000
Am I right?

665
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,360
You're a good person.

666
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,040
In my life,

667
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,760
besides my sister,

668
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,480
no one has treated me as you do.

669
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,040
So,

670
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,960
Your Ladyship,

671
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,760
I will never hurt you.

672
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,080
So, what are you going to do now?

673
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,360
If you really want to leave here,

674
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,800
I can help you.

675
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,960
But it would really mean a lot for me

676
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,040
if you stay.

677
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,640
Your Ladyship,

678
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,840
through this,

679
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,240
I realized

680
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,560
what I should do.

681
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,920
From now on,

682
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,000
no matter I get to meet
my sister again or not,

683
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,840
I will be true to my heart.

684
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,680
I will not be threatened by anyone.

685
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,040
I trust you, Your Ladyship.

686
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,680
From now on,

687
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I will be loyal to you.

688
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,840
Hey, don't kneel down.

689
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,480
I said it before.

690
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,800
I said

691
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,280
that you two

692
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,560
are more than maids to me.

693
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,880
From now on, we will support each other.

694
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,680
No matter what,

695
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,240
we will never betray each other.

696
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Never betray each other.

697
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,120
It turns out

698
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,920
Amber has her own reasons.

699
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,920
I never trusted her before.

700
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,800
I was wrong about her.

701
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,360
She is a poor girl.

702
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,320
We should help her.

703
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,960
Ask old servants back home

704
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,200
about her sister.

705
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,480
Maybe we can get some clues.

706
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,880
Remember,

707
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,880
be careful.

708
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
Madam Luo can't know about it.

709
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,320
I know.

710
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,360
By the way,

711
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,000
it turns out His Lordship

712
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,680
is a perfect gentleman.

713
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,600
I think His Lordship loves you only.

714
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,800
Come on.

715
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,400
It seems you make everything
about His Lordship.

716
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,280
I got it right.

717
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,000
I used to think of His Lordship

718
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,160
as a lecherous person

719
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,600
because he had affairs with Concubine Qiao.

720
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,640
It has been a while
since we lived in Mansion of Xu.

721
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,120
Let alone Concubine Qiao,

722
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,360
His Lordship barely visits Concubine Wen

723
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,720
and Concubine Qin.

724
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,960
It seems

725
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,800
His Lordship is a little bit callous.

726
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,280
Don't you say that.

727
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
Aloof as he is,

728
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,600
His Lordship is not a callous person.

729
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,920
He is just not into

730
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,560
domestic dissention.

731
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,000
As far as I'm concerned,

732
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,560
you know His Lordship

733
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,280
better than anyone else does.

734
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,840
He gave me his heart,

735
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,560
and I would give him mine.

736
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,620
(Xianling Pavilion)

737
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,280
The wife of Marquis Zhongshan

738
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,600
will be holding a banquet three days later.

739
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,600
Ladies in the capital

740
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,160
are all invited.

741
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,160
For this banquet,

742
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,560
Shiyi,

743
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,640
I want you to go with me.

744
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,040
I want to take this opportunity

745
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,080
to introduce you to others.

746
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Sure.

747
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,880
Mrs. Du.

748
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,080
This is

749
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,240
female guest registry

750
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,120
for the banquet.

751
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,080
I want you to memorize it.

752
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes, Mother.

753
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,160
This is your first time

754
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,640
to attend such an occasion

755
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,680
as the matron of Xu family.

756
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Remember,

757
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,200
behave appropriately.

758
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,280
Those ladies

759
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,600
have sharp eyes.

760
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
Sure, Mother.

761
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,840
I will work on it.

762
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,160
That's right.

763
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,120
You are all excused.

764
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,440
Yes.

765
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,000
Mrs. Du,

766
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,640
Shiyi seemed to be calm,

767
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,560
with no trace of pride or panic.

768
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,040
It was Lianfang

769
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,100
who disappointed me today.

770
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,540
Great Madam,

771
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,020
let's not jump to the conclusion yet.

772
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,560
We should

773
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,320
see what will happen.

774
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,980
(Marquis Zhongshan's Mansion)

775
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,060
(Marquis Zhongshan's Mansion)

776
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,360
This way, please.

777
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Great Madam Xu, you're here.

778
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,720
This way, please.

779
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,120
Great Madam Xu.

780
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,240
Great Madam Xu, you're here.

781
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,520
Welcome, welcome.

782
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,080
Madam Tang,

783
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,880
you've met her.

784
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,840
This is my fourth daughter-in-law.

785
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,960
Greetings, Madam Tang.

786
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,440
Greetings, Madam Xu.

787
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,680
Let's get inside.

788
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,360
There are all my friends inside.

789
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:58,920
Let's go.

790
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,480
Great Madam Xu, you're here.

791
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,600
Great Madam Zheng.

792
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,440
Greetings, ladies.

793
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,520
Let me introduce

794
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,280
my fourth daughter-in-law to you.

795
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,000
It has been so long.

796
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,320
Your daughter-in-law

797
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,120
has become even more gorgeous.

798
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,960
It seems

799
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,560
your mansion is a good place to live.

800
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,200
I owe it all

801
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,680
to Mother

802
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,880
who has treated me nicely

803
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,680
and helped me out.

804
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,680
Great Madam Zheng,

805
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,720
you look as radiant as ever.

806
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,200
It seems the Duke's Mansion

807
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
is an even better place to live.

808
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,680
Exactly.

809
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,080
Mother

810
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,720
is getting prettier

811
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,560
day by day.

812
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,880
Now I see why.

813
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,840
You are making fun of me,

814
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,640
aren't you?

815
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,360
All right.

816
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,320
Let's get inside.

817
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,600
Come on, let's go.

818
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,240
This way, please.

819
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,080
This way, please.

820
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,720
The madam over there

821
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,280
is the wife of Minister Zhou
of Ministry of Rites.

822
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,000
She is talking

823
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,440
to her daughter,

824
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,480
who is the wife of Ou Lixing,

825
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,080
the eldest son of the legal wife

826
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,760
of Ou family.

827
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Be careful

828
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,280
when you talk to her.

829
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,360
Yes, Mother.

830
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,480
His Lordship told me

831
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,120
about the relationship
between Ou and Xu families.

832
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,120
All right.

833
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,680
I will be talking

834
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,680
with my old friends.

835
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,880
I was talking about

836
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,240
a beauty over there.

837
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Young Madam Ou, it turns out
you are that beauty.

838
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,320
That's right.

839
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,360
You look so stunning today.

840
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,360
I couldn't resist

841
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,880
staring at you.

842
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,520
Thank you for saying that.

843
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,680
You must be Madam Xu.

844
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,840
Greetings, Young Madam Ou.

845
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,440
I heard that Madam Xu

846
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,480
is good at

847
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,560
running the house,

848
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,520
and taking good care

849
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,560
of Xu family.

850
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,920
I do admire that.

851
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,520
Meeting you today,

852
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,480
I find Madam Xu

853
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,760
is a young lady.

854
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,000
Young Madam Ou, you're giving me
far more credit than I deserve.

855
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,360
I was just handling

856
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,680
family affairs.

857
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,600
Isn't Marquis Yongping's mansion amazing?

858
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,400
It has been a while since we last met.

859
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,040
Shiyi, your aura

860
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,480
has even changed.

861
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,960
Greetings, Erniang.

862
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,200
This is the wife of Wang Yu,

863
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,760
the heir of Duke Mao.

864
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,520
She is also a daughter of Luo family.

865
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,200
You'd think

866
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,200
she is the daughter

867
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,560
of someone's legal wife.

868
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,160
Look at the flower blossoms.

869
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,240
I heard that Young Madam Ou

870
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,640
is a connoisseur

871
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,400
who knows a lot
about flowers and plants.

872
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Would you give me a few pointers?

873
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,320
Young Madam Wang,
you do me too much honor.

874
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,160
I'm not an expert in the field.

875
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
I just know a thing or two about it.

876
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,080
Look at this flower.

877
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,720
It is scarlet,
with numerous layers of petals.

878
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,280
This is...

879
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,360
Madam Xu,

880
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,440
I believe you know

881
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,280
what the flower is.

882
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,280
It is a very rare color.

883
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,360
Madam,

884
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,080
do you think

885
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,960
you are more knowledgeable

886
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,400
than the wife

887
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,200
of Marquis Yongping?

888
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,440
Great Madam, should we...

889
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,240
Young Madam Ou,

890
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,920
I beg to differ.

891
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,200
Everyone has his own
strengths and weaknesses.

892
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,240
Nobody is omniscient.

893
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,800
It is just a flower.

894
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,240
What difference does it make

895
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,680
if I don't know its type?

896
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,320
Even if I know, does it
make me superior to others?

897
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,800
It turns out that

898
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,080
being the wife of Marquis Yongping

899
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,920
makes no change

900
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,880
to one's lowness and shallowness.

901
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,720
You're pathetically ignorant.

902
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,440
Don't refer to yourself

903
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,200
as the daughter of Luo family.

904
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,840
As far as I'm concerned,

905
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,200
one brings shame to the family

906
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,960
when she plays against
her own family members.

907
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,080
Erniang.

908
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,480
Madam Xu,

909
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,200
I beg to differ.

910
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,240
We should admit our ignorance.

911
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,520
How could you

912
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,080
sugarcoat it?

913
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Is it what you learned

914
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,760
from Xu family?

915
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,960
People can always learn from each other.

916
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,360
Confucius did not feel ashamed
to ask the two kids

917
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,920
when he saw their debate.

918
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,720
If we don't know something,

919
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,920
we can always ask.

920
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,360
It is not something to be ashamed of.

921
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,560
Now I see.

922
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,280
Madam Xu, you're
comparing yourself to a saint.

923
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,520
Young Madam Ou, I'm no match for you

924
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,120
when it comes to

925
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
taking things out of context.

926
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
Why not admit that
you don't know this flower?

927
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,320
Why keep beating around the bush?

928
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,760
In spring, there are
peach and plum blossoms.

929
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,480
The scent of cymbidium comes with wind.

930
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
The redder the flower is,

931
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,720
the more precious the cymbidium is.

932
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
Though the color is rare,

933
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,320
the flower is not unique
to prestigious families.

934
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,920
It can also be found in merchant families.

935
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,200
It is nothing but an ornament.

936
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,880
I know its type, but what's the point?

937
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,280
Merchant families?

938
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,440
How can you mention
our family and merchant families

939
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,000
in the same breath?

940
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,040
Red cymbidium is rare.

941
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,960
But people with ulterior motivations

942
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,400
are not rare.

943
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,120
Orchid is a noble plant.

944
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,960
Not everyone is qualified

945
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,480
to comment on it.

946
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,880
If it falls into

947
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,720
the filthy hands,

948
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,360
its nobleness

949
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,480
will be defiled.
