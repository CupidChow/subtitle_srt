19
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,760
Your Ladyship.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,080
It's late.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,800
Should we prepare

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,080
His Lordship's bath?

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,920
Should we or should we not?

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,480
Rest early then.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,400
I won't bother you.

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
You're not bothering me.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
I'll see you out.

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,280
You're so happy for me to leave.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
No.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm just thinking

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
that you're busy with work.

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
I can't make you stay long.

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,040
Yes, I'm busy with work.

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,160
Take care, My Lord.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Your Ladyship, weren't you
and His Lordship

36
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,400
chatting so nicely just now?

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
Why won't you let him
stay overnight?

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,040
Right, Your Ladyship.

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,080
Dongqing is right.

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,120
After all, you've already married
into the Xu family.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,280
If you and His Lordship's relationship

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,040
don't get improved,

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,680
this can't go on for long.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
Don't worry about it.

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,160
I know what to do.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,080
My Lord.

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,640
Didn't I tell you already?

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,520
I must finish working

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,880
on the documents tonight.

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,320
Why did you put them away?

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,760
I heard that you

52
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,920
would stay in Western Lateral Court,

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
so I thought you
wouldn't be back tonight.

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
I'm not done with my work yet.

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
Why would I stay
in Western Lateral Court?

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,640
-Could Her Ladyship...
-You're still asking questions?

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,280
Madam.

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,120
His Lordship didn't stay
in Western Lateral Court.

59
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,280
He went back to his place.

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
It seems like

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,320
even if Her Ladyship is managing
the household affairs,

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,520
she still didn't get His Lordship's favor.

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,240
This time,

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,240
I defeated

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
Concubine Qiao effortlessly.

66
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,080
In the future,

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
I must win over

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
Her Ladyship.

69
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,720
The Wen family

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,000
can overturn its situation soon.

71
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,080
Last time, she received
20 tael of silver,

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,560
and she was so happy.

73
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,920
She should be very easy to deal with.

74
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,680
She's still an illegitimate daughter
after all.

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,440
Even if she's managing
the household affairs now,

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,320
she still

77
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,880
hasn't seen much of the world.

78
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,960
Here, Madam.

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
More or less, we all

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,120
have looked down on and offended
Her Ladyship.

81
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,960
I wonder

82
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,440
how she'll deal with us.

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,960
Right.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,320
What are you worried about?

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,080
Her Ladyship just started managing
the household affairs.

86
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
She doesn't know anything.

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,040
It's the time for her to win us over.

88
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
Besides, last night,

89
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,040
His Lordship went to her court,
then left.

90
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
It's obvious that Her Ladyship

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
doesn't have His Lordship's
favor at all.

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
She wouldn't dare to do anything.

93
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
Seriously?

94
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Everyone, please follow me.

95
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,680
Mrs. Li.

96
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,800
Yes.

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
You manage the maids

98
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,880
and servants in the mansion.

99
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,440
Their dispatch, monthly salaries,

100
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,800
and rewards and punishments are clearly
recorded in the accounting books.

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm rewarding you
with two tael of silver.

102
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,120
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

103
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
Thank you.

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,800
Mrs. Wang.

105
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
You're in charge of the purchasing
in the kitchen.

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,160
In the accounting books,

107
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,920
for the kitchen's monthly expenses,

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,360
the prices of the stores you bought from

109
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,880
for expensive food items

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,760
such as ginseng and bird's nest

111
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,680
are 30 percent higher
compared to other stores.

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
What is going on?

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
Your Ladyship is unaware.

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,800
Their items

115
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,200
are much better than the other stores'.

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
In that case,

117
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,480
do you dare to compare the items you got

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,320
with the other stores'?

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,440
Well...

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,000
Mrs. Zhou.

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
You're in charge

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,840
of the silk, satin, and clothing
for four seasons.

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,200
You decide

124
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
which embroidery shop

125
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,200
and which thread shop to buy from.

126
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
Do you want me to calculate

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
all the kickbacks

128
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,320
you got from them?

129
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,840
Your Ladyship.

130
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Your... Your Ladyship.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,280
You don't have any proof of that.

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,800
You can't speak irresponsibly.

133
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,400
I can't take the responsibility

134
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,880
for that charge.

135
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,640
Speak irresponsibly?

136
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
Even if I haven't managed
household affairs before,

137
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,480
I was poor when I was little.

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,080
I must calculate

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
each needle, thread,

140
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,120
fabric, and clothing I spend on.

141
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,280
If you think

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,440
that I am the daughter

143
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
of an eminent family,

144
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,200
who is pampered and doesn't know

145
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
how to read accounting books,

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,120
you're wrong.

147
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
You two

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,040
deceived your masters and deluded
your subordinates to fill your pockets.

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,600
Since you've been working
in the Xu family for a long time,

150
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,120
I can let bygones be bygones.

151
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
But starting today,

152
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,800
let others

153
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,480
do your jobs.

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,320
Your Ladyship.

155
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,040
Wait a minute.

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,960
Without the two of us,

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,840
won't the Xu family
fall into chaos then?

158
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,960
I've already arranged for new people

159
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
to take the positions

160
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,760
you were occupying.

161
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,360
Whether the family will fall
into chaos or not

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,480
isn't your concern anymore.

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,800
Your Ladyship.

164
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,240
Please be kind.

165
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,160
I'm already kind enough

166
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,560
not to punish you.

167
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,400
If you can't accept it,

168
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,360
we can all go

169
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
and speak to Great Madam.

170
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,920
Well...

171
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
Everyone.

172
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,760
You may go.

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,560
I...

174
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,800
Let's go.

175
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,000
Your Ladyship, look.

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
These are the records of the fabrics

177
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
that went out from the warehouse.

178
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,880
If not for the convenience
of our investigation,

179
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,680
I don't want

180
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,520
to do the thankless task

181
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
of managing household affairs.

182
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,600
With these,

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,320
can we really find clues

184
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,760
about that embroidery fabric?

185
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,120
Since there was a similar fabric
in the villa,

186
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,440
we just need to find out

187
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,360
who have

188
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,920
used these fabrics

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,120
before last year's Dragon Boat Festival,

190
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,120
then follow the clues,

191
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,520
and we can surely find something.

192
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
How strange.

193
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
What's the matter, Your Ladyship?

194
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
There's a record of purchasing

195
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,560
huge amounts of silk and satin
in the household.

196
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
It was when Yuanniang was still alive.

197
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,000
Since Concubine Qiao

198
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,400
started managing the household affairs,

199
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,960
she started buying

200
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,920
the silk and satin

201
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,040
from Zhang's Silk and Satin.

202
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,520
This is

203
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
not a small expense.

204
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,880
Didn't the Wen family

205
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,720
lose a lot of money then?

206
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,920
Based on Concubine Wen's personality,

207
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,560
she surely wouldn't just take that.

208
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
Would Concubine Wen

209
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,520
take revenge against
Concubine Qiao then?

210
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm afraid she already did.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,280
Forget it. Let's not mind her first.

212
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
Let's continue checking.

213
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,640
I found it.

214
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,440
Take a look.

215
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,120
It... It says here

216
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,360
that during the Dragon Boat Festival
last year,

217
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,120
Princess Danyang,

218
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,320
Concubine Wen, and Concubine Qiao

219
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,400
took those fabrics.

220
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,800
That means

221
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,520
the killer

222
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,960
should have something to do with them.

223
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Who could it be then?

224
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,120
But this kind of fabric

225
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,559
isn't the type of grand fabric

226
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,600
that women like.

227
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,360
It's more suitable
to make an inner garment

228
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,559
or perfume satchels and the like.

229
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,679
During the Dragon Boat Festival,

230
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
women would usually make

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,720
perfume satchels for the one they love.

232
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,080
The one they love?

233
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,360
His Lordship and Master Lingkuan?

234
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,360
Right.

235
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,760
We never found any clues

236
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,120
from the female members
of the family before.

237
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,440
Perhaps we can find something
through His Lordship

238
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,280
and Master Lingkuan.

239
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,280
If we can find

240
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
the items that they gave out,

241
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,600
we can surely find some clues

242
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,640
to know who the real killer is.

243
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,840
I noticed that the wisdom
of three ordinary people

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,320
can outwit a genius.

245
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm not ordinary.

246
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,240
You are.

247
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,000
My Lord.

248
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Are you going to bathe here tonight?

249
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Your Ladyship, it's late.

250
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,000
Should we prepare

251
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
His Lordship's bath?

252
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,040
Why are you so clumsy?

253
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
Don't you see that I'm working?

254
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,560
I'm sorry, my hand slipped.

255
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,320
Never mind.

256
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,640
Grind the ink for me.

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,160
Why did you add so much water?

258
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
My writing will bleed at the edges.

259
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
My Lord, if you think

260
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,720
that I'm not serving you well,

261
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,760
I

262
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,680
will find a meticulous maid
to serve you.

263
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,640
All right, you're tired too.

264
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Go and rest.

265
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,360
Yes, My Lord.

266
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
General Fu.

267
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,760
General Fu, why are you here?

268
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,320
His Lordship is in a bad mood.

269
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,400
He kept getting angry.

270
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,520
I can't do my job anymore.

271
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,720
General Fu, if it's not urgent,

272
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,480
don't go inside.

273
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,480
I don't have any urgent matters.

274
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,720
But why is His Lordship

275
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,000
in a bad mood?

276
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,920
Two days ago, he came back
from Western Lateral Court

277
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,040
and became this way.

278
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,080
Western Lateral Court?

279
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,160
It's related to Her Ladyship?

280
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
His Lordship is angry at Her Ladyship?

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't dare to gossip
behind His Lordship's back

282
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,680
about his affairs with Her Lordship.

283
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
You won't tell me the whole story.

284
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,960
That's so annoying.

285
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,040
I suddenly remember that I forgot

286
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,120
to instruct the kitchen about something.

287
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,880
Wait for me.

288
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,120
I'll be right back.

289
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,480
She always says that I'm careless.

290
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,960
She's the same.

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
(Let me scare Amber.)

292
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,840
General Fu.

293
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,120
Why is it you?

294
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm the one who should ask you
that question.

295
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,920
It's late at night.

296
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,400
Why are you

297
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,360
sneaking around here?

298
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,760
You're the one who's sneaking around.

299
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,840
This is the Mansion of Xu.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,160
Why are you here so late at night?

301
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,240
Hey.

302
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,840
Instead of admitting your mistake,
you're accusing me.

303
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,040
And are you a dog?

304
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Why did you bite me?

305
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,160
You're the dog.

306
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,640
You flung yourself at me.

307
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,360
You're at fault,
and you won't apologize.

308
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
You're even being so stubborn.

309
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,800
If you want to blame me,

310
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,560
go and tell Her Ladyship

311
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,640
about me.

312
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,280
There's no need.

313
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,960
I won't argue

314
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,080
with a girl.

315
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
However,

316
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
don't tell anyone about this.

317
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,960
Are you scared

318
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,440
that if people find out

319
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,760
that you got scared because of me,

320
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,800
it will ruin your reputation?

321
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,880
That's nonsense.

322
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,080
You didn't scare me.

323
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,680
Then why did you shout just now?

324
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,640
I...

325
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
I shouted

326
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,560
because I was directing my qi
to a part of my body.

327
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,440
The qi of those who practice martial arts
is in the diaphragm.

328
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,400
Don't you know that?

329
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,640
You won't get it even if I told you.

330
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,840
Dongqing.

331
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,480
Dongqing.

332
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:23,800
I'll go ahead.

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,720
Don't tell anyone about it.

334
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,880
Otherwise, I won't spare you.

335
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,960
Dongqing.

336
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,200
Who were you talking to just now?

337
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,320
No one.

338
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,920
A dog.

339
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,280
A dog ran by.

340
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,200
A dog?

341
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,680
Our yard has a dog again?

342
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,720
No.

343
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,440
It's too dark. I didn't see it clearly.

344
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,560
Perhaps it was a cat.

345
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,280
A scaredy cat.

346
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
All right.

347
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,160
Let's go back.

348
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,520
Her Ladyship should be hungry.

349
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,600
Why are you here?

350
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,840
I made some pastries and soup

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,640
to nourish you, My Lord.

352
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,040
Place them over there.

353
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,720
My Lord, what are you reading?

354
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm writing a report
to comfort the refugees.

355
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,920
I've heard that the refugees
often gather together

356
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,520
and cause troubles.

357
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,560
What if

358
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,040
we move them out of the city
as soon as we can,

359
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
and let them stay in a nearby village?

360
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
There's flooding everywhere.

361
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,160
The villages can't accommodate
so many people.

362
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,560
I'm afraid there will be casualties.

363
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,960
Natural disasters and man-made
misfortunes are unavoidable.

364
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,920
It's better than letting them stay
in the capital,

365
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
creating bigger trouble,

366
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
and infuriating His Majesty.

367
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,320
How can the lives of those citizens

368
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,680
compare to your future?

369
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,920
My Lord.

370
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,520
The soup will get cold.

371
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,960
Drink it while it's hot.

372
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,600
Lately,

373
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,080
Mother's been having leg pains again.

374
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,440
I'm going to visit her.

375
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,240
What a coincidence.

376
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,480
I made a pair of knee pads,

377
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,840
and I wanted to bring it to her.

378
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,560
Let's go then.

379
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

380
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,480
Great Madam.

381
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,520
I made these knee pads for you.

382
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Look at you two.

383
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
You're so concerned

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,960
about my health.

385
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
It's what I should do.

386
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,800
Before, I made a mistake,

387
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,680
and you didn't blame me.

388
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
I'm lucky.

389
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480
I should be filial to you.

390
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,080
Originally, I was worried

391
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,800
that you'd feel bad

392
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,800
because of the management
of household affairs.

393
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,160
Now, I see it.

394
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,760
I see that you are

395
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,720
broad-minded.

396
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,000
Lingyi.

397
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,720
You must take care

398
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,440
of Lianfang more.

399
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,880
I'm sorry to worry you, Great Madam.

400
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,400
Aside from you,

401
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,920
His Lordship is my priority.

402
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,079
I think about him every moment
of every day.

403
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,280
What a good child.

404
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
However,

405
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,560
don't always think about me.

406
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,280
Think more

407
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,960
about how to give descendants
to the Xu family.

408
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
Lingyi.

409
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,240
Don't just be busy

410
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
with work all day.

411
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,400
You must think of Lianfang

412
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,960
and visit her more.

413
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,480
How is it?

414
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,440
Your Ladyship.

415
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,480
His Lordship and Concubine Qiao

416
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,000
are in Great Madam's room now.

417
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,840
At this hour,

418
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,600
Great Madam will surely

419
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
ask them to stay and eat.

420
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,040
That's great. This way,

421
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
we'll have enough time to do things.

422
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,920
Let's go.

423
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,640
This one

424
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,240
is your favorite design.

425
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,880
I embroidered it for three days.

426
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
You spent so much effort on it.

427
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,760
Look at these threads.

428
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,840
They're lined up so well.

429
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,560
Mother.

430
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,880
Grand Secretary told me

431
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,440
to present the disaster relief report
to His Majesty as soon as I can.

432
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,720
I'll go ahead.

433
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,280
Wait.

434
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,680
It's meal time.

435
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
You and Lianfang should stay

436
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,640
and eat with me.

437
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,200
It's livelier if more people are here,

438
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,280
and it makes my food taste better.

439
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,480
The disaster is a matter
of great urgency.

440
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
I'll eat with you next time.

441
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,600
How stubborn.

442
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,320
Great Madam.

443
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,040
Is His Lordship

444
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,560
not willing to forgive me?

445
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,400
Don't think that way.

446
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,280
That's how he is.

447
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
You must take more initiative.

448
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,840
Yes, Great Madam.

449
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,320
Your Ladyship, why are you here?

450
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,960
His Lordship isn't here now.

451
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,800
That's fine.

452
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,880
I'm planning to make new clothes

453
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,840
for His Lordship.

454
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,520
I just need to get a sample.

455
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,240
I see. Please come in.

456
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,400
What are you looking at?

457
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,600
My Lord.

458
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,360
Aren't you eating

459
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,000
at Great Madam's?

460
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,080
I have work to do.

461
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,640
My Lord, Her Ladyship is inside.

462
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,640
Make a pot

463
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
of jasmine flower tea from His Majesty.

464
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,920
My Lord.

465
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,840
Didn't you complain

466
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,720
that it was too weak and sweet?

467
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,240
Did I say that?

468
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,720
Yes, My Lord.

469
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
(Why aren't these the same?)

470
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,000
What are you looking for?

471
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,440
My Lord.

472
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,560
I originally wanted to
make a few clothes

473
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,640
for you,

474
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,960
so I came to get a sample

475
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,120
to get your size.

476
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Just let the embroiderer

477
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,160
take care of such trivial matters.

478
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,960
I'm being too nosy then.

479
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
I won't disturb you.

480
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,040
The old clothes' size

481
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,480
might not be suitable anymore.

482
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,600
Measure me directly.

483
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,840
You're the one who didn't want me
to make one.

484
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,400
Now, you want me to make one.

485
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
Since you have a lot of time,

486
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,320
it's also good

487
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,160
for you to make a couple of clothes
to kill some time.

488
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Why are you still standing there?

489
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,200
Hurry up.

490
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,440
Yes.

491
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
May I use your pen and paper?

492
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,000
They're over there.

493
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,739
(Chest Length)

494
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,760
Your regular script in small characters
are nice.

495
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,600
The thickness is just right.

496
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,440
It's forceful and gentle
at the same time.

497
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,600
Are you done with the measurements?

498
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,480
Not yet.

499
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,480
By the way, My Lord,

500
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,480
how are the refugees now?

501
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,320
Has the government found a way

502
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,720
to make arrangements for them?

503
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm actually worrying about that now.

504
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,360
It's easy with men.

505
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
Now, pirates are still a problem.

506
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,880
Banditry is still continuing.

507
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm planning to let them join the army.

508
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,560
Not only can they fulfill the army needs
of the government,

509
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,920
they can also get salaries

510
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,680
to support their families.

511
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,040
As for those who aren't willing
to join the army,

512
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,320
they can learn some skills
with the artisans

513
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,560
in the military.

514
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,160
Give a man a fish and feed him for day;

515
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,480
teach a man how to fish
and feed him for a lifetime.

516
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,880
But it's not convenient

517
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,800
to place women in the army.

518
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,600
I can't think

519
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,200
of a better arrangement for them
at the moment.

520
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,360
My Lord.

521
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,640
What if you recruit the female refugees

522
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,040
to the embroidery workshops?

523
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
Embroidery workshops?

524
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,520
I heard from Master Jian

525
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,520
that due to the disaster,

526
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,560
there is a high demand
for cotton and linen.

527
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,400
But there aren't enough staff
in the embroidery workshops.

528
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,560
The demand exceeds the supply.

529
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,680
What if we ask Master Jian

530
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,840
of Xianling Pavilion

531
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,040
to work with the major
embroidery workshops

532
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,760
and recruit these female refugees?

533
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,600
This way,

534
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,280
not only will they fill up
the manpower vacancy,

535
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,960
they'll also be taught a skill.

536
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
When they go back to their hometown

537
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,080
after this disaster,

538
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,680
they'll also have a skill
to earn a living.

539
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,480
In that case,

540
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
that's a good idea.

541
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,320
Even if the details

542
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,600
still need to be ironed out,

543
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,840
it's very feasible.

544
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,840
That's one merit for you.

545
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,280
What should I reward you with?

546
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,320
I just randomly thought about it.

547
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,360
I don't deserve a reward.

548
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,080
You handle things in a proper manner,
and you know how to give and take.

549
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,560
If you were a man,

550
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,120
you'd surely accomplish great things.

551
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,760
Can't a woman

552
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,280
accomplish great things too?

553
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,400
My Lord.

554
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,600
The sunlight is glaring.

555
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,600
I didn't see anything.

556
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,440
I'll leave right away.

557
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,760
Don't go.

558
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,040
I'm just preparing to leave.

559
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,920
I've already got your size.

560
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,560
I'll make

561
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,000
the new clothes as soon as I can.

562
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,600
I'll go ahead.

563
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,920
Your Ladyship.

564
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,600
This is jasmine flower tea
given by His Majesty.

565
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,880
His Lordship heard
that it was produced in Suzhou,

566
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,160
which is close to your hometown,

567
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,040
so he asked me to make this for you.

568
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Thank you, My Lord.

569
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,680
But I don't really like the sweet taste

570
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
of flower teas.

571
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,360
It would be such a waste

572
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,200
to give me such good flower tea.

573
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,360
So Your Ladyship also doesn't like

574
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,640
what His Lordship dislikes.

575
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,160
When did I say that I dislike it?

576
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,640
Then this flower tea...

577
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,680
Drink it yourself.

578
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Thank you, My Lord.

579
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,480
It's good.

580
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
You don't know how to appreciate it.

581
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,200
My Lord.

582
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
Even if we don't have solid proof
about the moldy rice incident,

583
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,840
all signs show

584
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,240
that it's related
to the Ou family indeed.

585
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,200
Marquis Jingyuan went
to the southeastern region

586
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,480
to make military inspections.

587
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,040
The moldy rice

588
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,360
was most likely Ou Lixing's doing.

589
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
His objective was to let the Xu family

590
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,160
lose the government's trust.

591
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,000
The Ou family did so much evil.

592
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,680
We can't let them get away with it.

593
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
But how should we investigate this next?

594
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,480
They got so much moldy rice.

595
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,960
Even if they gathered it

596
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,920
from all the grain shops in the capital,

597
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,760
they wouldn't be able to get it
so quickly.

598
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,640
Think about it.

599
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,000
Where else

600
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,720
can they hoard

601
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,440
such a huge amount of grains?

602
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,960
Imperial grains?

603
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
I'll go and check Nanxin Storage.

604
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,680
Come back.

605
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,960
Among the imperial grains,

606
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,800
if they dare to provide
such a huge amount of moldy rice,

607
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,760
the Ministry of Revenue's officials

608
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,080
would have long been dead.

609
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,920
Then... Where else

610
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,920
can it be?

611
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,320
My Lord, General.

612
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,320
Registrar Liu wants to report
some military affairs.

613
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,200
Let Assistant Commissioner Li handle it.

614
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,360
Yes.

615
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,160
Army grains?

616
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm just afraid that they won't
make a move.

617
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
If they do...

618
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,440
My Lord, you're quite happy lately.

619
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,200
Is it related to Her Ladyship?

620
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,000
Did Zhaoying say something again?

621
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,560
Before, you came back

622
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,520
from Her Ladyship's

623
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
with a bad mood.

624
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,440
Later on, after Her Ladyship

625
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,720
came to your place,

626
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,120
your mood improved.

627
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,880
My mood

628
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,120
has nothing to do with others.

629
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,480
Fine, it has nothing to do with others.

630
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,560
However,

631
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,080
I must still say something.

632
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,680
Regardless how Her Ladyship

633
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,640
offended you before,

634
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,360
since she's already

635
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,440
reconciled with you,

636
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,480
You might go with the flow.

637
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,880
A harmonious family will prosper.

638
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,920
Tell me.

639
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,040
What kind of tea would someone

640
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,520
who doesn't like flower teas prefer?

641
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,760
What?

642
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,520
Nothing.

643
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,360
Wen, what are these for?

644
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,520
These are just a token
from my sister-in-law.

645
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,040
She wanted to come

646
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,480
and greet you.

647
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,000
Those are just presents from her.

648
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Your Ladyship, I wonder if you

649
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,800
has some time?

650
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
Is His Lordship aware of this?

651
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,200
His Lordship is busy with work.

652
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,440
We shouldn't disturb him.

653
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,360
So my sister-in-law

654
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,960
wanted to come here first

655
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,240
to greet you.

656
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,280
Thank you.

657
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,960
But it's not easy for her

658
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,200
to come all the way here.

659
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,800
Let's wait for His Lordship
to have some time

660
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
and meet together.

661
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,120
Your Ladyship.

662
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,200
The Luo and Wen families

663
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
are based in Jiangnan.

664
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,880
We should take care of each other.

665
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,520
People from the two families

666
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
meet frequently.

667
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,240
There are many chances
to work together in business.

668
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,240
Your Ladyship, you don't need
to be concerned.

669
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,040
You're too kind.

670
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,440
I'm part of the Xu family now.

671
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
If the Wen family

672
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,360
wants to collaborate
with the Luo family for business,

673
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
you should talk to my brother.

674
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,200
Your Ladyship.

675
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,120
The flooding this year is very serious.

676
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,720
Medicines to prevent illnesses

677
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,560
are surely very in demand.

678
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,800
The Wen family

679
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,720
has always wanted to do business
related to that.

680
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,480
It was just difficult to find connections.

681
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,880
They want to work with you on it.

682
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,760
You don't need to worry about anything.

683
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,360
You can surely get a bonus every month.

684
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,520
At least

685
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,720
this much.

686
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,960
My third brother said

687
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,000
that the late Her Ladyship's portion

688
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,960
will be given to you too.

689
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,560
Well,

690
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,360
I just started managing
the household affairs.

691
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,800
I'm not very well-versed

692
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,040
in business matters.

693
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,360
Besides,

694
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,960
this concerns Yuanniang.

695
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,760
I should ask His Lordship about this.

696
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,600
Well...

697
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,360
Well, it won't be easy

698
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,480
if His Lordship finds out.

699
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,760
You know that it won't be easy
if His Lordship finds out.

700
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,160
Why are you still doing it?

701
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,280
Actually,

702
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,520
thanks to you,

703
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
last time,

704
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,160
we found out
about the moldy rice just in time.

705
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,480
Your Ladyship.

706
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,160
What do you mean?

707
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,000
After Concubine Qiao managed
the household affairs,

708
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
she replaced the Wen family's
silk and satin.

709
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm afraid you were

710
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,080
under a lot of pressure.

711
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,800
Your Ladyship.

712
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,840
I'm a very practical person.

713
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,680
There's only one motto

714
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,120
for the Xu family's purchasing
in the future.

715
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,560
We will buy from the one who can provide

716
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000
cheap and good quality products.

717
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,160
But if someone creates trouble
because of this,

718
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,080
according to the Xu family's rules,
she won't be spared easily.

719
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,160
Your Ladyship is right.

720
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,440
I understand now.

721
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,120
She really said that?

722
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,880
There was great flooding this year.

723
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,000
If we sell medicines,

724
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,680
we'll surely make a lot of profit
using a small capital.

725
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,720
We can earn at least

726
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,160
700 or 800 tael of silver.

727
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,280
Why would someone be willing

728
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,800
to pass up a sure thing?

729
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,440
I thought it was strange too.

730
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,000
She's obviously someone

731
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,640
who would feel ecstatic

732
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,880
with just 20 tael of silver.

733
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,280
Today, so much money

734
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,440
was placed in front of her,

735
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,120
and she didn't care at all.

736
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
Not only that,

737
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,640
it seems she already knows

738
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,200
that I was the one who disclosed

739
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,160
the moldy rice to her.

740
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,880
I don't care about that.

741
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,160
That's your problem.

742
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,040
Deal with it yourself.

743
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,800
Don't forget.

744
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,320
In order to get you married
into that family,

745
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,880
the Wen family spent so much money.

746
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,440
If you don't get this done,

747
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,240
don't think about getting

748
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,960
any bonuses this year.

749
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,480
Madam, don't be angry.

750
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,400
You've already married
into the Xu family.

751
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,360
What can the Wen family do to you?

752
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,000
If I am doing this for myself,

753
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,680
I don't need to be so concerned.

754
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,800
But I'm doing this

755
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,200
for Yu's sake.

756
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,480
Yu is an illegitimate son.

757
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,960
He can't get the marquis position
in the future,

758
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
and he won't inherit many assets.

759
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,000
If he wants to establish himself
in the capital in the future,

760
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,240
he must rely on the Wen family.

761
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,240
If nothing else works,

762
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,360
plead with Her Ladyship.

763
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,920
After all, why wouldn't anyone be moved

764
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,520
with so much money?

765
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,960
Is she more arrogant

766
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,320
than the late Her Ladyship?

767
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,760
She's different
from the late Her Ladyship.

768
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,440
Even if the late Her Ladyship
was arrogant and cold,

769
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,800
she was considering Zhun

770
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,400
and the Luo family.

771
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,200
Merchants like us

772
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
are least scared of that kind of person.

773
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
But Shiyi

774
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,040
has a sharp mind and is immune
to both hard and soft tactics.

775
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,880
She's not easy to deal with.

776
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,920
She knows

777
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,480
that you disclosed the moldy rice to her.

778
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,600
Will that affect you?

779
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,520
I don't think she has any proof.

780
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,800
Otherwise,

781
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
she wouldn't

782
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,520
just say those things today.

783
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,040
She used His Lordship to stop me,

784
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,600
yet she's not aware

785
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,639
that when the late Her Ladyship

786
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,760
did business with us before,

787
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,600
His Lordship secretly knew about it too.

788
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,719
His Lordship defended the late Her Ladyship

789
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,120
and blamed me instead

790
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,880
for causing chaos in the household.

791
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,000
He didn't consider

792
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,360
that even if it was my idea,

793
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,400
it would only work
if the late Her Ladyship agreed.

794
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
To put it bluntly,

795
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,760
the late Her Ladyship was a legal wife,

796
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,320
and I am just a concubine.

797
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,080
My Lord.

798
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,960
I checked already.

799
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,800
As you've predicted,

800
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Young Madam Wen wanted Concubine Wen

801
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,280
to invite Her Ladyship
to join their business.

802
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,680
However,

803
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,840
Her Ladyship rejected the Wen family.

804
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,360
The Wen family's business is big.

805
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,760
She didn't hesitate at all?

806
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Indeed.

807
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,800
Her Ladyship doesn't seem
to be interested.

808
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,240
They're both from the Luo family,

809
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,480
yet she's so different from Yuanniang.

810
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,200
My Lord.

811
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,560
Go and inform the twelve
government offices

812
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,360
that the Xu family isn't involved
in the business of selling medicines.

813
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,200
If Wen family uses the Xu family's name,

814
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,040
tell them to handle it.

815
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,440
Yes.

816
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,680
Have you bought back

817
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,400
the dowries that Shiyi sold

818
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,360
for the disaster relief?

819
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,960
My Lord, I took care
of those already.

820
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Go to the accounting department.

821
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,680
Use my name

822
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,200
to give some money to Shiyi.

823
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,200
Say that it's for her regular expenses.

824
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes.

825
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,640
Why am I so lucky lately?

826
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,720
Everyone's giving me money.

827
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,840
Your Ladyship.

828
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,720
His Lordship said

829
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,520
that the Xu family deals
with a lot of people.

830
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,520
You also needs to use money
in a lot of things.

831
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,120
That was why he asked me

832
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,120
to bring these.

833
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,320
I get a monthly allowance.

834
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,280
I don't need money.

835
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,200
You do.

836
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,400
Who says you don't?

837
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,480
Thank you, Steward Bai.

838
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
You can bring them back.

839
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,640
Tell His Lordship

840
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,800
that I appreciate his kindness.

841
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,040
Your Ladyship, this is according
to His Lordship's instructions.

842
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
This will make things difficult for me.

843
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
There's no need to feel that way.

844
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,680
Just tell His Lordship

845
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,800
that I said so. I can't take
undeserved rewards.

846
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,120
Well said.

847
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,720
My Lord.

848
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,560
My Lord.

849
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Don't forget.

850
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,320
As the Xu family's matron,

851
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,880
It's unavoidable

852
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,840
to meet guests and entertain them.

853
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,400
If people see

854
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,680
that you don't have money,

855
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,600
I'm the one who will be embarrassed.

856
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,640
Besides, you made a huge accomplishment

857
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,400
for the Xu family regarding
the disaster relief.

858
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,560
Why do you say
that you don't deserve a reward?

859
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,640
Yes, Your Ladyship.

860
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,560
I think what His Lordship said
makes sense.

861
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,320
You have many things
to take care of in the future.

862
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,680
Money makes the world go round.

863
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,680
In that case,

864
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,000
I'll accept it.

865
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,600
Thank you for your kindness.

866
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,280
You have more money

867
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
to give to me?

868
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,480
Take a look yourself.

869
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
These are...

870
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,320
For the sake of the disaster relief,

871
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,240
you used these land titles
to gather rice.

872
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,360
You were decisive,

873
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,960
and resolved the crisis for the Xu family.

874
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,080
I appreciate it very much.

875
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,560
But you shouldn't use your dowry

876
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
to support the Xu family.

877
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,360
However,

878
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,240
why are there more land titles?

879
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,960
Your lands

880
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,640
were scattered.

881
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,160
They're mostly not good farmlands.

882
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,680
I told Steward Bai

883
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,920
to buy the farmlands

884
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,280
around them as well,

885
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,680
so that your scattered farmlands

886
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,640
will be connected together.

887
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,240
The harvest will be better too.

888
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,920
My Lord.

889
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,120
I was just doing what I should.

890
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,600
You spent a lot of money.

891
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
We're husband and wife.

892
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,200
Why do you act like an outsider?

893
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,040
Zhaoying.

894
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,200
I'm not going back to have lunch.

895
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,560
I'll eat here today.

896
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,800
Yes, My Lord.

897
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Wait.

898
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,560
Why are all these sweet?

899
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,040
Her Ladyship likes
the sour and sweet taste,

900
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,880
so the kitchen

901
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,800
would usually send these
to Western Lateral Court.

902
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,840
Go and tell the kitchen

903
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,800
to make other dishes.

904
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,800
I'm afraid His Lordship aren't
used to these.

905
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,720
Yes.

906
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,840
My Lord, I'm sorry.

907
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,240
I like Yuhang dishes,

908
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,280
so these are what the kitchen prepared.

909
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,280
But I've already asked them

910
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,080
to prepare the dishes you like.

911
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,640
I suddenly decided to eat here
at the last minute.

912
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,520
It's not your fault.

913
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,400
Then, My Lord,

914
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,800
try this sweet and sour fish.

915
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
Why would anyone like dishes

916
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,440
made from syrup?

917
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,960
If someone likes it,

918
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,880
that means it has its good point.

919
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,040
Tell me about that.

920
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
This sugar and vinegar sauce

921
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,240
is where the essence of this dish lies.

922
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,000
Regardless if it's the heat

923
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,480
or the speed of cooking this dish,

924
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
they must be just right.

925
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,280
It's delicious.

926
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,000
This fish looks very ordinary.

927
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,680
Why do you like it?

928
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,840
Because it's delicious.

929
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,640
And look.

930
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,600
It's a very ordinary food.

931
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,320
Yet after precise and careful cooking,

932
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,080
it became

933
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,680
a unique flavor.

934
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
And I think

935
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,960
that in many things,

936
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,600
it doesn't matter
if it's expensive or not.

937
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,440
Even if it's just very simple,

938
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,240
as long as we make an effort
to notice it,

939
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,720
it has its unforgettable aspects.

940
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,040
When all things started,
complicated things were unbelievably simple.

941
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,400
One dish

942
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,800
can even make you realize
important things in life.

943
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,960
How does it taste?

944
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,240
It's sour, sweet and delicious.

945
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,200
It's unique indeed.

946
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,520
Then try

947
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,760
this Longjing shrimp.

948
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,800
Not bad.

949
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,680
It's fine. We have enough dishes.

950
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,480
You may go.

951
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,520
By the way,

952
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,040
how are the clothes

953
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,720
you're making for me progressing?

954
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,440
(Oh, no.)

955
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,480
(I just made a casual remark back then.)

956
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,080
(I didn't expect
that he'd still remember.)

957
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm still making them.

958
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,520
If you're in a hurry,

959
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,920
I'll finish them in the next few days

960
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:23,960
and bring them to you.

961
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,120
It's fine.

962
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,480
I just

963
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,800
haven't worn new clothes for a while.

964
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,040
You're well-built.

965
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,560
You'd look good in anything you wear.

966
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,400
Didn't Great Madam

967
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,240
just send a couple
of clothes over yesterday?

968
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,440
(You're well-built.)

969
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,760
(You'd look good in anything you wear.)

970
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,400
My Lord.

971
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,680
Is there anything wrong
with these clothes?

972
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,120
It's fine.

973
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,120
Why did you come here?

974
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,680
Dinner is ready.

975
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,360
Sweet and sour fish?

976
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,600
I saw how happy you were
when you had it at lunch,

977
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,400
so I asked the kitchen to make it.

978
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,000
If you don't like it,

979
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,080
I'll take it away.

980
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,280
It's delicious.

981
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,760
It doesn't taste right.

982
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,520
The same cook

983
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,840
made the sweet and sour fish dish

984
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,560
for Her Ladyship at lunch time.

985
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,360
Take it away.

986
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,160
I think what you liked wasn't the fish,

987
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,160
but the one you ate it with.

988
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,080
My Lord.

989
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
