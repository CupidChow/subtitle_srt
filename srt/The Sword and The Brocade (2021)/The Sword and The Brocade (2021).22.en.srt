are not rare.

have happened to Ou family recently.

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,840
Young Madam Ou,
you must've had a hard time.

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,440
The banquet will begin soon.

33

Let's go.

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,840

Great Madam Xu, you are here.

-Madam Tang.
-Please.

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,840
Madam Tang,

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
thank you for inviting us.

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,200
I hope

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,000
you'll like the food.

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,440
They are all nice dishes.

-Let's sit down.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
-Sit.
-The dishes smell and look so good.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,480
Hope you'll enjoy the food.

-How have you been doing?
-Good.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,640
You look so good today.

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,800
-Not bad.
-Thank you.

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
Young Madam Ou, you are here.

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,040
Daughter, come here

53
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,440
and greet the madam.

00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,240
Please sit down.

Thank you.

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,270
I'm in good health.

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,720
-Everything's fine.
-Sure.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,320
Yes.

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,560
It looks so nice.

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Now, let's eat.

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
-Okay.
-Okay.

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,800
Great Madam Zheng, try this.

64
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,280
This looks good.

65
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,800
Erniang, how have you been doing?

66
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,680
I've been doing very well.

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,080
You should mind your own business.

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
Why do you care about me?

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Just enjoy being
the wife of the Marquis.

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,240
Erniang.

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,760
Here, taste this.

72
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,400
Okay.

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,560
What happened to you?

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,440
It's none of your business.

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,160
Erniang.

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,720
Erniang.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Erniang.

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
What happened?

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,400
How did your wrist get hurt?

80
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,200
Look. There are wounds everywhere.

81
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,440
Are you happy now?

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,600
Wang Yu hit you?

83
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,880
How dare he treat you like that?

84
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,160
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,440
Tell you?

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
Don't pretend anymore.

87
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
If you hadn't replaced me
to marry the Marquis,

88
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,320
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

89
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,440
I replaced you?

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,320
Do you know

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,120
why my mother would go

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
to Ci'an Temple on that day?

93
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
Because I was going to
run away from the wedding.

94
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,440
Hadn't you set up a trap for me

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,040
and asked Madam Wang to keep me home,

96
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,640
we would've left
the capital long time ago.

97
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,480
In that case,

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
you could've married

99
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,920
into Xu family,

100
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,640
and my mother wouldn't have been...

101
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,360
What?

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,680
You mean back then...

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
You mean you wanted to...

104
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,360
You wanted to run away
from the wedding?

105
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,360
No.

106
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,840
I don't believe you.

107
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
You are lying.

108
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,360
There's no way that you didn't

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,840
want to marry the Marquis.

110
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,400
How could I use

111
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,080
my mother's death to lie to you?

112
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,640
Erniang, think about it.

113
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
Have I ever fought you

114
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,040
over anything since we were little?

115
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,440
I just wanted to marry into
a wealthy family.

116
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,720
I just wanted to live with pride

117
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,040
for the rest of my life.

118
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,280
What have I done wrong?

119
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Why do I have to end up like this?

120
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
Erniang,

121
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,720
just let bygone

122
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,280
be bygone.

123
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
Where there's a will, there's a way.

124
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
Our fates are

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,920
in our own hands.

126
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,360
That's right.

127
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,200
You look so much better lately.

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,880
Yes.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
So do you.

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,280
Has she visited you?

131
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,840
Yes.

132
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,680
How did it come out?

133
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,040
Very nice.

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,760
Is it okay?

135
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
Yes. Very pretty.

136
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,360
Madam Xu.

137
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
Young Madam Ou.

138
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,200
I notice that the embroidery
on your cuffs

139
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,320
is quite unusual.

140
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,000
Would you mind me asking

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,760
where you got it?

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,800
Just some embroidery.

143
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
Why are you so curious, Madam Xu?

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,720
Please don't get me wrong.

145
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,640
I learned embroidery for a few years.

146
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,030
So when I see something new,

147
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,320
it makes me interested.

148
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,120
Madam Xu, you have quite a taste.

149
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,080
The embroidery on
Young Madam Ou's clothes

150
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,640
is indeed rarely seen in the capital.

151
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
We all envy her.

152
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,320
No need to envy.

153
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,720
Our fabric

154
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,440
is all brought back

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,880
by Zunzhang from the south.

156
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,000
If you like it,

157
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
I'll give you some tomorrow.

158
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,320
Then I'll thank you in advance,
Young Madam Ou.

159
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
You are welcome.

160
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,480
The embroidery is surely different,

161
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
but I'm so tired of looking at it.

162
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,280
I do wanna try

163
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
something else.

164
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,640
The ladies I know

165
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,400
are all frequent customers
of Xianling Pavilion.

166
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
It's said that Master Jian
of Xianling Pavilion

167
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,800
has excellent embroidery skills.

168
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
Xianling Pavilion?

169
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,640
I've heard of it.

170
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,780
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,320
Dear,

172
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
what are you looking for?

173
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,880
Where are you going with the money?

174
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,040
Young Madam.

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
You think you can stop me?

176
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,440
Dear.

177
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,040
(Erniang,)

178
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,360
(just let bygone be bygone.)

179
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
(Where there's a will, there's a way.)

180
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,680
(Our fates are)

181
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,920
(in our own hands.)

182
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,880
Dear,

183
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,240
I lied to you before.

184
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,280
It's my bad.

185
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,520
I know I was wrong.

186
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,920
I promise I'll serve you well
in the future.

187
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,680
Let's start over

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,560
and live a good life together,

189
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,200
okay?

190
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,040
Live a good life?

191
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,160
Sure.

192
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,040
As long as you let me have Baizhi,

193
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
I'll give you a good life.

194
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,640
Dear.

195
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,680
Baizhi has got engaged.

196
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,280
She'll get married next month.

197
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,680
I can't do that to her.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
Dear.

199
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Father

200
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,680
punished you because

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,360
you raped a girl.

202
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
If Father gets mad at you again

203
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,880
because of this,

204
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,000
you'll be in trouble.

205
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Don't try to scare me with my father.

206
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,400
You can't even do this for me,

207
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,280
and you want a good life?

208
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
Young Madam.

209
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,200
What should we do, Young Madam?

210
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,680
Don't be afraid.

211
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,080
Just wait till next month
and get married.

212
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,960
I won't

213
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,200
put you in misery.

214
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,920
Young Madam.

215
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,520
Shiyi,

216
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,760
you are wrong.

217
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
It's the way it is now.

218
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,920
Nothing can be changed.

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Don't. Don't.

220
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,480
My Lord.

221
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,800
How much did His Lordship drink?

222
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
Don't ask. Just get him back first.

223
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,560
My Lord.

224
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,920
Let's go.

225
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,200
Come on.

226
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,760
Hold on. Hold it.

227
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Where are you going?

228
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,320
Back to Banyuepan.

229
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:30,960
Look.

230
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,720
His Lordship is so drunk.

231
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,760
Why take him back to Banyuepan?

232
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,720
General, you are indeed wise.

233
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,400
Let's go.

234
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
The Western Lateral Court is this way.

235
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,200
Come on.

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,480
This fan is so pretty.

237
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,000
That's right.

238
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,800
Look

239
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,920
how shiny and colorful it is.

240
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,480
Don't.

241
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,240
My Lord.

242
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,440
What happened to him?

243
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

244
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,440
His Lordship had a drink
with a few friends

245
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,480
and he got a little drunk.

246
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,440
He just needs some rest.

247
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,240
But why do you bring him here?

248
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,600
His Lordship is drunk like this.

249
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,480
We think that it's

250
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,240
better for Your Ladyship

251
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,280
to take care of him.

252
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,080
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

253
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Don't. Don't. Don't.

254
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Your Ladyship,

255
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,840
we'll take off now.

256
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,200
Your Ladyship,

257
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,960
I'll go boil some water.

258
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,800
I'll go chop firewood.

259
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,160
Don't. Dongqing. Amber.

260
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,240
My Lord.

261
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,160
How is...

262
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,520
Don't... Don't.

263
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,440
My Lord. I...

264
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,160
Put me on the bed.

265
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
Go over there.

266
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
I'll go boil some water.

267
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,280
You stay here.

268
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll go prepare His Lordship's

269
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,320
clothes for tomorrow.

270
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,560
What are you doing, General Fu?

271
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,040
Don't hit me so hard.

272
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,480
It's late already. Won't you go back?

273
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,200
His Lordship will
finally sleep here tonight.

274
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,360
Aren't you curious?

275
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,040
Why would I be curious about
my masters' matter?

276
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
I'm a disciplined maid.

277
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,640
Okay. Alright.

278
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,880
You are so heavy.

279
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,200
Don't move.

280
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:26,840
You...

281
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,920
My Lord. My Lord.

282
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,920
Don't move.

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,040
Let me clean your face.

284
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,880
Thirsty.

285
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
Water.

286
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,480
I want tea.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,080
Wait a moment.

288
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,960
I want tea.

289
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,080
Here it is.

290
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,240
Bring your Marquis
freshly brewed Longjing tea.

291
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
Go on.

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,920
Hurry.

293
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,120
You are so drunk,

294
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,560
yet you still remember
you are a Marquis.

295
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,720
I'll go get it for you.

296
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,920
Get under the blanket.

297
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,960
Why can't I hear anything?

298
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,960
Go brew some Longjing tea.

299
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,160
Hurry.

300
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,880
Where are you?

301
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,320
Hurry.

302
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
Hurry. Hurry.

303
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
Yes, Your Ladyship.

304
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,400
Freshly brewed Longjing tea.

305
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Hurry.

306
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
Hurry.

307
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,440
Hurry.

308
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,240
Where are you?

309
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,360
Hurry.

310
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,440
My Lord, here it is.

311
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,400
It's hot.

312
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,400
You said that you wanted
freshly brewed Longjing tea.

313
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,800
Alright. I'll cool it down for you.

314
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,560
I'll cool it down.

315
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,160
My Lord. Don't move.

316
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,080
Noisy.

317
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,960
Noisy.

318
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
Noisy.

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,280
Okay. Alright.

320
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,680
Just sleep. Sleep.

321
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,400
He's actually cuter than usual he is.

322
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,640
Great Madam,

323
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,280
is it a little late

324
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,800
to visit Concubine Qiao?

325
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,280
It's not.

326
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,400
Today, I brought Shiyi

327
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,640
to Marquis Zhongshan's Mansion
for the banquet

328
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,560
so as to introduce her

329
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,040
to all the distinguished families

330
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,800
in the capital.

331
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,280
I think

332
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,040
Lianfang

333
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
must feel upset about that.

334
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
I have to check on her.

335
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,720
Great Madam, don't worry.

336
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,840
Concubine Qiao is quite sensible

337
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
and broad-minded.

338
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
She'll understand.

339
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,680
I hope so.

340
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,760
Madam,

341
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,400
you haven't slept well for days.

342
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,760
Please have some mind-soothing soup.

343
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,680
What does Luo Shiyi think she is?

344
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,720
Why did she get to go to the banquet

345
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,480
with Great Madam?

346
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,920
That privilege should've been mine.

347
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,080
She's just the daughter of a concubine

348
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,560
who's of low status.

349
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,200
No matter how low her status is,

350
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,440
she's now the wife of Marquis Yongping.

351
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,160
Great Madam.

352
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,600
I always thought

353
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,440
that you were
the most understanding one.

354
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
I can't believe you actually

355
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
said such mean things.

356
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,280
I don't even think

357
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,080
I know you anymore.

358
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,520
Great Madam.

359
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,920
I made a mistake.

360
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,320
I said the wrong things

361
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,280
out of anger.

362
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,800
Great Madam, please...

363
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,520
Please forgive me.

364
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
No matter how upset you are,

365
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,440
you should know

366
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,040
the hierarchy.

367
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,760
You should've

368
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,680
understood that the day

369
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
you married into our Xu family.

370
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,920
Great Madam.

371
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
I know

372
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,840
I made a mistake.

373
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,560
In the future,

374
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,440
I'll place myself in the right position.

375
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,880
I won't cause trouble anymore.

376
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,840
Great Madam, don't be mad.

377
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,600
Please forgive me, okay?

378
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,000
You got to remember.

379
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Your job is to take care

380
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,160
of Lingyi.

381
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,920
Do not think about other things anymore.

382
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,000
I will take good care of His Lordship.

383
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,200
I won't let you worry again,

384
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,880
Great Madam.

385
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Great Madam.

386
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,040
I used to think

387
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,880
Lianfang is

388
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,840
a gentle

389
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,160
and sensible girl.

390
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,560
I can't believe...

391
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
Hadn't I

392
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,040
heard it myself today,

393
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,640
I wouldn't have believed

394
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,600
that she also has a side like that?

395
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Great Madam,

396
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,160
don't take it too seriously.

397
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,520
It's quite normal

398
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,960
that Concubine Qiao feels upset.

399
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
She said those things

400
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,440
because

401
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,840
she wanted to vent.

402
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,440
Come to think of it,

403
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,480
Shiyi is actually the one

404
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,560
who's honest,

405
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
kind,

406
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,000
and smart.

407
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,760
I misunderstood her before.

408
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,440
Legitimate or illegitimate,
lowborn or highborn,

409
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,160
after all, one's nature will never change.

410
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,480
How come

411
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,960
Great Madam suddenly came here?

412
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,640
Madam,

413
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
what should we do?

414
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,240
After all the things that happened,

415
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,080
from Zhun's illness,

416
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,800
the moldy rice, to Jie's adoption,

417
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,480
Great Madam doesn't trust me

418
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,360
as much as she did anymore.

419
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,640
And she just heard me say such things.

420
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,200
Who knows how she'll think of me?

421
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,440
If you lose Great Madam's trust,

422
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,640
it'll be even harder

423
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,880
for you in the future.

424
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,680
Madam,

425
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,080
we'd better

426
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,080
keep a low profile from now on.

427
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
You want me to give up?

428
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,800
Then I'll really lose everything.

429
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,120
I can't just take it lying down.

430
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,440
My Lord.

431
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,320
My Lord.

432
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,640
What is it?

433
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
Are you having a nightmare?

434
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
Don't. Run.

435
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,160
Run. Run.

436
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,760
My Lord.

437
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,920
It's okay. It's alright.

438
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,360
You had a nightmare.

439
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,840
It's okay now.

440
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,320
Usually, you are serious and cold.

441
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I didn't expect

442
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,640
that you also have a weak spot.

443
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,160
I was wondering
what you were dreaming about

444
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
that scared you so much.

445
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,080

My Lord,

I was at the bedside.

482
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,200
I...

483
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,600
You don't remember?

484
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,000
Did anything happen?

485
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,520
You want to deny it?

486
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,800
I...

487
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,280
I...

488
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,840
Did I offend you?

489
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,960
-My Lord, I...
-I am just kidding.

490
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,000
Lingyi, I heard

491
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,480
that you were drunk yesterday.

492
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,680
I was quite concerned about you.

493
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,520
I didn't expect

494
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,480
that you'd look so energetic today,

495
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,640
which means

496
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,840
Shiyi took very good care of you.

497
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Seeing that you two

498
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,320
get along so well,

499
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,520
I feel

500
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,240
happy and relieved.

501
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,840
Shiyi is thoughtful and caring.

502
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,880
Mother, you need not to worry.

503
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
These days,

504
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,040
Shiyi has been taking good care

505
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,840
of the household management.

506
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,400
I've noticed it.

507
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,480
Thank you for your hard work.

508
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,360
Mother, you flattered me.

509
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,160
I'm just doing my job
as a daughter-in-law.

510
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,080
Everybody can see

511
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,680
that you are doing a great job.

512
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,440
Shiyi, you don't need to be modest.

513
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,040
By the way,

514
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,640
I really like

515
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,720
the embroidery handkerchief

516
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,360
you made for me.

517
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,080
I've never seen such

518
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,280
exquisite embroidery.

519
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,960
Apparently, you put a lot of effort in it.

520
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,080
I'm glad you like it, Mother.

521
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,400
If you don't mind,

522
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,040
I can make

523
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,480
a dress for you. Is that okay?

524
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Of course.

525
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,960
How could I mind?

526
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
That's great.

527
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,920
Then I'll ask them

528
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,440
to buy some good fabric.

529
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,960
Zhaoying.

530
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,640
My Lord, what do you need?

531
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,480
The window is broken.

532
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,720
Get someone to repair it.

533
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,680
Well...

534
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,080
Which one is broken, My Lord?

535
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,200
I say the window is broken.

536
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,680
My Lord, it's not.

537
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,520
Is it now?

538
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,480
Yes.

539
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,160
Amber,

540
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,200
when do you think I can do

541
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,640
the embroidery as well as Her Ladyship?

542
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,040
That'll never happen.

543
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,520
Is it really that hard?

544
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Put them on the bed.

545
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,840
My Lord, what are you...

546
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,200
The window is broken in Banyuepan.

547
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,920
It needs to be repaired.

548
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,160
I'll stay here for a few days.

549
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,560
It's broken?

550
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,880
How?

551
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,840
-It's...
-Well...

552
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,200
How did it happen?

553
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,040
I broke it by accident.

554
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,920
It's badly broken.

555
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,720
I don't think it can be repaired
in a couple of days.

556
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,120
It'll take at least ten days or so.

557
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,840
Alright. Leave us.

558
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,760
If the window in Banyuepan is broken,

559
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
and you can't sleep there,

560
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,520
there are still many other places
in the mansion

561
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,360
where you can stay.

562
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,190
The Western Lateral Court

563
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,150
is the main court of the mansion.

564
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,190
What's wrong with me

565
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,520
staying here?

566
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,230
Besides,

567
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,800
you are my wife.

568
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,960
This is the place where you live.

569
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,360
So where else could I go?

570
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,150
I'll sleep in the warmth partition.

571
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,230
Don't. Don't.

572
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,080
You take the bed.
I'll sleep in the warmth partition.

573
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,520
I always stay outside for battles,

574
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,920
and I even slept on the ground before.

575
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,710
It's all the same to me.

576
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,920
But you are different.

577
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,190
So you should sleep on the bed.

00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,760
Did I wake you up?

606
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,920
I wasn't asleep either.

607
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Are you

608
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,320
reading The Waterway Classic?

609
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,320
I just read it to kill time.

610
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
I want to read

611
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,960
the fishing songs, folk songs,

612
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,120
and fairy tales in the book,

613
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,480
hoping one day I'll have a chance

614
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,600
to...

615
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,960
To what?

616
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,120
...to take a look at those sceneries.

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
to hold the same thought.

620
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,520
I won't disturb you anymore.

621
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,480
Go to sleep.

622
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,600
Put your hands under the blanket.

623
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,720
Don't.

624
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,760
Don't.

625
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,720
Don't.

Don't.

629
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,560
Run.

630
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,920
Run.

631
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
Run.

632
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,880
General Fu.

633
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,280
I see that you are very good at combat.

634
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,000
When did you start

635
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,200
to learn martial arts?

636
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,800
For His Lordship's health benefits,

637
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,320
the late Marquis started teaching

638
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,320
him martial arts when he was little.

639
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,840
I also lived in the mansion,

640
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,320
so I practiced together with him.

641
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,840
When he was little?

642
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,240
In that case,

643
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,760
you've been with His Lordship
for many years.

644
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,720
You must know His Lordship very well.

645
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,080
My mother passed away early.

646
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,120
I've kept His Lordship company
when I was a child.

647
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,880
Great Madam treated me like her son.

648
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,760
I practiced martial arts

649
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,720
and joined the army with him.

650
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,040
So, I know everything

651
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,520
about His Lordship.

652
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
I found

653
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,520
that His Lordship always has nightmares.

654
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,480
Dreams are reflections of reality.

655
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,880
But His Lordship is
such a strong and tough man.

656
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,560
What bothers him

657
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,920
this much exactly?

658
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
Although it's been years,

659
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,400
His Lordship still can't let go of

660
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,640
a matter that happened in the past.

661
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,960
Happened in the past?

662
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,520
Back then, late Marquis,
and Master Ling'an

663
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,920
fell into the trap set up by Ou family

664
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,000
and got killed on the battleground.

665
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,200
And I also lost my father

666
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,560
at that time.

667
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,720
From then on, I became

668
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,760
His Lordship's Vice General.

669
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,680
We suffered great loss in that battle,

670
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,560
which almost wiped out the entire army.

671
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,680
I guess His Lordship
still can't forget that.

672
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
For all these years,

673
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,800
His Lordship must have gone

674
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,760
through so many brutal battles

675
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,320
for today's

676
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,360
peace and prosperity of Xu family.

677
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,040
After late Marquis passed away,

678
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,600
Ou family set us up

679
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
and almost destroyed Xu family.

680
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,720
Marquis Jingyuan kept pushing us.

681
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,160
So His Lordship took me
to join the army.

682
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,480
He started from an ordinary soldier

683
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
and made his way up step by step.

684
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,840
To make contributions,

685
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,240
His Lordship fought enemies bravely

686
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,480
and gave no thought to his own safety.

687
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,800
One day,

688
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,800
the commander sent us

689
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,040
to secretly attack the enemy's camp.

690
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,000
Young Master,

691
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,080
have you lost your mind?

692
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,520
There are so many enemies,

693
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,560
yet we only have a dozen people.

694
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,760
We are literally looking for death.

695
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Of course I realize that.

696
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,520
But hundreds of lives

697
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,920
of our Xu family

698
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,160
count on me now.

699
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,640
If I don't make this contribution,

700
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,760
our Xu family will never
be able to turn over,

701
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,880
and we can never
take down the Ou family

702
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,480
and avenge my father
and my brother.

703
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,920
I have to take this risk

704
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,520
even if I die.

705
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,920
His Lordship has gone through a lot.

706
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,800
But he always
keeps everything to himself.

707
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,520
Over time,

708
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,320
he's become a little cold

709
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,440
and ruthless.

710
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,320
But I know

711
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,040
that this is his way to protect

712
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,960
Xu family and himself.

713
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,240
So,

714
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,280
that's why His Lordship appears

715
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,720
to be cold and serious.

716
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,480
But he wasn't like that before.

717
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,240
When the late Marquis was still alive,

718
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,160
His Lordship liked laughing

719
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,160
and playing polo.

720
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,000
He was nothing different

721
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,800
from those lively and cheerful

722
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,000
young men in the capital.

723
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,080
A lively and cheerful Marquis?

724
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,960
It's really hard to imagine.

725
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,120
(For all these years,)

726
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,480
(His Lordship has gone through a lot.)

727
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,800
(But he always
keeps everything to himself.)

728
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,760
(Over time,)

729
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,360
(he's armed himself)

730
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,160
(with coldness and ruthlessness.)

731
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,480
My Lord, you are back.

732
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,920
Why are you still up?

733
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,600
I made some soup for you.

734
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,520
It'll warm you up.

735
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,760
My Lord.

736
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,320
I strained my wrist

737
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,560
when I practiced sword today.

738
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,560
It still feels sore.

739
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,400
Shiyi, could you do me a favor?

740
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,520
You are pretending it, aren't you?

741
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,880
It's true.

742
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,080
I'm not lying.

743
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,400
Then I'll go get some medicine.

744
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,640
My Lord, do you want the soup or not?

745
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,680
Let me.
