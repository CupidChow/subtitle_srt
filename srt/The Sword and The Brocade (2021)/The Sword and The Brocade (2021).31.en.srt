19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,080
Putting someone in the dark

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
could work both ways.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
If he can hurt our Xu family,

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,520
he could also hurt the Ou family.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,600
Since we know his existence,

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,400
we can turn the danger
into our opportunity.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
But

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,200
the Ou family
have been plotting it for long

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,960
and they have connections
with the pirates.

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
It won't be easy

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,320
to deal with them.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
To avenge my father and my brother

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,040
and to remove the evil from our society,

32
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,990
I've got to find the evidence suggesting

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,640
that the Ou family
collude with the pirates,

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,280
so as to take them down
once and for all.

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,980
(I also need to find the evidence)

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,240
(suggesting the Ou family
collude with the pirates)

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,520
(and killed my mother)

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,760
(so as to bring the killer to justice.)

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,320
My Lord, this room

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,520
has been empty for too long.

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,640
It's quite dusty.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Please allow Dongqing and me
to clean it up.

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,040
It'll make your stay

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,400
more comfortable.

45
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,040
I won't sleep here tonight.

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,640
Zhaoying.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,960
My Lord, what do you need?

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,920
Take all my stuff

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,120
back to Banyuepan.

50
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
My Lord.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Yes.

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll tell Mother

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,360
that I have too much work to do

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,000
after the disaster relief trip,

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,680
so I have to move back to Banyuepan.

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
You had a long and tiring journey.

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,800
You must be tired.

58
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,160
Go to bed early.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,920
Your Ladyship.

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,520
Amber,

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,640
go and help Zhaoying pack.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,440
Your Ladyship.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,000
Since His Lordship went

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,080
to pick you up in person

65
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,520
and pleaded for mercy for you

66
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,480
in front of Great Madam,

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,560
it means that His Lordship still

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
cares about you.

69
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,160
I understand.

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,080
But

71
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,560
to him,

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,120
my lies and mistrust

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,360
hurt him even deeper than that cut.

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,000
His Lordship is just having

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,560
a hard time to get over it for now.

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Let's give him more time.

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm sure things will get better.

78
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,380
(Rites)

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,080
My Lord,
since you care about Her Ladyship,

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,510
even told a lie

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,070
to protect her,

82
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,480
why can't you forgive her?

83
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,440
I just can't get over the fact

84
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,320
that she has never

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,800
trusted me this whole time.

86
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,360
How much

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,960
do I mean to her?

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,640
Whenever I think about it,

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,760
I don't know how to face her.

90
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Antai,

91
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,480
what's the date today?

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,040
The eighth.

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,040
Why do you ask?

94
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,200
The eighth.

95
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,440
So

96
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
it'll soon be my father's birthday.

97
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,560
Young Master, am I hearing it wrong?

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
You always avoid

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
seeing your father.

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,200
How come you suddenly

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
asked about him?

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,440
Young Master.

103
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,400
Young Master.

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,280
Where are you going?

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
The wharf is this way.

106
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll go and prepare a birthday gift
for my father.

107
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,960
I've heard about Xiaolan

108
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,560
and Lingkuan after I came back.

109
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,840
If you feel upset,

110
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
you can talk to me.

111
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
Don't keep it to yourself.

112
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,440
The moment I married into the Xu family,

113
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,440
I knew

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
one day

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,560
something like this would happen.

116
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
As a noble member of a wealthy family,

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
how can he just
have one woman in his life?

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,160
Lingkuan treats me very well actually.

119
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,440
Since it already happened,

120
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,400
I may as well just

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
make him satisfied.

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
You really think

123
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,360
that's what Lingkuan wants?

124
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,840
If he doesn't,

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,440
why would he do that?

126
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,680
Men are

127
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,240
like children.

128
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,440
If you keep pestering him,

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
he'll get annoyed.

130
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,600
And now

131
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
I made Xiaolan his concubine.

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,240
It'll not only satisfy his needs,

133
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,520
but also make him feel guilty

134
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,600
and appreciate me.

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,440
Besides, no one would criticize me

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,080
for being jealous.

137
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
So it's a win-win.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
Princess, why don't you talk to Lingkuan?

139
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,600
Maybe it'll help you

140
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,960
understand each other more.

141
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Lingkuan already treats me very well.

142
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,960
If I'm too narrow-minded

143
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,320
and petty,

144
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,720
I'll make him disappointed.

145
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,160
Lingkuan.

146
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,600
I thought you weren't

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
coming tonight.

148
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
What's this?

149
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,040
I see that
you don't have appetite lately,

150
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,720
so I bought

151
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,600
your favorite Ma's fish ball.

152
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,640
Lingkuan, you care about me so much.

153
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,640
I was just craving for it,

154
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,040
and you brought me some.

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,640
This store is very popular.

156
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Lingkuan, you must have
waited for a long time.

157
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,040
It's no big deal.

158
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm sorry I made a mistake

159
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,280
and put you through this.

160
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,480
Don't worry.

161
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
In the future,

162
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,720
I promise I will protect

163
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,920
you and our child well.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,760
As long as I have your true love,

165
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
it's enough for me.

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,920
You are my husband.

167
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,280
You don't need
to be sorry about anything.

168
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,160
You are the one

169
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,800
and only in my heart.

170
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
No one can replace you.

171
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,880
Your Ladyship.

172
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,000
Your Ladyship.

173
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
You've cooked for

174
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,880
His Lordship for days,

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,760
but His Lordship hasn't eaten any.

176
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
You can have it.

177
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
Your Ladyship,

178
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,200
Lady Wuniang is here to see you.

179
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,920
Let her in.

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,680
Yes.

181
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,080
Wuniang.

182
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,160
Shiyi.

183
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Here. Have a seat.

184
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,120
I should have visited you earlier.

185
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,800
But I was a little under the weather,

186
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,160
so I couldn't come until today.

187
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,080
The Xu family kept it a secret
from everybody.

188
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,360
I didn't even know

189
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,120
you were sent to the farm

190
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,600
until you came back.

191
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
It's in the past already.

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,280
Wuniang, no need to worry.

193
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,640
Do you feel better now?

194
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
This is why

195
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,000
I come here today.

196
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm pregnant.

197
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
Really?

198
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,320
That's great.

199
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,960
I have two bolts

200
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,800
of top-line fabric.

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I can use it to make some clothes

202
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
for my nephew.

203
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
No rush at all.

204
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,240
It's still early.

205
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
I don't think so.

206
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
It is for my nephew.

207
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,840
I need to make it carefully,

208
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
so I have to start preparing early.

209
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,400
Your husband must be very happy.

210
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,080
He certainly is.

211
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
He cooks

212
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,320
different dishes for me

213
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,640
every day.

214
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,560
Look at me,

215
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
I've put on so much weight.

216
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,800
What's with the meal?

217
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,760
I cooked it for His Lordship.

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
He didn't eat.

219
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,920
So I brought it back.

220
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,600
What happened?

221
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
You two had a fight?

222
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
A couple should always

223
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,520
make up after a fight.

224
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,600
If you have

225
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
a child,

226
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,840
that'll make him happy,

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,320
and he won't be angry with you anymore.

228
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,120
So, you should try

229
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,160
to get pregnant and give birth

230
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,960
to his child as soon as possible.

231
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,440
A child?

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,600
I haven't thought

233
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,200
about giving birth yet.

234
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,520
What's wrong?

235
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,440
Why are you sighing here?

236
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,240
His Lordship and Her Ladyship

237
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
haven't talked to each other for days.

238
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
It really makes me worried.

239
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,520
I know.

240
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
But it's His Lordship's business.

241
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,680
How can we interfere in it?

242
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,160
Let me go to Zhaoying

243
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,240
and ask him.

244
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,240
See if he has any good idea

245
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,120
that can help Her Ladyship.

246
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,600
Then...

247
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,960
Then pick your words carefully.

248
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,120
Don't worry.

249
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,320
I will.

250
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm leaving.

251
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
What's going on with you?

252
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,680
I may have a cold.

253
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,480
My nose has been blocked for days.

254
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,000
And the medicine didn't help either.

255
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,000
It feels terrible.

256
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,040
How's His Lordship's wound?

257
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,760
You know it.

258
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,360
He didn't receive treatment in time

259
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,120
because of the disaster relief,

260
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,240
so he has never completely healed.

261
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,000
When he saved Her Ladyship
in the farm,

262
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,160
his would opened again

263
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,080
making it even worse.

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
And now, he's trying to be tough

265
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,120
and pretending

266
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,200
that he's fine.

267
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I even have to change the dressing
for him in secret.

268
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,840
It hasn't got any better.

269
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,720
His Lordship is doing this

270
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,000
all for Her Ladyship.

271
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
If Great Madam finds out

272
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,040
that His Lordship is injured this badly,

273
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
she'll blame Her Ladyship again.

274
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,640
I just don't understand.

275
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,120
His Lordship cares
so much about Her Ladyship,

276
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,200
but when Her Ladyship brought him meal,

277
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,400
he didn't eat any.

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
Instead, he asked her to take it back.

279
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,920
Let me ask you.

280
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,520
When Her Ladyship left,

281
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,160
how did His Lordship feel?

282
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,040
He felt even worse.

283
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,840
General, you know

284
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,560
how close

285
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
His Lordship and Her Ladyship are.

286
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Yes.

287
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,360
We both know it.

288
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,240
So Her Ladyship should know it better.

289
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
She shouldn't have left.

290
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,560
Even if His Lordship

291
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,360
pulls a long face, so what?

292
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,880
Her Ladyship has done well enough.

293
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,360
What more do you want
Her Ladyship to do?

294
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
You've got to be reasonable.

295
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
You are the unreasonable one.

296
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
Look into my eyes

297
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
and tell me,

298
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,080
how well has Her Ladyship done?

299
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,160
Not enough.

300
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
Are you crazy?

301
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
You... You deserved it.

302
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,960
I...

303
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,920
I won't forgive her.

304
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,560
Come on.

305
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,360
It's not worth it getting mad

306
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,360
at a maid.

307
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,200
Right?

308
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
What maid?

309
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
She's...a tigress.

310
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,800
Over here. Here. Here.

311
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,440
Here. Here.

312
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,000
My nose is better.

313
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
It's unblocked.

314
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,520
Is it because

315
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,440
she bumped it?

316
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,040
Can't believe that it turned

317
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,880
out to be a good thing for you.

318
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,240
Looks like

319
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,320
Dongqing

320
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
is your lucky charm.

321
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,840
What are you talking about?

322
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,040
Zhaoying,

323
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,560
change the dressing for me.

324
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,080
My Lord, your wound is not healed.

325
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,560
Why didn't you tell me?

326
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
Your wound got worse

327
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,520
because of me.

328
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,240
Why did you keep it from me?

329
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
What are you doing here?

330
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,440
Zhaoying.

331
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,480
My Lord, stop calling.

332
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,200
Zhaoying is not there.

333
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
You were injured because of me.

334
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,400
Of course I should take care of you.

335
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,680
You don't have to feel guilty.

336
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
It doesn't matter
who changes the dressing.

337
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,800
Just go back.

338
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,360
You think I'll leave just because

339
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,440
you said a few cold words?

340
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,200
What are you doing?

341
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,560
Take off your clothes

342
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,520
and change the dressing for you.

343
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,920
I've said it.

344
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,080
I don't need you to do it.

345
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,560
What?

346
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Are you shy, My Lord?

347
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,000
I...

348
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,560
How can I be shy for this?

349
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,600
I injured you this badly.

350
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,600
It must be very hurt.

351
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,920
It's not hurt anymore.

352
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
You are lying.

353
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,200
With a wound like this,

354
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,240
how can it not hurt?

355
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,640
I'll get the physician.

356
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,560
I've seen the physician.

357
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,200
I just don't want Mother to know

358
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,920
so I keep it a secret.

359
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,800
I'll change the dressing

360
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,280
for you every day from now on.

361
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I've told you.

362
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't have to.

363
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,800
If you don't let me,

364
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll tell Mother about it.

It's getting late.

399
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
My Lord, go to bed early.

400
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,360
"According to Heaven's will,

401
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,080
His Majesty hereby issued
the following edict:

402
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,680
(Restrain Yourself, Follow Social Norms)
He Zhongxiang, Prefect of Yongding,

403
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,360
and Wei Cheng'en, Prefect of Tai'an,

404
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,960
are found guilty of serious embezzlement

405
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,800
and dereliction of duty
during the disaster relief.

406
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,800
They will be sentenced to death
immediately.

407
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Xu Lingyi, Marquis Yongping,
on behalf of the imperial court,

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,200
made great effort to
alleviate the plight of the refugees,

409
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,800
(Imperial Edict)
which is indeed praiseworthy.

410
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,000
He'll be rewarded with
2000 hectares of good fields

411
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
and 500 tael of silver.

412
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,480
Respect this."

413
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

414
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,980
(Memorial)

415
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,320
My Lord, you've planned for years
in Shandong.

416
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,920
Yet it's all destroyed

417
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,920
by Xu Lingyi.

418
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
It's such a pity.

419
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,400
Father.

420
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,280
Mr. Zhu.

421
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,720
Young Master Lixing.

422
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,040
Father, tomorrow is your birthday.

423
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,520
I asked people

424
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,760
to find a piece of
South Sea coral for you.

425
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,840
May you

426
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,920
stay young

427
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,200
and live a long life.

428
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,120
If you used your thoughts

429
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
on the right things,

430
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,740
(Memorial)

431
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,160
you'd be successful already.

432
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,920
My Lord,

433
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,480
it's a warm gesture

434
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,000
from Young Master Lixing.

435
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,280
Father.

436
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,040
Father.

437
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Mr. Zhu.

438
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,200
Young Master Yanxing.

439
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,920
Lixing.

440
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,120
Yanxing.

441
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
Master Yanxing.

442
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,800
Yanxing.

443
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,560
You are back.

444
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,920
Father misses you a lot.

445
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
He hasn't been well recently.

446
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,280
In the future,

447
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,040
don't make father angry anymore.

448
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,600
Lixing, don't worry.

449
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,960
Tomorrow is father's birthday.

450
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,560
I'm back to celebrate

451
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,600
father's birthday specially.

452
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,040
Yanxing, you didn't

453
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,480
come back last year.

454
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,720
Did you make trouble outside,

455
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,360
so you came back this time?

456
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,120
Lixing, you are right to blame me.

457
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
Last year I couldn't come back
for some business.

458
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,600
This year,

459
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
I don't dare

460
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
to miss father's birthday again.

461
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,400
I appreciate your filial piety.

462
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,600
Father,

463
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,320
this is the birthday gift
I prepared for you.

464
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
Early Spring Painting.

465
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,080
It's so unique.

466
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,440
It's done by a famous painter indeed.

467
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,920
The mountains in the background
represent prosperity.

468
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,840
It's a godsend gift
that'll bring happiness to our family.

469
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,240
You are

470
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,200
the one who understands me the most.

471
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,440
Father, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

472
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,680
But the good story of a happy family

473
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,360
with a strong father and a kind mother

474
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,920
is not heard often.

475
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,080
Not everything

476
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
will go as you expect in life.

477
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,600
Put this painting in my study.

478
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
As long as you are willing to be back,

479
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll double my effort

480
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,840
to make it up to you
for what happened before.

481
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,120
No matter how well you can do business,

482
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
it's after all unpromising.

483
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,360
The court, however,

484
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,240
is the place where you can
fulfill your ambition.

485
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,920
Father, you know

486
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,440
that I'm not
interested in court affairs.

487
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
I've been doing business for years,

488
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,200
so that I can experience more

489
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
when I'm young.

490
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
Hope you can understand me, Father.

491
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,920
It's...

492
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
It's not an urgent matter.

493
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,640
But, it's not proper that you are

494
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,320
out of home all the time.

495
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,560
Father, in that case,

496
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
I'll move back.

497
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,160
Good.

498
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,680
A harmonious family brings wealth.

499
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
You finally thought it through.

500
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,040
Then I'll bother you

501
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,880
to take care of me in the future.

502
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,560
Of course.

503
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,560
Yanxing, just let me know

504
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,080
if you need anything.

505
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,080
Mother.

506
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,040
I'm back.

507
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,900
(Portrait of Ou Yanxing's Mother)

508
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,600
Young Master,

509
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,880
you gave your father a birthday gift,

510
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,120
and now you even moved back.

511
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,040
What's going on?

512
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,520
I really don't get it.

513
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,040
Antai,

514
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,280
do you still remember

515
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,640
the bunch of people in black

516
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,680
who attacked Shiyi
that day in the farm?

517
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,280
The leader is actually

518
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,840
Lixing's personal guard, Lin Shan.

519
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,480
There's a scar on Lin Shan's hand,

520
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,600
which is just like the one
on that assassin's.

521
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,240
I just took another close look.

522
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
It's exactly the same.

523
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,200
You mean

524
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
Master Lixing wants to kill Madam Xu?

525
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,080
So is it also Master Lixing

526
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,440
who killed Madam Xu's mother?

527
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,520
I guess Lixing already knew

528
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,960
that Shiyi came into our house that day.

529
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
He found out from our conversation

530
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,080
that Shiyi was still investigating
her mother's death.

531
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,360
But he didn't say anything.

532
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,560
Instead, he encouraged us

533
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,920
to find that coroner,

534
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
leading Shiyi into suspecting
Marquis Yongping.

535
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,520
In that case,

536
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,360
it's Master Lixing

537
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,900
who bought off
the assistant steward and asked him

538
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,760
to steal that piece of embroidery cloth.

539
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,520
He wanted to stop Madam Xu
from investigating,

540
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,360
that's the reason he wanted her to be dead.

541
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,720
I came back this time

542
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
so that I can
investigate into this thing.

543
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,240
There are quite a few
questionable points.

544
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
Concubine Lv was just
a concubine of the Luo family.

545
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,200
How was she related to our Ou family?

546
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,760
Why would Lixing kill her?

547
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,000
Young Master, you mean...

548
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,760
These years, my father and my brother

549
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
have been acting more suspiciously.

550
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,840
Maybe Concubine Lv was killed

551
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
because she learned something

552
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,920
she shouldn't have.

553
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,800
Father is already
quite disappointed in me.

554
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,560
And now Yanxing is back.

555
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,400
Do we still have a future?

556
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,280
You don't need to sell yourself short.

557
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,000
No matter how much father favors him,

558
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,000
he's after all

559
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,720
just a businessman who's never

560
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,080
made any contribution.

561
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,560
How can he compare to you?

562
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,280
Don't forget

563
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,440
that my father is
the Minister of Ministry of War,

564
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,640
which is the root of our Ou family.

565
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,000
Yet he put me in the Ministry of Rites.

566
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,520
I'm afraid that my father

567
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
intends to promote him
instead of me.

568
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,400
But he's never made any contribution.

569
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,760
No matter how much father likes him,

570
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,480
he has to make a fair decision.

571
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,720
As long as father wants to,

572
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,720
there are so many pirates.

573
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,960
It's not hard for father

574
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
to fake some military exploits for him.

575
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,720
In my opinion,

576
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,440
no matter how much he's favored,

577
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,400
he's just an illegitimate son.

578
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,200
The only reason that he's posed

579
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,440
a threat to you

580
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,640
is because

581
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,240
you've failed too many times

582
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,000
and father has lost his trust in you.

583
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,240
If you can regain

584
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,040
father's trust,

585
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,960
he will not bypass you to promote him,
an illegitimate son.

586
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,480
Be that as it may,

587
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
it's not an easy thing

588
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,840
to regain father's trust.

589
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,020
I have an idea.

590
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
(Tianxiang House)
Welcome, Sir.

591
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,720
Hold on.

592
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,520
Isn't it Duke Mao's son?

593
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
I heard that you were quite lucky.

594
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,000
You almost

595
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,120
became a close guest of Lady Liansong.

596
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,520
How dare you bother me?

597
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,720
You only have the guts

598
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,040
to bully us.

599
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,920
If you met Duke Wei,

600
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,960
I'm afraid

601
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,280
you'd already

602
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,960
kneel down and beg for forgiveness.

603
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,320
Ren Kun is nothing to me.

604
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
I'll kill him sooner or later.

605
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,460
Be off.

606
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:56,420
(Duke Wei's Mansion)

607
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,440
Ren Kun.

608
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,480
Get out.

609
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,720
Get out and see me.

610
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Ren Kun.

611
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,060
(Duke Wei's Mansion)

612
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,680
Get out.

613
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,680
Who is it?

614
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,160
How dare you make trouble
in our Ren family?

615
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,680
Where's Ren Kun? I want to see him.

616
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,320
I didn't know it was you,

617
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,520
Sir.

618
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,240
It'll be curfew soon.

619
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
You'd better go back.

620
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,400
Even...

621
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,560
Even you dare look down upon me?

622
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,080
I'll kill you.

623
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,400
Murderer. Duke Wei is going to kill me.

624
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,160
Look. Duke Wei is going to kill me.

625
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,140
(Duke Wei's Mansion)

626
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,980
What happened?

627
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,920
Duke Wei is going to kill me.

628
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,640
Who is making noise outside?

629
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,200
My Lord.

630
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,960
Don't know.

631
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
It's you again.

632
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,880
Don't... Don't kill me.

633
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,400
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

634
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,640
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

635
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,060
(Duke Wei's Mansion)

636
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,360
Someone's dead. Someone's dead.

637
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,120
Someone's dead. Someone's dead.

638
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,420
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

639
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,720
Madam. Bad news.

640
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,680
Young Master...

641
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,480
Young Master is dead.

642
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,920
What are you talking about?

643
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,520
Yu'er is fine and well.

644
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,880
How could he die?

645
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
It's true, Madam.

646
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
We just got the message.

647
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,240
Young Master made trouble

648
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,600
outside of the Ren family last night.

649
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,120
He had an argument with Duke Wei.

650
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,200
The servant of the Ren family

651
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,480
hit his head and made him bleed.

652
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,120
Although he left,

653
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,720
he was found dead

654
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,440
in the neighborhood of the Ren family.

655
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
You mean

656
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,080
Duke Wei killed my husband?

657
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,320
Young Master's body

658
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,640
has been sent to the Censorate.

659
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,240
His Lordship rushed over there

660
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
right after he got the news.

661
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,800
Yu'er.

662
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,560
Madam.

663
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,440
Madam.

664
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,200
Madam.

665
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,520
-Madam.
-Madam.

666
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,040
-Madam.
-Madam.

667
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,300
(Precious Breezes and Dew of the Moon)

668
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
My husband is dead.

669
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,560
What am I gonna do?

670
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,640
What?

671
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,040
You feel sad that I'm gone?

672
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,720
Since you miss me this much,

673
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,440
why don't you
go to hell together with me?

674
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,320
Let's get reunited there

675
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,160
and become a loving couple again
in the afterlife.

676
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,080
It hurts.

677
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,320
Help. Help.

678
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,000
I need help.

679
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,480
Beautiful.

680
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,160
Pretty flowers and blooms
are everywhere.

681
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,560
How stunning.

682
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,360
You've only been here

683
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,120
looking after the garden for a month.

684
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Can't believe you've made

685
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,600
this place a paradise of flowers.

686
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,800
I'm just doing my job.

687
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,720
Great Madam,

688
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,880
she is so good at gardening.

689
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,440
She's much better than

690
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
those gardeners at home.

691
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,150
Why don't we fire

692
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,230
those gardeners

693
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,840
and let her
to look after the flowers?

694
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,760
There are too many plants.

695
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,150
I don't think Shiliu

696
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,190
has enough time to do it.

697
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,630
The gardeners do it to make a living.

698
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,150
Shiliu does it for her interest.

699
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,760
It's not the same thing.

700
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,840
Because of her interest,

701
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,280
she spends time

702
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,120
studying gardening.

703
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,400
That's why she can grow

704
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,710
these breathtaking,

705
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,960
beautiful flowers.

706
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,920
What Shiyi said makes sense.

707
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Mother,

708
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,230
it's such a lovely season.

709
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,560
Why don't we invite
the Madams of the noble families over

710
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,960
and hold a flower-admiring feast?

711
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,800
It'll create a lively atmosphere
to our family.

712
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,320
Good idea.

713
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,440
It's been quiet

714
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,520
and cheerless in our family.

715
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,360
It's time for us to have some fun.

716
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
Shiyi,

717
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,760
you are the matron of the house.

718
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,920
I'll let you take care of it.

719
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,720
Yes, Mother.

720
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,020
(Three Variations of the Plum Blossom)

721
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,020
(Three Variations of the Plum Blossom
Correct Tunes of Great Antiquity)

722
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,200
Zhaoying.

723
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,920
Your Ladyship, what do you need?

724
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
Why are there

725
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,480
so many music scores?

726
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,320
They all belong to His Lordship.

727
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,560
His Lordship?

728
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,320
His Lordship plays the zither?

729
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,600
Then how come I've never seen him

730
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,520
play it?

731
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,920
Your Ladyship, with all due respect,

732
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,520
if you are curious,

733
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
why don't you ask His Lordship directly?

734
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,280
If it's not convenient for you to tell,

735
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
just consider that I've never asked.

736
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,920
I just care about His Lordship.

737
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,680
Your Ladyship, you may not know.

738
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,560
His Lordship excelled in
playing the zither when he was young.

739
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,880
He was known as the best in the capital.

740
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,520
Even His Majesty was impressed.

741
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,640
Since His Lordship
loved playing the zither so much,

742
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,240
why do these music scores

743
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,880
look like they haven't

744
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,120
been touched for a long time?

745
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,880
After late Marquis

746
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,600
and Master Ling'an died,

747
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,440
His Lordship blamed himself
for indulging in playing the zither

748
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,280
and never sharing the burden.

749
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,640
So he smashed

750
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,400
his favorite peptachord

751
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,760
in front of their memorial tablets

752
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,120
and vowed to reestablish our Xu family.

753
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,040
He'll never touch zither again

754
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,000
until he takes revenge
for his father and brother.

755
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,380
(Zither Scores)

756
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,600
(I'm afraid no one)

757
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,080
(understands the loneliness
and solitude)

758
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,380
(he has gone through)

759
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,720
(over these years.)

760
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,180
(White Snow in the Spring Sunlight)

761
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,560
During the flower-admiring feast,

762
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,720
let's play
White Snow in the Spring Sunlight

763
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,600
and Three Variations of the Plum Blossom
as background music.

764
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,200
The melodies should be played
softly and gently

765
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,800
to create a pleasant atmosphere
for our guests.

766
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,160
And take out

767
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,720
the Silver Needle tea we have.

768
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,720
This tea tastes fresh and floral;

769
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,160
it's perfect for flower-admiring.

770
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Remember,

771
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,640
the perfume must be carefully chosen.

772
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,640
Let's use

773
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,760
the refreshed dipterocarpaceae.

774
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Your Ladyship, you are so thoughtful.

775
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,480
It's indeed admirable.

776
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,400
Mother is finally
in the mood to have some fun.

777
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,120
Of course we should prepare carefully

778
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,000
and make everything
as perfect as possible.

779
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,600
Your Ladyship.

780
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,640
-What's wrong?
-Bad news.

781
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,720
A message was sent,

782
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
saying that
the heir of Duke Mao was killed.

783
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,240
Lady Erniang had a miscarriage

784
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,040
out of grief.

785
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,960
Marquis, easy.

786
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
My Lord, does your wound hurt again?

787
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,880
We need to go back
and change the dressing.

788
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,360
I'm fine.

789
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,240
Your Ladyship, why don't you go in?

790
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,800
His Lordship

791
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,840
is still bothered by what I did.

792
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
If I seek help from him now...

793
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,360
I...

794
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
Your Ladyship,
do you feel awkward to say it?

795
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,840
Is His Lordship inside?

796
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,120
Let's go.

797
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,040
Your Ladyship,

798
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,200
then do we still need to ask for

799
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,800
His Lordship's help in terms of
what happened to Wang family?

800
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,240
Your Ladyship,

801
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,040
His Lordship is here.

802
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
He's waiting for you inside.

803
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,640
This is the first time His Lordship

804
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,360
has come visit

805
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,640
since Her Ladyship
got back from the farm.

806
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,280
That's right.

807
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,400
Your Ladyship, go ahead and get in.

808
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,760
Don't let His Lordship wait too long.

809
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,960
My Lord.

810
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,960
I heard that Wang Yu was killed.

811
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,920
I know you must be concerned,

812
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,160
so I had my people
to find some information.

813
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,800
My Lord, you tried to find

814
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,400
some information specially for me?

815
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,920
Wang Yu was killed,

816
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,200
and Erniang had a miscarriage.

817
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,720
The Wang family is in a mess

818
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,080
after the two accidents.

819
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,160
The court officials

820
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,920
have also been talking about it.

821
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,320
What happened exactly?

822
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,800
How come Wang Yu

823
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,520
was suddenly killed?

824
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,840
Has the murderer been found?

825
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,320
It's said that Wang Yu

826
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,520
was accidentally hit by the concierge

827
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,840
of Duke Wei's Mansion,

828
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,320
and then died from severe injury.

829
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,000
Duke Wei?

830
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,840
But Duke Mao thought

831
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,720
that Duke Wei asked the concierge

832
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,600
to kill Wang Yu as an act of revenge.

833
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,040
Therefore,

834
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,040
Duke Mao even went

835
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,120
to the Censorate in person,

836
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,280
asked them to arrest Duke Wei

837
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,480
and investigate this case strictly.

838
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,360
But due to lack of evidence,

839
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,640
the Censorate wouldn't

840
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,080
offend Duke Wei for no reason.

841
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,920
So they said a few words of comfort

842
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,200
and sent Duke Mao back.

843
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,880
Duke Mao isn't a well person.

844
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,920
He fell ill out of anger

845
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,400
right after he went back home.

846
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,040
Then, My Lord, do you think

847
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,880
Wang Yu was killed by Duke Wei?

848
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,520
Although Duke Wei had a misunderstanding

849
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,520
with Wang Yu,

850
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,400
it wasn't so serious

851
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,760
that he had to kill him.

852
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,600
Last time when Wang Yu made trouble,

853
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,800
he was almost killed by Duke Wei.

854
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,240
But he started to behave himself

855
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,720
after I warned him.

856
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,480
He had no reason

857
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,720
to mess with Duke Wei again.

858
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,880
This thing is quite strange.

859
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,680
I'm just worried about Erniang.

860
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,120
She has lost her husband

861
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
and her child.

862
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,040
Don't know if she can take it.

863
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,560
I've asked

864
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,120
Imperial Censor Li

865
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,640
to find out the truth

866
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,840
as soon as possible.

867
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,360
And I've sent a message
to the Luo family.

868
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,560
The Wang family will have
a funeral service in a few days.

869
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,680
You can go

870
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,040
and console Erniang then.

871
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,720
I didn't expect that you've

872
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,560
arranged everything
in such a short time.

873
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,640
I feel much more relieved now.

874
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,240
That's good to know.

875
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,600
It's late. Try to sleep early.

876
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,160
My Lord.

877
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,000
Thank you for doing this for me.

878
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,560
Never mind.

879
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,340
(Honor the Ancestors
and Benefit the Offspring)

880
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,080
I heard

881
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,680
that Erniang had a miscarriage.

882
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,480
I was quite worried

883
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,400
so I came here to check on her.

884
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,760
I didn't know

885
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,320
that even Madam Wang fell ill, too.

886
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,520
Thank you, Young Madam Ou,
for your care.

887
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,040
If Ren Kun

888
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,320
hadn't deliberately killed Yu'er,

889
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,120
our Wang family

890
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,280
wouldn't have become like this.

891
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,480
And the Censorate
is the most hateful one.

892
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,360
They bullied the weak
and feared the strong.

893
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,280
They wanted to close the case
after catching only a servant,

894
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,400
and they'd let the real murderer
Ren Kun off.

895
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,360
It's all because they think my father

896
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,520
has no real power

897
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,640
and influence in the court.

898
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,240
Young Madam Jiang,

899
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,720
if you want someone

900
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
influential to help you,

901
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,240
why don't you go and ask
Marquis Yongping?

902
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,360
Mr. Wang and him were in-laws.

903
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,280
And His Majesty values him a lot.

904
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,440
If he can speak for Mr. Wang

905
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,120
in the court,

906
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,720
the Censorate will definitely

907
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,880
take this case seriously.

908
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,200
Marquis Yongping?

909
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,640
Adoption?

910
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,640
Father has asked for
His Majesty's grant.

911
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,480
Looks like this

912
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,040
adoption thing has settled.

913
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,240
Under whose name then?

914
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,840
Under father's name

915
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,080
or my late husband's name?

916
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,040
Father and mother haven't decided yet.

917
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,440
Erniang, as you know,

918
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,720
if a child of our clan

919
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,800
is adopted by father,

920
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,760
then he'll replace

921
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,560
my brother's position
as the only legitimate son.

922
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,280
Then your life

923
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,360
in the Wang family

924
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,800
will be even...

925
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,120
Sister.

926
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,840
I have no one to rely on now.

927
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,120
For the sake that I've

928
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,560
been behaving myself

929
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,240
and taking good care

930
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,880
of my husband and our parents

931
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,160
since I married into the Wang family,

932
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
please help me.

933
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,720
Unless

934
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,040
you can do something for our family

935
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,600
so that father will
have to listen to you.

936
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,640
That murderer Ren Kun

937
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,520
is still at large

938
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,200
for his high-ranking position.

939
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,920
As long as you can have him arrested,

940
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,360
our parents will be grateful for you

941
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,720
and make you an adoptive mother.

942
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,720
Once the child
becomes the successor of the Duke,

943
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,720
you will be Duke Mao's mother,

944
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,280
and no one would dare
to look down upon you anymore.

945
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,600
But

946
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,640
even father isn't able to do that.

947
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,680
I'm just a woman.

948
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,520
What can I do?

949
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,880
You may not be able to do it,

950
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,920
but your brother-in-law,
Marquis Yongping,

951
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,080
surely can.

952
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,080
Marquis Yongping has made
many military exploits.

953
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,720
His Majesty trusts him a lot.

954
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,720
If he can bring it up

955
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,080
in the court,

956
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,600
His Majesty will definitely
issue an edict

957
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
to investigate this case,

958
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,200
and the Censorate will no longer

959
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,640
dare to ignore it.

960
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,440
At this point,

961
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,480
only Marquis Yongping

962
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,240
can help us

963
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,960
avenge Wang Yu and help you

964
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,440
with your future life.

965
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,820
(Honor the Ancestors
and Benefit the Offspring)

966
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:22,960
Erniang,

967
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,840
you've got to listen to me.

968
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,600
As long as you are alive,

969
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,640
there's always hope.

970
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,080
I have no one to rely on now.

971
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,560
Even my family is trying

972
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,720
to set me up.

973
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,440
You are the only one

974
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,800
who really cares about me.

975
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,960
Actually, I've heard

976
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,600
a little about your family.

977
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,760
You are worried about the child,
aren't you?

978
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,040
They want me to ask Marquis Yongping

979
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,960
to go to His Majesty
for the case investigation.

980
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,800
If I can do this,

981
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,800
they'll let me

982
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,240
adopt the kid.

983
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,440
Otherwise,

984
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,760
the kid will be adopted

985
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,120
by my father-in-law.

986
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,400
If that's the case,

987
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,160
I'll become

988
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,560
a helpless widow

989
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,520
in the Wang family.

990
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,920
I do understand their urge

991
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,840
of avenging

992
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,360
their son.

993
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,560
To be honest,

994
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,840
I don't get along with Shiyi.

995
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,720
And I've never had any connection
with the Xu family.

996
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,320
It's really difficult for me

997
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,800
to ask them for help.

998
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,360
Marquis Yongping and Shiyi

999
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,360
are an inseparable

1000
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,760
and loving couple.

1001
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
If she is willing

1002
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,400
to speak for you

1003
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,800
in front of Marquis Yongping,

1004
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,760
he'll certainly listen to her.

1005
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,640
No matter what,

1006
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,920
you two are sisters,

1007
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,120
right?

1008
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,600
She's having such a good

1009
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,440
and happy life.

1010
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,280
How can she just

1011
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,800
sit back and watch

1012
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,200
her sister suffering

1013
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,840
in this difficult situation?

1014
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,720
She knows

1015
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,520
how she got to

1016
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,800
where she is today.

1017
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,280
You are right.

1018
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,960
Now that I'm in trouble,

1019
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,240
she's got to help me.

1020
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,520
I just remembered something.

1021
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,640
You are not well.

1022
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,160
I may as well keep it from you.

1023
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,640
Please just tell me.

1024
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,360
A few days ago, my husband told me

1025
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,240
that Marquis Yongping has been trying

1026
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,200
to rope in Duke Wei
for some court matters.

1027
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,200
If that's the truth,

1028
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,200
I'm afraid he won't be willing

1029
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,320
to offend Duke Wei so easily.

1030
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,400
In that case, would Shiyi

1031
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,280
still speak for you since

1032
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,080
she may be scolded by her husband?

1033
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,680
It's all because of her that

1034
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,360
I ended up like this.

1035
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,440
She owes me.

1036
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,560
I won't forgive her

1037
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,000
if she doesn't help me.

1038
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,640
Shiyi,

1039
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,000
you are the only one
who can help me now.

1040
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,840
Please talk to the Marquis

1041
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,920
and ask him to report this
to His Majesty.

1042
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,200
Shiyi,

1043
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm begging you.

1044
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,400
Only the Marquis Yongping can help us

1045
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,880
to avenge my late husband.

1046
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,520
Erniang, I'm listening.

1047
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,880
Don't be like this.

1048
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,760
It's not that I don't wanna help.

1049
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,880
But it's the Censorate's duty

1050
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,480
to investigate the case.

1051
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,120
It's not His Lordship's place
to interfere.

1052
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,360
But,

1053
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,320
His Lordship has asked

1054
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,440
his friend in the Censorate

1055
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,760
to find out what happened.

1056
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,040
We'd better

1057
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,720
be patient and wait for the result.

1058
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,960
But if we don't report this
to His Majesty

1059
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,400
to raise his attention,

1060
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,120
the Censorate

1061
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,680
will not at all investigate it
impartially.

1062
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,560
But we don't have

1063
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,920
any evidence suggesting

1064
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,880
that Duke Wei is the murderer.

1065
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,240
How can His Lordship report this rashly?

1066
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,280
Do you know

1067
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,280
what kind of situation I'm in right now?

1068
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,160
If I can't avenge

1069
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,600
my late husband,

1070
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,040
my father-in-law

1071
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,520
will adopt a child

1072
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,600
and make him his successor.

1073
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,360
In that case,

1074
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,600
I'll lose everything.

1075
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,480
Shiyi,

1076
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,320
don't forget

1077
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,640
that I married into the Wang family

1078
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,200
and had to suffer all this

1079
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,280
because of you.

1080
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,200
You owe me.

1081
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,840
Erniang,

1082
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,640
I've said many times.

1083
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,200
I don't owe you anything.

1084
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,040
You are my sister.

1085
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,840
I will do my best

1086
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,400
to help you.

1087
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,680
But I can't

1088
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,720
and I won't

1089
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,440
tell His Lordship what to do.

1090
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,400
You said before that

1091
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,240
I can ask you if I need help.

1092
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,640
And now when I really need your help,

1093
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,320
you actually refused to offer any.

1094
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,320
You already knew that it's

1095
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,960
Ren Kun who killed Wang Yu.

1096
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,920
But for the sake of the Xu's interests,

1097
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,520
you dare not offend Ren Kun.

1098
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,400
That's why you

1099
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,560
turn a blind eye to his death.

1100
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,320
Right?

1101
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,200
Erniang,

1102
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,360
I totally understand

1103
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,560
your feelings.

1104
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,840
But,

1105
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,080
even so,

1106
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,120
you shouldn't say those things

1107
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,320
to defame the Xu family.

1108
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,760
Defame the Xu family?

1109
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,160
Xu family

1110
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,280
doesn't wanna help,

1111
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,120
which means you feel guilty.

1112
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,840
If you don't help me,

1113
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,680
then let's

1114
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,760
wait and see.

1115
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,060
(Honor the Ancestors
and Benefit the Offspring)

1116
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,080
Madam Xu.

1117
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,880
Madam Xu.

1118
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,800
Mr. Ou.

1119
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,480
You

1120
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,320
are also here to mourn Mr. Wang?

1121
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,080
Now that I've returned to the Ou family,

1122
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,880
I also help to deal with

1123
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,960
the household matters once in a while.

1124
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,200
In that case,

1125
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,560
I'll leave you be.

1126
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,080
Wait.

1127
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,880
There's something I need you to know.

1128
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,000
Wang Yu's death

1129
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,960
isn't as simple as it appears to be.

1130
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:18,760
Besides,

1131
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,800
although I'm back to the Ou family,

1132
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,560
I won't interfere in the grudge

1133
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,440
between the Xu family and the Ou family,

1134
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,560
and I won't do anything
to harm your family.

1135
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,960
Madam Xu, do you trust me?

1136
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,280
Mr. Ou,

1137
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,560
you don't need to tell me

1138
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,600
what you are going to do.

1139
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,280
And I know very well

1140
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,240
what kind of person you are.

1141
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:38,840
