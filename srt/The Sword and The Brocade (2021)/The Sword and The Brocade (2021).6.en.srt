Amber.

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,320
My Lady, where are you going?

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,880
You've noticed me since earlier, right?

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,440
Her Ladyship told you to watch me?

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,920
Her Ladyship

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,160
is just worried about your safety.

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,800
Amber.

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,760
Thank you

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,440
for asking Teacher Jian
to visit me before.

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,360
And thank you

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,960
for being concerned about me.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,040
Earlier,

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
if you really wanted to stop me,

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
you wouldn't quietly

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,920
follow me here.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I thought you would

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,600
be guarded against me like Dongqing.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
I can understand why you're following

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,680
Her Ladyship's orders.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
I just wanted to express

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,600
my gratitude.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,720
But Amber,

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,440
I must go out today.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,040
I know your difficulties.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,600
I've also lost

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
the closest person to me
whom I depended on.

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
It's just that

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
I really

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,199
can't hide it from Her Ladyship.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,600
The only thing I can do

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,600
is to inform her about this matter

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
one hour from now.

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,640
Amber, thank you.

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,760
I'll surely come back quickly.

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,920
I won't cause you any troubles.

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
(Shuntian Prefecture Office)
Get out.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Sir.

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Don't cause more trouble.

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,520
Leave.

58
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Sir.

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Is Shuntian Prefecture Office

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,120
a place you can just barge into?

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,800
Leave quickly.

62
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,840
Sir, please investigate clearly.

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,560
Lv Qingtong's case is more than
it appears to be.

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,680
The killer is someone else.

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
I have the proof here.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,320
Please let me go inside
to voice my grievance.

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,200
With just this lousy cloth,

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,040
you want the official

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,000
to re-investigate the case?

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,240
This is utterly ridiculous.

71
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,200
Leave.

72
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,400
Otherwise, we'll put you in prison.

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,560
Sir.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,880
Go.

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,680
(I have the evidence in my hand.)

76
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,280
(If I can find a witness,)

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,879
(perhaps the Shuntian Prefecture Office)

78
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120
(can re-investigate mother's case.)

79
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,360
After lighting an incense inside,

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,720
I feel much better.

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,880
Do what you want

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
to do.

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,400
All right.

84
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:56,966
(Ci'an Temple)

85
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm not aware

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,280
of the murder case you've mentioned.

87
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,280
But based on what I know,

88
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,800
on the day of the murder,

89
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,320
aside from Marquis Yongping

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
and his family,

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
we didn't entertain other guests.

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,240
Excuse me.

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
I want to ask you about something.

94
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,160
Do you want to ask

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,720
about the murder case
of the Luo family's female member?

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Just now, I heard

97
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,480
that you asked my senior
about this matter.

98
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
Do you know something?

99
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
To be honest with you,

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,880
the deceased was my mother.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,680
I want to know

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
who killed my mother.

103
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,720
I don't know

104
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
who killed

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,360
your mother.

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,960
I just

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
happened to be

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
at the Octagonal Pavilion
searching for herbs that day.

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720
I saw your mother

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
at the Octagonal Pavilion.

111
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,200
What else did you see?

112
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,240
Nothing else?

113
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
Think about it carefully.

114
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,120
Or maybe

115
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
you saw something

116
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
out of the ordinary?

117
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,400
I remember it now.

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,280
When I was coming back here,

119
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,040
I think I saw another woman

120
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,840
at the Octagonal Pavilion.

121
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,840
A woman?

122
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,880
Who?

123
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,440
I didn't see
what she looked like clearly.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
I only saw her back view.

125
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,040
She must be a female member
of Marquis Yongping's family.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,400
How can you be sure

127
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,000
that she's a female member
of Marquis Yongping's family?

128
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,760
Because that day,
our temple only entertained

129
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,200
female members of the Xu family.

130
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,080
That's why I'm sure.

131
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,920
Did you see

132
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,240
what she was wearing clearly?

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
Is there anything special about her?

134
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
Since it was very far away,

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
I didn't see clearly.

136
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,440
Qingming.

137
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,400
It's time to recite the sutras.

138
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,280
Let's go.

139
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,360
Ma'am, I'll go ahead.

140
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,720
Thank you.

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,320
Let's go.

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,760
Search carefully.

143
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,440
Marquis Yongping's Mansion?

144
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,640
Lady Shiyi is over there.

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Hurry, take her back.

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,280
Don't touch me!

147
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
I can walk by myself.

148
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,480
What's the matter, Qingming?

149
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,400
I suddenly remembered something

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,760
that I forget to tell that woman.

151
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Come on, it's time.

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,120
Let's go.

153
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,840
My Lady.

154
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Your Ladyship.

155
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
We found her in Ci'an Temple.

156
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
Dongqing.

157
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
You didn't serve Shiyi well.

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,760
You were negligent.

159
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Come.

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
Call the slave trader.

161
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,600
Mother.

162
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,840
It's all my fault.

163
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200
Dongqing is not aware of this.

164
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,840
It's all your fault?

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,320
Tell me.

166
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,560
You knowingly committed an offense.

167
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,960
Why exactly did you do that?

168
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,440
(If Her Ladyship finds out that the Xu family)

169
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,720
(is involved in the case,)

170
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
(she'll surely stop me.)

171
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,200
Mother, please investigate clearly.

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
I've thought about it,

173
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,600
and I think that you're right.

174
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,160
In order to let go of my pain

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,480
and start anew,

176
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
I sneaked out

177
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,480
to go to Ci'an Temple to pay respect
to Concubine Lv.

178
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,560
From now on, I'll surely behave.

179
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,560
I won't let you worry about me anymore.

180
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
Are you speaking the truth?

181
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
Mother, you're very discerning.

182
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,080
I definitely don't dare to lie to you.

183
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm also doing this for your sake.

184
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,400
I've been working so hard in my life

185
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,480
to find you

186
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
a good marriage.

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
I don't need your gratitude.

188
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,600
I just hope that you won't waste

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,720
my efforts.

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,200
I'm deeply grateful
for your favor, Mother.

191
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,960
I'll surely won't disappoint you.

192
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
I've already asked them to make

193
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,040
the best coffin for Concubine Lv.

194
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
I'll also give her

195
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,800
a nice burial.

196
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
Consider it

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,440
my way of consoling her soul.

198
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,280
You're spending so much effort.

199
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm forever indebted to you.

200
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,080
Why are you being so shy with me?

201
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,040
All right.

202
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm tired.

203
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,840
Remember.

204
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,200
Take good care of Shiyi.

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,600
If this happens again,

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
I surely won't spare you.

207
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,360
-Yes, Your Ladyship.
-Yes, Your Ladyship.

208
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,640
Stand up.

209
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,800
My Lady, are you all right?

210
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm fine.

211
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,840
I almost dragged you two down.

212
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,880
Her Ladyship won't give her a hard time.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,040
My Lady, you're unaware.

214
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,080
Amber was the one who told on you.

215
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,560
Without Amber,

216
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
I wouldn't have been able to go out.

217
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,200
She goes whichever the wind blows.

218
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
That's the most untrustworthy kind.

219
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,280
I just did

220
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,480
what I have to do.

221
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,320
You don't need to worry about it.

222
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,680
I still have things to do.

223
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,840
I'll go ahead.

224
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Stop giving Amber a hard time.

225
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,680
She has her difficulties too.

226
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
But she's on Her Ladyship's side.

227
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,879
She's not trustworthy.

228
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,040
Let's not talk about her, My Lady.

229
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,160
Did you find anything

230
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,240
when you went out?

231
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,800
Your Ladyship.

232
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,800
Your plan worked indeed.

233
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,280
Lady Shiyi

234
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,640
made such a fuss before.

235
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,560
Now,

236
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,640
she's obeying

237
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,880
your instructions.

238
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,080
Psychological warfare
is the best military tactic.

239
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,120
It's actually the same with people.

240
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,880
Just break her will,

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,520
get a hold of her weakness,

242
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,040
and be both nice and strict.

243
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,560
No matter what she does,

244
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
she won't be able to get away
from my clutches.

245
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Concubine's death

246
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
had something to do with the Xu family?

247
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,880
It seems like we need to find a way

248
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,240
to get close to the Xu family.

249
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,400
But Her Ladyship wants you to marry

250
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,520
into the Wang family.

251
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
Wang Yu is wild and reckless.

252
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,000
You can't marry him.

253
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,160
And after you marry
into the Wang family,

254
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,960
it will be hard for us

255
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,200
to get close to the Xu family.

256
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,680
What should we do then?

257
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,880
My Lord.

258
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,840
I personally

259
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,320
made this perfume satchel for you.

260
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,960
I hope that it can ward off evil
and disasters for you.

261
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,680
You're not feeling well.

262
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,120
Just let the servants do
this kind of thing.

263
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,680
It's a tradition
during the Dragon Boat Festival

264
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,120
for a wife to make an evil-warding
perfume satchel for her husband.

265
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,240
As long as I can still move,

266
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,680
I can't let others do it for me.

267
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,920
Here, I'll put it on you.

268
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
My Lord.

269
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,520
How's Zhun's marriage arrangement
to the Jiang family

270
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,280
coming along?

271
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,640
I've already asked the matchmaker
to propose marriage to the Jiang family.

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,720
Since you're handling this matter,

273
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
it will surely be accomplished.

274
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,560
I'll wait for your good news.

275
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,160
All right.

276
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,040
Rest well.

277
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
I'll go and visit father-in-law.

278
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,360
Yi'er.

279
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,520
Greetings, Mother.

280
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,720
There's no need for courtesy.

281
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Yi'er.

282
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,280
You should visit the Luo family.

283
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
How is the preparation

284
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,280
for the Dragon Boat Festival
gifts going?

285
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,520
They're ready.

286
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
Sit down.

287
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,160
Your father-in-law is mourning at home.

288
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,040
This time,

289
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,320
he'll surely ask you about that matter.

290
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
How do you plan to deal with it?

291
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,920
Back then,

292
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,400
only the Luo family

293
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,880
gave us a helping hand

294
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,200
and even let their eldest
legitimate daughter marry me.

295
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
No matter how you look at it,

296
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
it makes sense for me to go

297
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,320
and help my father-in-law get a job.

298
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,640
But it's not that simple.

299
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm afraid

300
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,160
it won't go as he wishes.

301
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,400
What's the problem?

302
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
His Majesty approved
Grand Secretary Chen's proposal

303
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,360
to implement new tea duties.

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,720
Father-in-law's teacher
Grand Secretary Liu

305
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,520
has always been against this matter.

306
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,160
Now, Grand Secretary Liu has retired.

307
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,640
It will be hard to get my father-in-law

308
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,680
reinstated.

309
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,080
That will be difficult.

310
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,120
Have you told Yuanniang

311
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,400
about this?

312
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,400
She'll just think

313
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,520
that I'm giving excuses.

314
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,640
Yi'er.

315
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,400
You're afraid

316
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,720
that she'll argue with you again, right?

317
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,240
Yuanniang

318
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,920
is too stubborn.

319
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
(Residence of Luo)

320
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,400
Father-in-law, mother-in-law.

321
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,320
Happy Dragon Boat Festival.

322
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,720
My Lord.

323
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,600
Zhenxing.

324
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,680
Lingyi.

325
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,720
Please have a seat.

326
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,800
Yuanniang isn't feeling well,

327
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,360
so Lingyi had to personally
come here.

328
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,160
It's what I should do.

329
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,240
Don't worry about it, Father-in-law.

330
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,240
How is Yuanniang today?

331
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,640
Yuanniang

332
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,880
is feeling much better than before.

333
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,800
That's good.

334
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,400
After your clarification,

335
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,120
I understand

336
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,360
the situation now.

337
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,680
Father-in-law, don't be anxious.

338
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,240
When the timing is right,

339
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll mention it to His Majesty again.

340
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,520
For my affairs,

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,800
I've been troubling you.

342
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
I feel embarrassed.

343
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,280
There's no need to be shy,
Father-in-law.

344
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,400
Zhenxing.

345
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,640
Take Lingyi to rest for a while.

346
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,680
Yes.

347
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
I wonder if a conclusion
had been reached

348
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,480
regarding Ci'an Temple's case.

349
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,640
Thank you for your concern,
My Lord.

350
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,360
The Shuntian Prefecture Office
already closed the case.

351
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,520
Their investigation shows

352
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,960
that the pirate Liu Yong was the killer.

353
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
Liu Yong?

354
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,600
They closed the case so quickly.

355
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,960
It seems to be too hasty.

356
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
I'll go and talk

357
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,360
to Shuntian Prefect.

358
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,640
My Lord.

359
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Father also doesn't want this matter

360
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,520
to be the talk of the town.

361
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
After all, Concubine Lv

362
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,560
left the mansion without permission.

363
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,593
(Marquis has always been known
for directing military affairs)

364
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,415
(in a disciplined and upright way.)

365
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,782
(If the killer is really
from the Xu family,)

366
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,576
(Marquis won't stand for it.)

367
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,090
(Now, it seems like Marquis)

368
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:03,554
(is my last hope
in capturing the killer.)

369
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,680
Young Master.

370
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,080
My Lord.

371
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,040
Your wife said that Mr. Qian is here.

372
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,360
Please go to the front hall for a while.

373
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,240
You're not perceptive at all.

374
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,800
Don't you see me with My Lord?

375
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,560
It's fine.

376
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
I know the way to the Study Room.

377
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,360
Don't let me delay you.

378
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,720
Go ahead then, My Lord.

379
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,160
I'll be right back.

380
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,120
Mr. Luo

381
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,040
is prioritizing his reputation too much.

382
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,240
They closed the case
without investigating clearly.

383
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,240
That's so disappointing.

384
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,920
That's inappropriate.

385
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
They left the mansion
without permission.

386
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
If news about that really spreads,

387
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,200
it might harm

388
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,480
Concubine Lv's reputation.

389
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,600
Between investigating the case or not,

390
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,800
only the Luo family

391
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,200
can weigh the pros and cons.

392
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,760
My Lord.

393
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
What else do you want to say?

394
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,480
My Lord.

395
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,960
Rumors have been going around
our mansion

396
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,560
that the Luo family's concubine
and her daughter left the mansion

397
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,720
for another purpose.

398
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,240
They wanted to get close
to our household.

399
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm afraid they didn't expect

400
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,040
that a life would be lost because of it.

401
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm sorry.

402
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,920
I was...

403
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,160
Slandering someone behind her back.

404
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,200
Is this the Xu family's style?

405
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,320
Coming and going like a shadow,
eavesdropping and peeking?

406
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,280
Is this the demeanor of a lady

407
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
from the Luo family?

408
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,920
You don't need to worry

409
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,480
about the demeanor of a lady
from the Luo family.

410
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,920
The reason why we went out
of the mansion that day

411
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,360
had nothing to do with the Xu family,

412
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,240
and we didn't intend to seek connections
with the Xu family.

413
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,640
Even if my mother was lowly,

414
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,920
I won't allow others

415
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
to slander her.

416
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,279
My staff was rude.

417
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
I'll discipline him.

418
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,079
Please forgive him.

419
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,160
Lady Luo.

420
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,880
I shouldn't have said that.
I believed in hearsay.

421
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,200
Please be magnanimous.

422
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Forgive me.

423
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
What was said concerns my late mother.

424
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,520
If I've overstepped,

425
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,640
please forgive me.

426
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
It was my fault.

427
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll seek my own punishment
when we get back.

428
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
If such rumors spread again
at the mansion,

429
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,120
regardless if it's a servant
or a concubine,

430
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,480
one will be punished severely.

431
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
Yes, My Lord.

432
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,800
Your mother just passed away recently,

433
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,520
and you're trying
to seduce Marquis already.

434
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,880
Shiyi.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,680
What a deep love
between mother and daughter.

436
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,520
It's fine if you insult me.

437
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,680
But what you said

438
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,160
insulted Marquis too.

439
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,600
Do you dare to come with me

440
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
and explain to Marquis about it?

441
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,680
I'm not as shameless as you.

442
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,320
If chatting with Marquis a bit

443
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,440
is shameless,

444
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,920
Yuanniang is still alive,

445
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,320
and someone couldn't wait

446
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,840
to act like Marquis' wife,

447
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,760
isn't that utterly without shame?

448
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,720
You...

449
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,440
you have a sharp tongue.

450
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,000
You better know your place.

451
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,360
You're lucky Wang Yu likes you.

452
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,920
Even if you marry
into the Duke of Mao's family,

453
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,320
you're getting a good bargain.

454
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,120
I keep getting the feeling
that something's not right.

455
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,080
Before, Concubine Wang
unintentionally revealed

456
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
that Wang Yu likes me.

457
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
I think that's strange.

458
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,800
Wang Yu and I just met

459
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,880
in Xianling Pavilion once.

460
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,240
And back then,

461
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,160
he didn't know who I am.

462
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Now, Erniang said

463
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,040
that Wang Yu likes me.

464
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,040
Logically,

465
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,960
the Wang family

466
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,640
wouldn't talk about these things.

467
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,160
How did Erniang find out?

468
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
I think

469
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,800
this matter is quite strange.

470
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,040
Originally, the Wang family

471
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,320
already picked Erniang.

472
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,360
Yet they suddenly changed their mind

473
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
and wanted you to marry
into their family.

474
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,360
If you think about it carefully,

475
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,640
these matters aren't logical at all.

476
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,400
And the one who benefits from this

477
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,440
is Erniang.

478
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,800
Could it be that in order

479
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,920
to avoid marrying into the Wang family,

480
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,240
Erniang instigated things?

481
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
Harming others to benefit oneself

482
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
is something that she would do indeed.

483
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,160
That day, if Concubine Wang

484
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,360
didn't suddenly come here,

485
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
I could have left the mansion

486
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,000
together with mother.

487
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,120
Then she wouldn't be killed.

488
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,440
Originally, I had no intention
of competing with her.

489
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
But her scheme

490
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,160
indirectly got my mother killed.

491
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,960
Now,

492
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
she even wants to marry
into the Xu family

493
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,640
in a grand manner.

494
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,720
These are
the Wang family's wedding gifts.

495
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,400
Please take a look.

496
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Congratulations to the Luo
and Wang families for the marriage.

497
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,090
(Residence of Luo)

498
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,880
The Wang and Luo families

499
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,720
are both

500
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,200
so generous.

501
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,000
If every family

502
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,240
is like them,

503
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,960
I can retire earlier.

504
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,840
Yes.

505
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
Ma'am, please wait.

506
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,120
You're talking to me?

507
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,520
Ma'am, can you help me

508
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,600
give this portrait

509
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,800
to Mr. Wang?

510
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,960
I, Shiyi, will be utterly grateful.

511
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,720
You're Lady Shiyi?

512
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
No problem.

513
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm very happy to assist

514
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
in fulfilling someone's wish.

515
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,240
Lady Shiyi.

516
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,680
Give it to me.

517
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,320
Thank you.

518
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,600
These are all

519
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,280
popular items from Zhenbaozhai.

520
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
They must be expensive.

521
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,640
Erniang.

522
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,240
What are these things?

523
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,800
Mother.

524
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,080
Shiyi

525
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,320
is going to marry into the Wang family.

526
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,520
As her older sister,

527
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,120
I'm really happy for her.

528
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,080
These

529
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,800
are my gifts to her.

530
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,640
You're that nice?

531
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
What's the matter?

532
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,480
Don't you feel happy for Shiyi?

533
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,280
I heard that the son of Duke Mao

534
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,080
is a playboy.

535
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,400
I

536
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,040
just want to remind you

537
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,600
to dress yourself up nicely
in the future

538
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,200
and maintain your beauty.

539
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,680
That's how you can have

540
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,280
his affection.

541
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,120
Thank you for your concern.

542
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,400
But I think

543
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,400
that you need these more.

544
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,520
How gross.

545
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,760
Way out of line.

546
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,040
Mother.

547
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,880
I really have good intentions.

548
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
We're sisters.

549
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Of course I hope

550
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,400
that she and her husband will have
a good relationship.

551
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,800
In the future,

552
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,640
Mr. Wang will be
the Luo family's son-in-law.

553
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Erniang.

554
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
Don't say

555
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,680
these things again in the future.

556
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,560
Yes, Mother.

557
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,560
Where's Luo Shiyi?

558
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,080
Tell Luo Shiyi to come out!

559
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,000
You...

560
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,520
Do you dare

561
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,760
to touch the son of Duke Mao?

562
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,000
Sir.

563
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,440
Allow us to inform her.

564
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,520
Inform her?

565
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,680
Move!

566
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,920
Your Ladyship, Mr. Wang is barging in.

567
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,080
Mr. Wang

568
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,040
is so rude.

569
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,880
Where's Mr. Luo?

570
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,800
Mr. Luo left early in the morning.

571
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,120
What's the matter?

572
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,040
We just sent wedding gifts,

573
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,400
and you won't acknowledge me
as the son-in-law?

574
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,080
The Luo family

575
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,640
is even more powerful than me.

576
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,520
Mr. Wang is here.

577
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,960
Mr. Wang, please leave.

578
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,920
Go.

579
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,400
Yes.

580
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,600
I wasn't able to come and welcome
such an important guest.

581
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,480
Please forgive me.

582
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
Of course.

583
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Where's Shiyi?

584
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,240
Tell her to come out and see me.

585
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,280
Greetings,

586
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm Shiyi.

587
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,760
Why is it you?

588
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,040
You're Luo Shiyi,

589
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,560
the one

590
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,120
who'll marry me?

591
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,080
Mr. Wang.

592
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,160
She's Shiyi indeed.

593
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,000
Well...

594
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,200
what exactly is going on?

595
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,480
So you're here.

596
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,920
You've fooled me so hard.

597
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,920
Let me go.

598
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,560
Mother, save me!

599
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,160
Who's this?

600
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,600
She's Shiyi's older sister,

601
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,520
Erniang.

602
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Madam Luo.

603
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,720
Your daughter is incredible.

604
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,000
First, she seduced me,

605
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,160
saying that she's Luo Shiyi.

606
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,960
She said that the Luo family's
second daughter

607
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,080
is sickly.

608
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,760
That was why I asked my mother

609
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,360
to let me marry Luo Shiyi instead.

610
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,360
No, Mother.

611
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,360
That's not true.

612
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,560
Don't believe him, Mother!

613
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,680
Let her go.

614
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,560
Mr. Wang.

615
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,360
Is there

616
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,120
some kind of misunderstanding?

617
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,400
I don't care if there's
a misunderstanding.

618
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,840
She's the one I want.

619
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,400
I don't want to marry you!

620
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Let me go!

621
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,360
I'll kill you!

622
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Shut up!

623
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
Madam Luo.

624
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,480
From now on,

625
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,720
she's mine.

626
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Let me tell you.

627
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,560
Aside from her,

628
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,240
I don't want anyone.

629
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,920
Mother.

630
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,080
You and Erniang love each other.

631
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
As her mother,

632
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,640
I can only feel happy.

633
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,760
My Lady.

634
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,480
Come.

635
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,720
Erniang is tired.

636
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,920
Take her to her room.

637
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,400
Lady Erniang.

638
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,640
Please go back to your room and rest.

639
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,640
My Lady.

640
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,254
(Lanzhi Court)

641
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,880
Mother.

642
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,600
I'm begging you.

643
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,280
I don't want to marry Wang Yu.

644
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,680
He's a beast.

645
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,520
As long as you won't let me marry him,

646
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,360
I'm willing to do anything.

647
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,040
You're so scheming.

648
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,160
How can I help you?

649
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,120
He already did that

650
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,360
in front of everyone.

651
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,840
If you don't marry him,

652
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,240
who do you want to marry?

653
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,400
Your Ladyship.

654
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Think about it.

655
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,320
Wang Yu is asking to marry Erniang

656
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,560
to humiliate her

657
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,720
and seek revenge against her.

658
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,920
If you really let her marry him,

659
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
she'll surely

660
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,880
wish she were dead.

661
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Your Ladyship.

662
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,560
Since I've served you

663
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,240
for so many years,

664
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
please spare Erniang.

665
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,080
What you're saying

666
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,400
is that I'm harming Erniang?

667
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,320
What's the matter?

668
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,320
An illegitimate daughter

669
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,720
will become the Wang family's
future matron,

670
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,480
and she's aggrieved?

671
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,200
Mother.

672
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,960
I'm begging you.

673
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,240
I'd rather stay single for life.

674
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,160
I'll just stay beside you and serve you.

675
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,480
You even dare to say that?

676
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,120
Now, Wang Yu said

677
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,600
that he won't marry anyone but you.

678
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,520
Wasn't that your own doing?

679
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,160
Since you can't help me
with this matter,

680
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,040
and I'm doomed either way,

681
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
then...

682
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,480
then I'll just die here today!

683
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,000
My daughter.

684
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,000
Your Ladyship.

685
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,920
I'm begging you.

686
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,920
If you insist on letting Erniang
marry him,

687
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,440
The... two of us...

688
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,120
the two of us will seek our deaths!

689
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,040
Mom!

690
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,920
I can't stop you if you want to die.

691
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,480
It's good if you die too.

692
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,120
At least we can provide an explanation
to the Wang family.

693
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,360
Your Ladyship.

694
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Go.

695
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,520
Mom, what should we do?

696
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,640
Erniang.

697
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,880
Let's go.

698
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
If Wang Yu

699
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,040
didn't come here today,

700
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,600
I wouldn't know that Erniang

701
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,040
is capable of such schemes.

702
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,800
Usually,

703
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,680
she looked docile and submissive.

704
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,400
I can't believe that it's all an act.

705
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,240
If she marries into the Xu family,

706
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,040
in the future,

707
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,480
perhaps she'll stir up some troubles.

708
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,400
But Your Ladyship,

709
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,520
with all the fuss they made today,

710
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,800
will they make some trouble?

711
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,680
What if I go and take a look?

712
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,680
Barking dogs seldom bite.

713
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,040
If she really wants to die,

714
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,080
she can hang herself in her room.

715
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
Who can stop her?

716
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,160
But what if...

717
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,680
If she really means it,

718
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,280
I'll tell Madam Jiang

719
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,800
that if the Jiang family won't
become in-laws with Zhun,

720
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,320
everyone in the capital will know

721
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,520
that the son of Duke Mao
acted frivolously

722
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,360
towards the Luo family's daughter
and led to her death.

723
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,240
It seems like Her Ladyship

724
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,120
is set on letting you

725
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,200
marry Wang Yu.

726
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,360
For the sake of Zhun,

727
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,280
of course she'll sacrifice you.

728
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,880
She's ruthless.

729
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,920
I worked like a horse

730
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,640
to serve her all these years.

731
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,320
It's all in vain.

732
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,120
Our plan almost succeeded.

733
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,480
As long as Shiyi

734
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,080
marries into the Wang family,

735
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,160
I'll just wait to marry Marquis.

736
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,640
How did he find out?

737
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,000
It's all ruined.

738
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,280
He ruined everything.

739
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,920
What's the matter?

740
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,800
Did you hear any news?

741
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,440
I heard from Nanny Xu

742
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,400
that Lady Shiyi

743
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,560
told the matchmaker

744
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,480
to bring her portrait to Mr. Wang.

745
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,080
That was why Mr. Wang found out.

746
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,600
Shiyi.

747
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,160
My Lady.

748
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,840
You're willing

749
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,400
to marry Marquis as his second wife.

750
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,760
Is it because

751
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,480
you want to enter the Xu family

752
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,480
and investigate concubine's death?

753
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,680
My Lady.

754
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,720
You must think about this carefully.

755
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,760
Marriage is a major event in one's life.

756
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,720
Dongqing.

757
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,560
You know how important

758
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
my mother is to me.

759
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,200
Now, her death is unresolved.

760
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,920
I'll surely find the killer

761
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,520
and bring him to justice.

762
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,200
But my lady,

763
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
did you consider yourself?

764
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Look at Mr. Qian and Wuniang.

765
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
They're truly happy.

766
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
I hope

767
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,760
that you can also meet

768
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,720
someone who truly treasures you

769
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,040
and loves you.

770
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,240
I believe that that's what concubine

771
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,560
would want too.

772
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,480
To me,

773
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
nothing is more important

774
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,240
than this matter.

775
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,680
Your Ladyship.

776
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,640
Your Ladyship.

777
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,560
Lady Yuanniang...

778
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,080
Lady Yuanniang is in bad shape.

779
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,760
What?

780
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,200
Hurry.

781
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,440
Prepare the carriage to go
to the Xu family.

782
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,440
Tell Shiyi to come with me.

783
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,320
Yes.

784
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,080
We can only do everything we can

785
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,960
and let heaven do the rest.

786
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,280
Thank you, Physician.

787
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,320
I must find another physician
for Yuanniang.

788
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,679
Physician Liu is already
the best physician

789
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,119
in the Imperial Hospital.

790
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,880
What other physician can we find?

791
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,360
My Lord.

792
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
You must be disappointed in me.

793
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,520
Why are you suddenly saying that?

794
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,960
Because you obviously know

795
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,280
that I like Jiang Bai's daughter,

796
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,720
yet you're choosing
Jiang Song's daughter instead.

797
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,520
Jiang Bai is a government official.

798
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,520
Jiang Song is just a teacher.

799
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,080
It's not what you think.

800
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,760
Zhun is my child.

801
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,360
How can I harm him?

802
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,600
I suddenly remembered

803
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,640
the day I married into the Xu family.

804
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,360
I was sitting inside the room,

805
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,360
with a red cloth over my head.

806
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,600
I was so happy yet nervous.

807
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,120
How did we turn out this way?

808
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
I was too busy with battles,

809
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,600
and I've neglected you.

810
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,680
No.

811
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,040
It's my fault.

812
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,680
I let you down.

813
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,320
I can't

814
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,080
stay with you any longer.

815
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,720
My Lord.

816
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,840
Since I married into the family,

817
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,720
I really wanted to be

818
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,080
a good daughter-in-law

819
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,560
and a good wife.

820
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,000
But I was slow-witted.

821
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,600
I couldn't do anything well.

822
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,560
Don't blame me, My Lord.

823
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,080
It's all in the past now.

824
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,360
We're husband and wife.

825
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,960
I'll make another request

826
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,080
on behalf of Zhun.

827
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,680
Tell me.

828
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,000
After I die,

829
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,520
no one will take care of Zhun.

830
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
I really don't feel at ease.

831
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,720
My Lord.

832
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,600
Marry

833
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,400
Shiyi.

834
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,800
Your sister Shiyi is still young.

835
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,480
It's not appropriate for her to become
my wife.

836
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,880
Let's not hold her up.

837
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,000
How can you say
that you're holding her up?

838
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,920
My Lord.

839
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,640
I know the kind of person you are

840
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,600
very well.

841
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
If you don't agree,

842
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,200
even if I turn into ashes,

843
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,600
I won't rest in peace.

844
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,040
My Lord.

845
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,520
My Lord.

846
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,720
My Lord.

847
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,200
Please.

848
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,160
I'm begging you.

849
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,720
My Lord. Promise me, okay?

850
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,800
Promise me.

851
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,480
As long as she's willing,

852
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,280
I'll marry her.

853
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,480
Please give her a grand wedding,

854
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,000
so that she can help me

855
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,120
take care of Zhun here.

856
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,200

Don't be anxious.

860
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,160
She'll get better.

861
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Go and check on her.

862
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,360
Go.

863
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,000
This way.

864
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,080
This way.

865
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,080
Let's go.

866
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,800
My pitiful daughter.

867
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,920
Mother.

868
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,080
Don't worry.

870
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,760

873
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,320
I can finally die in peace.

874
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,120
Shiyi.

875
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,840
Come here.

the Marquis Yongping's Mansion

879
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,000
but there's danger everywhere.

880
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,720
It's strange that I've caught
such an illness.

881
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,880
It's incurable.

882
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,200
You're mature.

883

I feel most at ease with you.

884

I'll let you take care

885

All right.

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,080
Yes.

Zhun.

Mother, don't cry.

892
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
Zhun is still young.

893
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,360
He'll feel scared.
