=The Sword and the Brocade=

18
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,250
=Episode 7=

19
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,360
His Lordship has been staying
in Banyuepan for the past few days.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,360
He won't see anyone.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,560
Well,

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,120
Her Ladyship had already been sick

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,360
for so long.

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,760
His Lordship should have already known

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,960
that this would happen.

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,040
They're husband and wife after all.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,160
Yes.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
But Her Ladyship

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,040
really expended much thought on this.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,119
She just passed away,

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,240
and her sister is going to marry
into this family.

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
After the one-year mourning period,

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,200
the position of Marquis Yongping's wife

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,160
will still belong to the Luo family.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
I think Her Ladyship
arranged it that way

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
because she was worried about Zhun.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
His Lordship agreed to marry Shiyi

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
just for the sake of his relationship

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
with Her Ladyship.

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,080
You're right,

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,760
but

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,520
the future wife of His Lordship

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,960
is the daughter of a concubine,

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
unlike you.

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,960
Logically, you should become

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
the legal wife.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
It's a shame

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
that things didn't work out that way.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,040
I already feel satisfied that I'm able

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,320
to stay by His Lordship's side.

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
I don't want anything else.

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
You care about His Lordship so much.

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,360
I admire you.

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,480
But when I think

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,280
of the fact that someone
with a high status like you

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,800
must humble yourself towards
that illegitimate daughter

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,360
and serve her

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,080
in the future,

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,880
I feel bad for you.

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,480
You're so concerned for me.

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,560
I'll surely remember that.

62
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,320
Tomorrow, I'll write a letter
to my home,

63
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,880
and ask my father to take care

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,880
of the Wen family's business more.

65
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,000
Lianfang, I didn't mean anything
by saying that.

66
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
Lianfang.

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,840
I didn't mean anything by that.

68
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,640
Don't be angry.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
The family's matron just passed away.

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
Not only don't they feel any grief,

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
but they're even
busy fighting for favors.

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
What's the use of having
such wives?

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,960
His Lordship has been in low spirits
during the past few days.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,320
He wouldn't eat or sleep.

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,320
I'm really worried.

76
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,840
I remember when Yuanniang just married
into the family.

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,480
She and Lingyi

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,520
were courteous to each other.

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,680
But later on,

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
too many things happened.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,960
That was why they slowly grew apart.

82
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
Since father and my husband died,

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,080
His Lordship supported the entire
Xu family alone.

84
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,840
But regardless if it's the government
or his wives,

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
I don't think he ever felt
at ease about them.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,640
I hope that after Luo Shiyi marries
into the family,

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,920
things will change.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm afraid Luo Shiyi

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
isn't easy to get along with either.

90
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,480
Regarding that incident when Lianfang
married into the family,

91
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm afraid

92
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,640
that she and Yuanniang planned it.

93
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,800
She is so scheming.

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,640
How can I feel at ease?

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,360
If Lingyi didn't already
make a promise,

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
I would never agree

97
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
to this marriage.

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,080
Mother.

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
I can understand

100
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,880
Yuanniang's reasons.

101
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
She was afraid that the second wife

102
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,480
will not treat Zhun well.

103
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,040
Being the Marquis's legal wife
is a huge responsibility.

104
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
Is it fine

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,000
just for her

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
to be a good stepmother?

107
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,480
Can an illegitimate daughter

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,560
manage the entire Xu household?

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,600
Mother.

110
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,560
Aren't you still here?

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,440
As long as she knows her place

112
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,960
and treats His Lordship well,

113
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
that will be enough.

114
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Excuse me.

115
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,240
I want to find Qingming.

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,880
Is he around?

117
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,560
Qingming?

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,160
He went out with our master.

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,240
Do you know where he went?

120
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,280
I don't.

121
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,552
(One year later)

122
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
(Happiness)

123
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,640
Sweep in there.

124
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,680
And over here too.

125
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,080
Higher.

126
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,160
Place them here.

127
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,760
Go back to work.

128
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Nanny Liu, is this fine?

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,520
All right.

130
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
A bit higher over there.

131
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,640
-Higher.
-All right.

132
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
(Happiness)
All right.

133
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,960
Shiyi.

134
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,840
Wuniang.

135
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,920
Sit down.

136
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,040
Your wedding dress is so nice.

137
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,160
The Marquis will surely
find you stunning.

138
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,160
I really can't bear for you to leave.

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Those concubines
in Marquis Yongping's Mansion

140
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,360
aren't easy to deal with at all.

141
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,280
You must take good care of yourself.

142
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,320
All right, Wuniang.

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
I'll take good care of myself.

144
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm so envious of you.

145
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,960
Your husband treats you so well.

146
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,720
Qian Ming is really nice to me.

147
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,680
It's just that he failed again
in this imperial exam.

148
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,520
Let's not talk about it.

149
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,840
Oh, right.

150
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,880
Some time ago,

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
I saw Erniang.

152
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
How is she doing?

153
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,680
Since she got married,

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
she never visited here.

155
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,880
Based on her personality,

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
will she get bullied?

157
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
Don't worry.

158
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,640
This is your wedding day.

159
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,840
She'll surely come.

160
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,880
Get ready first.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
I'll go out and check things for you.

162
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,240
All right.

163
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
Amber, walk her out.

164
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,720
Yes.

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Her Ladyship is here.

166
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,840
Mother.

167
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,880
Are you ready?

168
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,640
Yes, Mother.

169
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,560
After getting married today,

170
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,640
you'll be the wife of Marquis Yongping.

171
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,960
You won't be as carefree there
as you are here.

172
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,240
Remember, be cautious in your words
and actions.

173
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,360
You can't make any mistakes.

174
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,440
The servants in the Marquis's mansion

175
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,320
are all arrogant.

176
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,800
Perhaps they're the concubines' spies.

177
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,680
If someone is disrespectful,

178
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,920
beat or punish them if you must.

179
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Remember.

180
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
If the wife isn't strict, the concubines
will become bold.

181
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,200
I'll remember that.

182
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Don't forget Yuanniang's last words.

183
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
You promised her

184
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,200
that you'll take good care of Zhun.

185
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,920
I'll surely do as I've promised,

186
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
and take good care of Zhun.

187
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
I won't disappoint Yuanniang.

188
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,080
It's been over a year.

189
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,600
Why did that little monk

190
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,880
suddenly disappear?

191
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,840
He's been gone for so long.

192
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
I can't find any traces of him.

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
Don't worry, My Lady.

194
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,160
We'll surely be able to find
the real killer.

-Yes.
-Yes.

209
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,280
That's right.

210
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,160
All right.

211
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,960
Please go ahead.

212
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,920
My Lady, Marquis is here.

213
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,760
Please answer this harder question.

214
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,200
The foundation of governance originated
from doctrines, which originated from virtues.

215
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
Since ancient times, rulers

216
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,760
must strike a compromise with Confucius.

217
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Confucius told Lord of Lu to rule
using the "Nine Classics"

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,680
and return to the three virtues.

219
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
And Sima Guang
from the Song Dynasty said

220
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
that there are three virtues
for emperors:

221
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,960
benevolence, understanding,
courageousness.

222
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,520
It coincides
with Confucius' views indeed.

223
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,920
Mr. Luo.

224
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,640
This isn't

225
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,920
an imperial exam.

226
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
Change the question.

227
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,160
His Lordship isn't even married yet,

228
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,360
and you're already helping him.

229
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,000
I...

230
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
What is the foundation?

231
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,920
When the timing is right,

232
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,880
push the policies,

233
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,480
which is all-inclusive,

234
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,040
but not indulgent.

235
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
With foresight and abstruse cognition,

236
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,000
scrutinize without fail.

237
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,280
Assume overall responsibility
in an assertive way,

238
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,720
but not be too harsh.

239
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,840
Observe the changes in the dynamic
and static Yin and Yang

240
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,160
and its effects or traces.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,720
What is the best way of governance?

242
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,160
To be on the level of great
ancient emperors,

243
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,520
you must cultivate morality.

244
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,080
Otherwise, even if you have strategy
and wisdom,

245
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,760
it will become prejudice
and ignorance.

246
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
-Nice.
-Incredible.

247
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,280
Great.

248
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,200
"Even if you have the facilities,

249
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,080
it will become personal opinions
and tricks.

250
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,800
Even if you have strategy and wisdom,

251
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,200
it will only become prejudice
and ignorance."

252
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,680
I welcome my good son-in-law.

253
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,520
This way please.

Since you're already married,

306
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,280
you must do this sooner or later.

she has already married

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,280
We should call her Her Ladyship now.

314
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,120
I know.

315
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,680
I just temporarily forgot.

316
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,920
(It will be fine.)

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,880
(There's nothing to be scared of.)

319
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,800
(There's no use being afraid.)

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,320
Dongqing.

321
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,520
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

322
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,040
You're the only one

323
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,040
who'd look directly
into the groom's eyes

324
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,640
at this moment.

325
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,000
I heard that only those
with ulterior motives

326
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,840
are afraid of looking
into people's eyes.

327
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,800
You're still so garrulous.

328
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I'll go and remove my make-up.

329
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,360
Since you've already married
into the Xu family,

330
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,520
you must follow the house rules

331
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,760
and know your place.

332
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,880
I'll let bygones be bygones.

333
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
I won't tolerate

334
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,920
what you and Yuanniang did again.

335
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,480
Since that's what you think,

336
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,680
I'll just listen to your instructions.

337
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Dongqing.

338
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,640
Dongqing.

339
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,139
(Happiness)

340
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,160
(Please give her a grand wedding,)

341
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,080
(so that she can help me)

342
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,200
(take care of Zhun here.)

343
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,840
Must you look at me this way?

344
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,800
Close your eyes.

345
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,600
I'm sorry, My Lord.

346
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,480
I think I ate something bad.

347
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,480
I want to go and drink some water.

348
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,400
Go.

349
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,800
Lianfang.

350
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
You're a good kid.

351
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,160
Lingyi is just busy
with military affairs

352
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
and has no time for you.

353
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,880
His Lordship is loyal to the nation

354
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,360
and working for His Majesty.

355
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,720
He's already so tired.

356
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,120
How can I

357
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,960
just think about
our personal relationship?

358
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,280
I just want to take good care of you,

359
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,560
so that His Lordship will have nothing
to worry about.

360
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,520
I feel bad for you,

361
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,680
Lianfang.

362
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,840
I feel bad.

363
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,160
Letting you be a concubine

364
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,600
is making you aggrieved enough.

365
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,120
Look, Lingyi

366
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,280
even got another legal wife now.

367
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,760
Great Madam.

368
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,280
I just want

369
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,520
to stay by His Lordship's side.

370
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,360
I already feel satisfied with that.

371
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,240
Besides,

372
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,400
you love me so much.

373
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,640
I'm not hoping for anything else.

374
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,800
Lianfang.

375
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,440
Don't worry.

376
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,080
As long as I'm here,

377
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,800
I surely won't let Lingyi

378
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,400
treat you badly.

379
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,600
Thank you for your concern, Great Madam.

380
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,520
I originally wanted to make His Lordship
be enamored with me

381
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,280
before that illegitimate daughter
marries into the family.

382
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,920
I didn't expect

383
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,760
that in the past year,

384
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,960
His Lordship only returned
to the mansion a few times.

385
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,920
Now that a new wife has married
into the family,

386
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
it will be harder to make His Lordship

387
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,000
enamored with me.

388
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,240
Don't overthink.

389
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,640
His Lordship has always been cold
towards his wives.

390
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,920
It's not that he doesn't like you.

391
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,800
Even when Luo Yuanniang was still alive,

392
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,480
he has always maintained his distance.

393
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
Even if she is born with a low status,

394
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,120
she's still been

395
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,640
the matron of the family.

396
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
What if...

397
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,360
I mean what if

398
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,760
His Lordship likes her?

399
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,960
What should I do?

400
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,960
You're so ingenious and exquisite,

401
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,560
and you weren't able to make
His Lordship fall for you.

402
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
Luo Shiyi

403
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,800
is just an illegitimate daughter.

404
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,120
Based on talent and knowledge,

405
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,240
how can she compare to you?

406
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,560
How can His Lordship like her?

407
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Besides,

408
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,280
she got to her position now

409
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,280
due to Luo Yuanniang's trick.

410
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,480
His Lordship is discerning.

411
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,040
How can he not be able to tell?

412
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,840
If I can hold onto that,

413
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,800
I don't need to aggrieve myself.

414
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,400
It's good that you understand.

415
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Besides,

416
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,160
His Lordship is a filial son.

417
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,000
Here,

418
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
Great Madam calls the shots.

419
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,600
As long as she takes care of you,

420
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,800
no one will dare

421
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,400
to look down on you in the Xu family.

422
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,680
Young Madam.

423
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,280
Tonight

424
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,840
is the wedding night of Shiyi

425
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,200
and Marquis Yongping.

426
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,480
It's late.

427
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,320
Get some rest.

428
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,640
That should be me.

429
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,240
Young Madam.

430
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,600
Forget about the past.

431
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,080
If you keep thinking about it,

432
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,320
you'll only suffer more.

433
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,400
Forget it?

434
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,920
How can I?

435
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,200
My life

436
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,640
is ruined.

437
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
Sir.

438
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,760
Dear.

439
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,600
You... You're back.

440
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,240
Dear.

441
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,560
This is my dowry,

442
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,280
an accessory I brought when I married
into the family.

443
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,640
Between us,

444
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,240
why should we distinguish things
so clearly?

445
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
No.

446
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,080
You can't take it.

447
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,280
You really won't let go?

448
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,400
Young Madam.

449
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,360
Give it to His Lordship.

450
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,600
Young Madam.

451
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,840
You're spending money
from your wife's dowry.

452
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,520
What kind of man are you?

453
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,960
I'll make you let go!

454
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,480
I'll make you give it to me!

455
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,280
Sir!

456
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,160
This is a rebellion!

457
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,680
Stop it!

458
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,692
(Mansion of Xu)

459
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,560
My Lord, you're awake so early.

460
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
Did I scare you?

461
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,240
No.

462
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
You're leaving so soon?

463
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,640
I must go to the palace.

464
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,480
It's still early.

465
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,400
Sleep more.

466
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,040
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

467
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,200
Shiyi is still sleeping.

468
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,080
Don't bother her for now.

469
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,640
-Yes.
-Yes.

470
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,389
(Happiness)

471
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,360
Dongqing.

472
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,720
Are my clothes ready?

473
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,960
Today is the first time

474
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,120
that I'll greet Great Madam.

475
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,320
I can't be late.

476
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,360
Don't worry.

477
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,560
I've prepared it already.

478
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Look at this.

479
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,560
It definitely matches your status.

480
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,680
That's too exaggerated.

481
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,680
The Luo family

482
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,200
isn't a powerful and influential family.

483
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,920
This is too elaborate.

484
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,000
Go get

485
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,440
an elegant and ordinary cloth.

486
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,160
You don't know
Her Ladyship's preference.

487
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,480
I'll get it.

488
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,040
If you don't have anything to do,

489
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
clean the yard.

490
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,520
Don't just stay indoors.

491
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,360
Amber.

492
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,200
How long have you been in the capital?

493
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,680
Since I was little,

494
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,920
I've been living in the capital.

495
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,360
Dongqing won't be able

496
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,360
to handle all the affairs indoors.

497
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,239
You and Dongqing

498
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,320
can handle them together.

499
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,080
Yes, Your Ladyship.

500
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,000
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

501
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,000
All right.

502
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,400
Check if Great Madam is awake already.

503
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
We should get going.

504
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,480
Yes.

505
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,000
Your Ladyship.

506
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,600
How can you let her

507
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,159
take care of the affairs indoors?

508
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,360
Have you forgotten?

509
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,199
Amber is Madam Luo...

510
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,280
That's enough.

511
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,280
Amber isn't a bad person.

512
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,800
She just has no choice.

513
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Besides,

514
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,920
there's nothing to hide

515
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,159
in here.

516
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,440
Mother will feel at ease

517
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,600
if she knows.

518
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,560
If she feels at ease,

519
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,880
she won't give me a hard time.

520
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,239
That way, I can focus

521
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,679
on doing what I want.

522
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,400
That's enough.

523
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,880
I know that you're concerned about me.

524
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
But Amber, you and I

525
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,520
are on the same boat now.

526
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,160
Don't always give her a hard time.

527
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,520
All right, Your Ladyship.

528
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,960
I'll listen to you.

529
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,800
The Fujian province is small
and densely populated.

530
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,840
Grains are scarce.

531
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,360
That's why citizens who live
along the coast

532
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,240
treat boats as their homes

533
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,400
and the sea as their fields.

534
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,680
They make a living
through maritime trading.

535
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,320
(Ren Kun)
Since the ban is too strict,

536
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,600
the citizens are poor.

537
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,800
Some people will be forced by bandits

538
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,440
to become pirates.

539
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,213
This is an evil in our nation.

540
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,827
(Grand Secretary Chen)

541
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
Forcing good citizens to become pirates
is so painful.

542
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,280
(Marquis Jingyuan)
That's why

543
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,600
to help citizens make a living

544
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,560
and to maintain peace in Fujian
and Zhejiang,

545
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,200
we must lift the sea ban.

546
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,120
We must open up the sea.

547
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Not necessarily.

548
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,320
If the sea ban didn't strengthen
our defenses and hide our provisions,

549
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,960
the pirates

550
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,880
wouldn't stop at the coast.

551
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,720
If we lift it,

552
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,000
the pirates will take shares

553
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,440
of the fertile lands
in the Central Plains.

554
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,400
How can there be peace?

555
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,640
Marquis Yongping.

556
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,720
Do you want to invite disasters
by letting invaders in?

557
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,280
In receiving His Majesty's favor,
one must work loyally for him.

558
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,960
Isn't it our jobs

559
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,640
to maintain our coast defense

560
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,360
and eliminate pirates?

561
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,640
If we stop maritime trading

562
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,120
just because of pirates,

563
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,000
isn't that like not eating
for fear of choking

564
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,480
and getting paid without doing any work?

565
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,440
The sea ban policy

566
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,680
was established
by Emperor Taizu himself.

567
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,040
How can we distort the policy this way?

568
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,200
Marquis Yongping, be careful
with your words.

569
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,320
Our dynasty was just established
back then.

570
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,320
The bandits were mostly originated
from the ports.

571
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,360
That was why Emperor Taizu set
the sea ban policy.

572
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,000
It's not the same anymore.

573
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,880
Banditry actually arose
from the sea ban.

574
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,120
Do you all know

575
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,920
that because of the sea ban policy,
citizens of Fujian and Zhejiang

576
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
are living in poverty.

577
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,240
They've already come to a point

578
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,760
where they're selling their children.

579
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,600
Marquis Yongping.

580
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,120
You're just exaggerating
to attract attention.

581
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,280
His Majesty is making great efforts
to build a strong state.

582
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,600
The Ming Dynasty is prosperous
and the citizens are at peace.

583
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,440
How can such a terrible thing happen?

584
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,600
Vice Minister Ou, you've never been
to the southeast regions.

585
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,600
How do you know that it's not true?

586
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,760
Pirates are wreaking havoc these days.

587
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,960
The citizens are living in misery.

588
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,280
How can you say that the nation
is prosperous

589
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,400
and the citizens are at peace?

590
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,320
(Ou Lixing)
Official Fan.

591
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,840
Are you blaming His Majesty?

592
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,440
You...

593
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,520
Duke Wei.

594
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
What do you think?

595
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,480
Lifting the ban

596
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,080
will help in eliminating
the pirates indeed.

597
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,840
But the sea ban

598
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,200
concerns our ancestral policy.

599
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,680
We must report to His Majesty

600
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,440
before having another discussion.

601
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,360
What Duke Wei said makes sense.

602
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
The priority now

603
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,000
is to carry out

604
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,440
the tea duty reform.

605
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,320
Marquis Yongping, let's talk
about the tax duty first.

606
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,960
Don't create more troubles.

607
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,280
-Grand Secretary.
-Grand Secretary.

608
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,440
Yes, Grand Secretary.

609
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,560
Is the wooden horse interesting?

610
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
You're very happy, right?

611
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,720
Do you like to play with me?

612
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,520
Yes.

613
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,080
Look at how happy Zhun is

614
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,280
in playing with you.

615
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,200
All of us here

616
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,480
seem out of place.

617
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
How come?

618
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,240
How can I compare

619
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,680
with you?

620
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,080
You love your grandmother
the most, right?

621
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,880
Right?

622
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,920
Greetings, Mother.

623
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,920
Stand.

624
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,680
Thank you, Mother.

625
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,200
These are some pieces of my old jewelry.

626
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
If you don't mind,

627
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,480
take them.

628
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,440
Thank you, Mother.

629
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,480
Come.

630
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,400
Lianfang, meet her.

631
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,960
She's Lianfang.

632
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,320
From now on,

633
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,240
you must get along well.

634
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,760
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

635
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
