My Lord.

21
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,060
You can set your mind
at rest now, My Lord.

(Official Document)

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,020
I hope that after this experience,

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,700
Zhun can become stronger

25
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,220
and get rid of his weakness of the past.

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,060
As far as I am concerned,

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,340
being your son

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,220
is the hardest work in this world.

29
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,540
Your words are not exactly right.

30
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,420
What is wrong with my words?

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,340
Putting it exactly, being my son is the
second hardest work in the world.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,500
Then what is the number one hardest?

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,140
To work as my Deputy General.

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,620
My Lord, I was wrong.

35
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,500
(Official Document)

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,140
How are you doing
with the investigation?

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,940
I have completed it.

38
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,740
It was Mrs Liu of the Xishan Villa

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,020
who has put the dog in the box

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,180
when the cargo was carried
to the warehouse.

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,340
Then she gave it to Concubine Qiao.

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,060
(Official Document)

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,980
Zhun fell ill when Mrs Liu

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,140
brought a dog to our mansion.

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,700
And then Mrs Liu was sent away.

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,580
What a coincidence!

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,740
My Lord, you are thinking that

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,180
since the dog that
caused Zhun to fall ill

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,940
was given to Concubine Qiao by Mrs Liu,

50
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,820
so Zhun didn't fall ill by accident.

51
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,580
We can't jump to a conclusion
about this now.

52
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,940
Whether this dog

53
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,500
was presented by Mrs Liu or not,

54
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,100
there is no proof that Lianfang knew

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,060
it was carrying exopathogen

56
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,540
and would do harm to Zhun.

57
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,660
So Mrs Liu

58
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,340
is the important witness in this case.

59
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,340
But now her whereabouts is unknown.

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,300
My Lord, don't worry.

61
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,820
Wherever she is hiding now,

62
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,420
I will find her and bring her back.

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,140
My Lord,

64
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,700
as Zhun's recovery from illness,

65
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,860
you should thank one person decently.

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,420
If Her Ladyship hadn't been
scrupulous enough

67
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,740
to find the source of illness,

68
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,660
Zhun's life might be in real danger.

69
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,300
♪There is a rooster♪

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,220
Now Zhun is out of danger.

75
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,260
You can feel relieved now,
Your Ladyship.

76
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,580
You have been tiring yourself
during this period of time.

77
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,580
Now you must have a good rest.

78
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,060
However,

79
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,020
the Great Madam is partial
to Concubine Qiao.

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,820
Your Ladyship,
how do you like my massage?

81
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,900
You are applying the right strength.

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,020
It makes me feel very comfortable.

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,140
Even if Concubine Qiao
didn't harbor evil intentions

84
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,900
in the case of the dog,

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
how could she prove her innocence

86
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,700
in the case of you being kidnapped later?

87
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,260
Now Mrs Liu and the two guards

88
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,180
vanished into thin air.

89
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,940
I don't believe that she was
not involved in this.

90
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,420
Think about it.

91
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,620
If people found that

92
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,460
my chastity was defiled

93
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,820
after I was kidnapped

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,060
and then Zhun died of the tinea,

95
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,100
what result, do you think
there would be?

96
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,020
The result would be that His Lordship

97
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,420
would lose both his legal wife
and his legitimate son.

98
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,140
Given the Great Madam's partiality
for Concubine Qiao,

99
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,540
it is very possible that

100
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,740
she would be made legal wife
of His Lordship.

101
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,540
In this sense,

102
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,420
Concubine Qiao has plotted

103
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,980
this series of evil doings.

104
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,460
She is so evil and cold-hearted.

105
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,380
If she continues to be in charge
of the family affairs,

106
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,660
I am afraid Her Ladyship and Zhun

107
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,980
would fall into danger again.

108
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,340
It is a pity that

109
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,860
we don't have conclusive evidence.

110
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,260
Why is the evidence necessary?

111
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,060
In the whole Xu Family,

112
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,460
except Concubine Qiao,

113
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,100
who else has a mind

114
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,500
to harm Zhun and Her Ladyship?

115
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,540
The tree desires stillness,
but the wind will not cease.

116
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,700
Based on the current situation,

117
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,620
I can't stay forbearing any more.

118
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,220
Well, what is your plan, Your Ladyship?

119
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,460
First of all, I can't allow her

120
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,420
to continue taking care of Zhun.

121
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,500
You want Shiyi to take care of Zhun

122
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,900
in the coming days?

123
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,460
I am not objecting to your proposal.

124
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,340
My worry is just that

125
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,220
Shiyi is still young

126
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,060
and she has no experience
of raising children,

127
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,580
so in some matters,

128
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,220
she might not be well-advised.

129
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,140
This time Zhun recovered his health

130
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,500
thanks to Shiyi.

131
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Besides, she has her way

132
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,700
to make Zhun obey her.

133
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,300
So she is the most suitable person

134
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,500
to take care of Zhun.

135
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,500
Though she rendered great service
in Zhun's recovery,

136
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,180
Lianfang and the others also

137
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,060
helped a lot.

138
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
She helped a lot?

139
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,180
I am thankful that
she didn't do a disservice.

140
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,100
Great Madam,

141
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,420
I also think

142
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,100
His Lordship's words make sense.

143
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,900
After all, Zhun is Her Ladyship's son

144
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,140
in name.

145
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,540
Mother.

146
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,660
Shiyi is the legal wife
of His Lordship

147
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,340
and the sister of Zhun's biological
mother Yuanniang.

148
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,380
Though she didn't give birth to Zhun,

149
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,060
they are bound by blood.

150
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,460
It is justifiable for her

151
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,060
to bring up Zhun.

152
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,820
Great Madam can't bear to see

153
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,580
Zhun grow without a mother, right?

154
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,340
Since you all said so,

155
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,820
let it be so.

156
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
However,

157
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,860
Zhun must continue to live in my place.

158
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,380
Of course.

159
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,420
You love Zhun so dearly, Mother.

160
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,660
It is his blessing.

161
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,140
Why did His Lordship suggest

162
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,300
Her Ladyship

163
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,740
take over Zhun?

164
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
If Her Ladyship

165
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,620
and the legitimate son become closer,

166
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,260
your interests will be
greatly jeopardized,

167
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,940
madam.

168
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,700
We'd better

169
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,500
figure out other ways to deal with it.

170
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,860
Madam?

171
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,780
Let's drop this topic.

172
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,140
I am more worried

173
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,580
about another matter.

174
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,100
What is it?

175
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,940
I don't know whether I got it wrong.

176
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,540
But I have got a feeling that

177
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,300
His Lordship has changed
his opinion of Her Ladyship.

178
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,700
It seems that he has
started to trust her.

179
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,660
That's because she
has taken advantage of

180
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,060
Zhun's illness

181
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,820
and gone to all lengths

182
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,260
to impress His Lordship.

183
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,380
But she has successfully

184
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,580
made His Lordship look
at her with new eyes.

185
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,580
I tried so hard.

186
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,860
I have been trying so hard,

187
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,740
but failed

188
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,140
while she won

189
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,940
hands down.

190
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,420
Tell me.

191
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,420
Have I helped her

192
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,900
unknowingly?

193
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,020
You are so skillful
with your hands, Your Ladyship.

194
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,900
Everything made by you is beautiful.

195
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,220
Your Ladyship, Zhaoying is here.

196
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,220
Your Ladyship,

197
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,380
His Lordship ordered me
to bring you this.

198
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,060
He said that

199
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,860
this was a reward for your hard work
over this period of time.

200
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,100
What is it?

201
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,500
It is the brocade-feather fan.

202
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,060
Brocade-feather fan?

203
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,700
This brocade-feather fan is made of

204
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,940
lustrous and resilient feathers.

205
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,020
The more unusual thing is that

206
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,780
the feathers look gorgeous and bright

207
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,140
and possess a natural charm.

208
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,740
I guess it must be very valuable.

209
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,260
Your Ladyship, you don't know that

210
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,340
it is made by His Lordship himself.

211
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,740
Thank His Lordship for
bestowing it on me.

212
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,380
What else?

213
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,620
Your Ladyship.

214
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,020
Such a classy brocade-feather fan

215
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,860
is rare even in the imperial palace.

216
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,980
Your Ladyship, so don't you think...

217
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,300
Dongqing.

218
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,180
What? Isn't it enough?

219
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,660
Yes, it is enough.

220
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,460
Thank you for your reward.

221
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,020
If you don't need my service now,

222
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,420
please allow me
to take leave, Your Ladyship.

223
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,020
Your Ladyship.

224
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,620
All servants of the Xu Family

225
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,620
want some rewards when
doing you a little service.

226
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,780
The monthly payment

227
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,700
we managed to save up

228
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,340
is not enough to cover
all these expenses.

229
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,460
You've got a point.

230
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,900
It seems that

231
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,580
we have to figure out a
way to deal with it.

232
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,980
Dongqing.

233
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,700
Don't even think of it! No way!

234
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,380
I have no private savings.

235
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,540
I want to ask you to put away the fan.

236
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,460
My Lord,

237
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,020
you look a bit perturbed.

238
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,940
My Lord, the brocade-feather
fan you gave Her Ladyship

239
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,500
boasts beautiful and bright colors

240
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,940
and is really precious.

241
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,700
When Her Ladyship receives it,

242
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,980
she must be very grateful.

243
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,220
I guess she might be heading here

244
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,780
together with Zhaoying.

245
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,020
I am not expecting

246
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,580
she will come to extend thanks
after receiving my gift.

247
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,260
-Zhaoying.
-My Lord.

248
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,220
Why are you back alone?

249
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,820
Her Ladyship has accepted
the brocade-feather fan

250
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,020
and she asked me to

251
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,700
extend her thanks to you.

252
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,100
What else?

253
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,020
That's all.

254
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,100
How could that be all?

255
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,300
What's more,

256
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,020
Her Ladyship rewarded me with silver.

257
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,540
It is enough to know she
has accepted the fan.

258
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
I hope that in the coming days,

259
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,580
she can take care of
Zhun more devotedly.

260
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,460
Linbo.

261
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,140
Would you like to patrol
the city tonight?

262
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,180
No, I'd rather not.

263
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,500
Seeing that you are so concerned about

264
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,940
the safety of the populace
of the capital city,

265
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,820
I think I must allow you to do that.

266
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,300
Otherwise, I will dampen
your enthusiasm for

267
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,660
serving His Majesty and
protecting the people.

268
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,860
That's not my actual thought.

269
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,220
Zhaoying,

270
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,500
prepare food and water for him.

271
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,460
-Yes, My Lord.
-Hurry.

272
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,380
Yes, My Lord.

273
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,620
My Lord! My Lord!

274
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,380
Zhaoying!

275
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,980
Zhaoying!

276
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,340
-Try again.
-Zhun.

277
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,700
You almost succeeded.

278
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,900
It is lucky that the Marquis

279
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,900
distinguished right from wrong
and handled things fairly,

280
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,940
as a result,

281
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,300
you didn't suffer wrong.

282
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,660
We outsiders

283
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,660
only know that he
is serious and majestic.

284
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,820
We never expected that

285
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,940
he also has a soft side.

286
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,620
Stop talking about me.

287
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,820
How have you been
doing recently, Wuniang?

288
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,300
Is everything going well in family?

289
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,900
Yes, everything is fine with my family.

290
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,780
The only problem is that

291
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,020
I am always so idle.

292
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,620
It is not a good thing.

293
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,740
I have to find something to do.

294
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Now

295
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,260
I am planning to start a
business to make money.

296
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,780
Are you interested in
joining hands with me?

297
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,380
What is the business?

298
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,300
I want to open a dried fruit shop.

299
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,940
I have decided on the store.

300
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,260
It is located in the West Street.

301
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,260
A lot of people will pass by.

302
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,740
I think the location is good.

303
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,940
I have also found the source of goods.

304
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,340
It sounds good.

305
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,020
But it entails a lot of money, right?

306
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,460
Yes.

307
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,980
If we do it together,

308
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,420
we can each contribute 100 tael of
silver as capital.

309
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,700
I think that will be enough.

310
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,860
Let me work out the accounts for you.

311
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,940
The rental of the store will be

312
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,420
fifty tael of silver per year.

313
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,660
We can first stock our shop
with half of the goods.

314
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,540
All the assistants will
be our own people.

315
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,860
We only need to fill
their empty stomachs at first.

316
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,420
After a year,

317
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,980
we will be able to

318
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,900
earn 200 or 300 tael of silver at least.

319
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,620
I know that

320
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,140
now you are not

321
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,540
the past you anymore.

322
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,500
A profit of 200 or 300 tael of silver

323
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,900
is no longer attractive to you.

324
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,260
But, think about this.

325
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,020
If you can make this
extra amount of money,

326
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,420
you will be able to buy

327
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,660
some rouge and face powder.

328
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,780
Isn't that nice?

329
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
This is the first time for me

330
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,980
to hear this, Wuniang.

331
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,820
I am not sure about it now.

332
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,700
Could you please

333
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,380
grant me several days to think about it?

334
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,580
Then I will give you a reply.

335
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,100
OK. No problem.

336
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,700
But you'd better hurry.

337
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,700
The Spring Festival
is around the corner.

338
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,740
Every family will buy boxes
of dried fruit as gifts

339
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,860
to visit their relatives.

340
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,580
Have you heard of

341
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,700
what happened to Erniang?

342
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,340
Wang Yu got drunk a few days ago.

343
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,740
Then he fought with
others in the street.

344
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Unexpectedly, he messed with someone
that cannot be trifled with.

345
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,420
The opponent kept causing our
sister's trouble for quite a few days.

346
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,380
These days,

347
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,260
Erniang has been

348
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,780
harassed by this matter greatly.

349
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,620
She likes to prevail over others.

350
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,340
She is not willing to
have dealings with us.

351
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,940
When she is in difficulty,

352
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
she won't tell us naturally.

353
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,340
That's because she doesn't
want you to belittle her.

354
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,060
She treated you so badly in the past.

355
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,820
But for me,

356
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,940
she is still a sister to us

357
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,740
though she had been acting
arbitrarily and imperiously

358
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,700
before we all got married.

359
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,940
When I heard that
her life is not going well.

360
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,300
I feel sad for her

361
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,060
from the bottom of my heart.

362
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,820
I will say nothing more.

363
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,740
The more I say,
the more worried I will be.

364
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,300
It is late now.

365
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
It's time for me to go back.

366
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,900
If not, my husband

367
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,340
will worry about me.

368
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,260
Please think carefully about

369
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,420
the matter I talked with you.

370
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,980
I got it, Wuniang.

371
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,060
Take care on your way back, sister.

372
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,540
Your Ladyship.

373
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Your monthly payment

374
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,660
are only 20 tael of silver.

375
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,420
How could you manage to pool 100 tael?

376
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,540
Lady Wuniang thinks that

377
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,260
you are really living a
wealthy life now.

378
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,500
Money is not the most important thing.

379
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
It is true that Wuniang came to me

380
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,580
because she is short of money.

381
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,860
But more importantly,

382
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,780
she wants to take advantage
of the Xu Family's reputation.

383
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,060
I'd better handle this matter prudently.

384
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,020
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

385
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,460
Yu'er really went too far.

386
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,820
How could he hit you in the face?

387
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,060
Your face is so pretty.

388
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
Don't blame him.

389
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,500
It is my fault.

390
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,620
Since his childhood,

391
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,140
I have been meeting all his needs

392
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,820
and pampering him.

393
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,020
But I know

394
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,980
he has a kind heart.

395
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,780
If he hadn't got drunk,

396
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,100
he would not have done
such a rude thing.

397
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,700
These are all my dowries.

398
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
This headdress

399
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,900
is made of the coral from the South Sea.

400
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,460
It is very precious.

401
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,060
This dangling head ornament

402
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
was bestowed on me by Her Majesty.

403
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,420
I value them a lot all along.

404
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,860
Now I want you to have them.

405
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,940
It is normal for a couple

406
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,940
to fight sometimes in a married life.

407
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,700
You need to be obedient to him

408
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,140
and say nice words to him.

409
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,140
I think if you do it,

410
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,180
he won't cause you so much trouble.

411
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,020
Now the most important thing
for you to do

412
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,860
is to bear our Wang Family
some offsprings.

413
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,060
As long as you can bear
him some children,

414
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,300
I will reward you handsomely.

415
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,660
Children?

416
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,460
I got it, Mother.

417
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,500
I am glad that you understand.

418
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,980
If you can bear him some children,

419
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,460
I think Yu'er

420
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,740
will quit

421
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,100
his monkey business.

422
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,660
Have a good rest to recuperate.

423
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,780
I am leaving.

424
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,300
How can such things compensate me?

425
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,660
I am not that cheap.

426
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,980
Children.

427
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,540
Who wants to bear him children?

428
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,060
Young Madam.

429
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,260
Nobody respects me as a human.

430
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,260
It is the Luo Family's fault.

431
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,180
It is Luo Shiyi's fault.

432
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,740
She pushed me into
the abyss of suffering.

433
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,300
Should it be put here, Mrs Zhou?

434
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,460
It is not good. It's not good.

435
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,940
Carry it here.

436
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,060
Dongqing.

437
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,540
Dongqing.

438
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,940
What business has brought you here?

439
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,420
Is there any order from Her Ladyship?

440
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Mrs Zhou, here is the thing.

441
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,340
Several days ago,

442
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,620
when Her Ladyship
went to the Xishan Villa,

443
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,260
she found some old fabrics

444
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,020
in the warehouse there.

445
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,500
She thought that those fabrics

446
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,500
would go to waste lying there.

447
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,820
It would be better

448
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,900
to donate them to the poor people.

449
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,540
It will be a good deed.

450
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,860
Her Ladyship is so kind.

451
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,020
But all the unused
fabrics in the mansion

452
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,060
are stored in the villa.

453
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,180
Is it proper to give them

454
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,700
to the poor people

455
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,740
without any gain?

456
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,460
Mrs Zhou, do you remember

457
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,380
whose abodes have these fabrics

458
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,340
been sent to?

459
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,020
If we obtain the relevant information,

460
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,860
we can avoid

461
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,740
such fabrics

462
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,820
when making donations.

463
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Please don't be hard on me.

464
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,540
It has been a long time.

465
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,420
How could I remember clearly?

466
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,900
Nevertheless,

467
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,740
records were created back then

468
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,540
about the storage of these fabrics.

469
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,860
If Her Ladyship wants to know,

470
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,980
she can go refer to the records.

471
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,100
Your Ladyship,

472
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,540
both the account book and the key

473
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,700
are in the hands of Concubine Qiao.

474
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,700
Only she can check the records.

475
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,260
Well, I am sure

476
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,060
Concubine Qiao won't show
us the records.

477
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,340
So we have to figure out another way.

478
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,500
Your Ladyship, but you

479
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,300
should take charge of

480
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,540
the household affairs of the
Xu Family in the first place.

481
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,500
Now she is in charge and our hands
are tied in everything.

482
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,740
It really makes me feel bad.

483
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,900
(Mansion of Xu)

484
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,700
Sister-in-law, I invited you
to my place today

485
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,780
to ask for a favor from you.

486
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,660
What can I do for you?

487
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,980
If there is anything
I can help you with,

488
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,460
don't hesitate to let me know.

489
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,100
Wuniang told me that

490
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,260
she wanted me to contribute some capital

491
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,620
to her dried fruit business.

492
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,460
It is an excellent idea.

493
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,020
But it came to my mind that

494
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,380
doing business would involve
money inevitably.

495
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,740
If something goes wrong,

496
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,860
the Marquis might be affected negatively.

497
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,460
On the other side, she is my sister.

498
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,540
If I don't help her and
cause her to hate me,

499
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,140
it will also be a great loss.

500
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,660
If I refuse her directly,

501
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,660
I am afraid that
she will feel humiliated.

502
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,700
So I want you

503
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,140
to mediate between us in this matter.

504
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,180
We have the same idea.

505
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,460
Wuniang also invited me.

506
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,740
It is a small business.

507
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,380
With so many persons involved,

508
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,860
there may be arguments in the future.

509
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
Well,

510
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,660
if she really wants to

511
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,740
start a dried fruit shop,

512
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,340
each of us might as well

513
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,580
invest fifty tael of silver.

514
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,700
Lending or giving,

515
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,540
we are doing her a favor.

516
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,820
That is a really good idea!

517
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,460
It's a deal.

518
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,220
I have some things I need to do today.

519
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,380
I'll be on my way.

520
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Take care.

521
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,020
We are spending

522
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,060
our savings.

523
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,580
Money goes in one hand
and out the other.

524
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,660
We can always be frugal.

525
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,060
After all, we will get
payment next month.

526
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,060
Wuniang has been nice to me.

527
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,540
I should help her

528
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
when I can.

529
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,700
Look at that!

530
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,460
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)
Your Ladyship.

531
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,180
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

532
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,100
It's so beautiful.

533
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
Zhun is coming.

534
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,420
Your Ladyship,

535
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,380
Zhun has been asking

536
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,820
to pay morning visit to Your Ladyship.

537
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,540
Good boy.

538
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,020
The weather is getting hot.

539
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,420
But your hands are still cold.

540
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,820
Come, let's go shuttlecock kicking.

541
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,500
I'm a boy.

542
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,180
I don't play this kind of game.

543
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,940
Well, perhaps you refuse
to play the game

544
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,820
only because you are not good at it.

545
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,740
What?

546
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,020
I'm so good at this game.

547
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
I don't buy it.

548
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,180
Would you mind competing with

549
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,140
Dongqing and Amber?

550
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,060
No problem.

551
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,220
I am not scared.

552
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,460
Let's go.

553
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,100
Let's go.

554
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,020
I won! I won!

555
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,940
Like I said, you are no match for me.

556
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,020
Amber,

557
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,460
it's your turn.

558
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,300
Zhun, please let me off.

559
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,780
I really don't know how
to kick the shuttlecock.

560
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,340
No way. I won't let you go

561
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,420
unless you play against me.

562
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,940
-Zhun.
-Just play with me.

563
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,820
Play with me.

564
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,060
Just for a while, please.

565
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,220
Zhun, I am really bad at this.

566
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,620
Just for a little while, okay?

567
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,860
Zhun.

568
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,100
Yu!

569
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,500
Come and join Zhun.

570
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,820
I'll get him here.

571
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,660
Dongqing will play with you, okay?

572
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,100
Come.

573
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,180
I just want you to play with me.

574
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,540
I'll try.

575
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,780
See?

576
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,260
You lost.

577
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,180
It seems you are having fun.

578
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,900
My Lord,

579
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,420
Zhun is having a shuttlecock match.

580
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,700
Dongqing and Amber

581
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,140
are no match for Zhun.

582
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,500
Only girls play shuttlecock.

583
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,860
Zhun should stay away from this game.

584
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,300
My Lord,

585
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,860
I beg to differ.

586
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Shuttlecock kicking

587
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,300
has been popular among kids
since Sui and Tang dynasties.

588
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,420
Zhun is born weak.

589
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,540
And practicing horse stance

590
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,260
is too boring for him.

591
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,900
It's a good thing that

592
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,580
he finds kicking shuttlecock interesting

593
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,220
and is willing to

594
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,780
exercise and build himself up.

595
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,660
This shuttlecock is light

596
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,060
and delicate.

597
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,340
Did you ask someone

598
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
to buy it?

599
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,220
My Lord, this shuttlecock

600
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,540
is invaluable.

601
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,660
It is made by Her Ladyship.

602
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,020
I can tell

603
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
that you spent a lot of time on it.

604
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,860
Thank you

605
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,100
for caring so much for Zhun.

606
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,180
I'll leave the capital on business

607
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,900
in a few days.

608
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,140
Knowing that Zhun

609
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,380
has been taken good care of by you

610
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,260
is a great comfort to me.

611
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,220
Nanny Tao,

612
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,460
take Zhun away.

613
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,540
Yes.

614
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,740
Zhun, let's get inside.

615
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,100
My Lord, is there anything wrong?

616
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,260
After several days of heavy rain,

617
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,180
there is raging flood water.

618
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,300
Many villages of surrounding counties

619
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,540
have been submerged.

620
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,260
People affected have lost their homes.

621
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,540
They begged all the way

622
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,060
to the capital.

623
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,500
The Ministry of Revenue
shall take care of the refugees.

624
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,580
Money is tight.

625
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,180
I will be held to account

626
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,660
if refugees become bandits

627
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,900
due to inefficient aid.

628
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,580
The weather is getting hot.

629
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,660
My Lord, you need
light clothes and water.

630
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,140
I've got it ready.

631
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,100
My Lord, what are you looking at?

632
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,700
I've never once seen you

633
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,620
using that brocade-feather fan
that I gave to you.

634
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,620
That fan is delicate

635
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
and rare.

636
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,660
It is a shame

637
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,260
to use it during normal days.

638
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,100
It is not a shame if you
make the most of it.

639
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
It seems

640
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,380
you are not being polite enough.

641
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,340
You did not even thank me

642
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,940
for giving you a gift.

643
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,580
Well,

644
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,500
I really don't know

645
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,900
how to thank His Lordship

646
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,700
for giving me such a precious gift.

647
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,020
His Lordship will leave the capital.

648
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,260
It's a long way away.

649
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,300
He will be trekking up hills
and crossing waters.

650
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,540
Your Ladyship,

651
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,340
you might make a pair of shoes

652
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,060
for His Lordship.

653
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,220
That sounds nice.

654
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,620
The Yellow River flooded.

655
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,220
The city is full of refugees.

656
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,820
Lingyi plans to

657
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,420
cooperate with high-ranking
officials in the capital

658
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,020
to set up soup kitchens

659
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,060
to provide the refugees in the capital

660
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,180
with porridge.

661
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,620
They are doing something good.

662
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,700
Hid Lordship is benevolent.

663
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,300
It is supreme goodness

664
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,940
to tide people affected over.

665
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,420
You've been running
the household affairs

666
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,060
for a while.

667
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,300
You are very considerate and reliable.

668
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,580
I want to trust you

669
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,660
with the disaster relief.

670
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
Great Madam...

671
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,940
Lingyi keeps people in his heart.

672
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,940
He will appreciate you

673
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,580
handling the issue well.

674
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,180
Great Madam, thank you for trusting me.

675
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,020
I will handle the whole thing

676
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,620
appropriately.

677
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,580
I will never bring shame
to the Xu Family,

678
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,860
to Great Madam and His Lordship.

679
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,060
Sure.

680
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,180
My Lord.

681
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,340
It's so late. What brings you here?

682
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,940
My Lord, you will be
travelling a long way.

683
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,460
I made this pair of shoes for you,

684
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,900
in case you need it.

685
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,660
I've heard that you're a
marvelous embroiderer.

686
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,340
Well, it seems there is nothing special

687
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,180
about your embroidery.

688
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,860
The stitches are not well aligned.

689
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,060
The bottoms are too thick.

690
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,700
Well, should I take it back

691
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,580
and rework it?

692
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,220
I don't think so.

693
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,460
The shoes are not elaborate.

694
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,780
But they look nice.

695
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,220
That doesn't work.

696
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,860
I should make adjustments to it.

697
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,820
I don't want you to wear
uncomfortable shoes.

698
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,220
It is a gift from you.

699
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,700
I will accept it anyway.

700
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,460
I'll try them on.

701
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,900
New shoes are tight.

702
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,780
Let me help you.

703
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,220
There you go.

704
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,460
Okay.

705
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,340
Do the shoes fit, My Lord?

706
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:11,740
Perfect.

707
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,740
Zhaoying.

708
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,020
At your service, My Lord.

709
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,300
Where are my shoes?

710
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,340
They are right under your feet.

711
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,780
I mean that pair of shoes.

712
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,660
Which pair?

713
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,300
The pair made by Shiyi.

714
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,100
Which pair

715
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,660
made by Her Ladyship?

716
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,700
Alright, My Lord.

717
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,580
I might as well change
another pair of shoes.

718
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,220
What's wrong with the new one?

719
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,140
My Lord,

720
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,180
why do you need to change shoes?

721
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,460
You talk too much.

722
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:35,980
Wrap it up.

723
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,220
It turns out that you

724
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,860
don't want to get new shoes dirty.

725
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,860
Scouts in the Western Region are rare.

726
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,820
(Account Book)

727
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,380
How did it go?

728
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,580
Madam, the soup kitchen has been built.

729
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,980
The service has begun.

730
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,620
I have never seen a line

731
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,900
that long.

732
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,900
The refugees say all the good things

733
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,620
about Xu Family.

734
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,300
Great Madam has trusted me

735
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,940
with this.

736
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,020
I am set to do it right.

737
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,300
I cannot afford to make any mistake.

738
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,980
This way,

739
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,380
we will be confident in front of Shiyi.

740
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,620
Madam, you are right.

741
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,820
Please rest assured

742
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
I will do the whole thing right.

743
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,420
Sure.

744
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,900
Qiuhong,

745
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,020
tell me,

746
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,700
which one looks better?

747
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,700
Well, in my opinion,

748
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,060
they both look nice.

749
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,660
I regret even to ask you the question.

750
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,060
You don't get it.

751
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,860
I think

752
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,100
this one looks better.

753
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,700
Madam, Young Madam Wen is here.

754
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,220
She is here?

755
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,100
What brings you here today?

756
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,660
You have no idea?

757
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,380
What happened?

758
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,540
Xu Family now purchases silk

759
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,940
from Zhang Family.

760
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,100
It's...

761
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,020
We've been

762
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,020
purchasing silk

763
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,820
from Wen Family

764
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,020
all these years.

765
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,620
What happened?

766
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,980
Are you aware

767
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,900
that Madam Zhang

768
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,020
has been close to Qiao Family?

769
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,180
You mean,

770
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,140
Concubine Qiao is behind this?

771
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,940
Now, merchants

772
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,460
who do business with Xu and Wen Families

773
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,820
start to doubt

774
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,700
if Wen Family has lost the
support of Xu Family.

775
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,820
Many of them start to do business

776
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,380
with Zhang Family.

777
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,420
It's a big loss to us.

778
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,740
It is really serious.

779
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,900
Your brother said

780
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,700
he might not be able

781
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,220
to pay you monthly dividend

782
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,940
if the problem remained unsolved.

783
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,100
Dear,

784
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,340
you need to figure out what to do.

785
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,100
Calm down.

786
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
I'll have to give the matter
a little thought.

787
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,620
It will take some time

788
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,980
to figure it out.

789
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,860
Dear,

790
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,220
a word of caution.

791
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,340
The Marquis got a new wife.

792
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,060
He might be too busy to
take care of you.

793
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,060
You will need to rely on Wen Family

794
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,540
if you want to live a safe life

795
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,740
with your son Yu.

796
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
I understand what you said.

797
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,780
But...

798
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,460
There is no but.

799
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,420
We are counting on you.

800
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,460
I should go.

801
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,460
We are still looking for a way

802
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,100
to get rid of the unsold inventory.

803
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,180
It turns out that Concubine Qiao

804
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,180
is a callous woman.

805
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,180
It seems

806
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,860
hard days lie ahead.

807
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,460
Perhaps you have no choice

808
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,620
but to ask Concubine Qiao for a favor.

809
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,980
The time has come

810
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,460
when I have to put my pride aside.

811
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,420
I've heard

812
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,300
about your charm and gracious living.

813
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,260
Today,

814
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,140
(Account Book)

815
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,180
I get to see it.

816
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,100
You are gracious, as a legitimate
daughter of a prestigious family.

817
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,100
As you know,

818
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,420
I come from a merchant family.

819
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,060
I didn't see much about the world.

820
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,100
If I ever said anything

821
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,860
that offended you,

822
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,580
I never meant it.

823
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,180
Please

824
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,340
forgive me.

825
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,580
It's no surprise that the daughter of
a merchant family is bad-mannered.

826
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,260
Surely, I will not

827
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,660
sink to your level.

828
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,420
This Jade Ruyi
[*means as you wish]

829
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,500
looks good

830
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,580
in your room.

831
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,340
This is made of Lantian jade.

832
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,500
It is hard

833
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,260
to find such a pure jade.

834
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,300
It simply looks perfect

835
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,460
for this room.

836
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,220
Rare as it is,

837
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,500
my family is not short of

838
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,580
invaluable jade articles.

839
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820
You are welcome

840
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,060
to take it back.

841
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,820
You come from a wealthy family.

842
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,300
It's no surprise

843
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,420
that these things don't appeal to you.

844
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,060
But this Jade Ruyi

845
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,140
is a gift for you.

846
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,420
I'm not a jade connoisseur.

847
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,060
It would be a shame

848
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,540
for me to have it.

849
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,900
Please take it.

850
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
In that case,

851
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,180
I should

852
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,700
return the favor.

853
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,540
Xiuyuan,

854
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,460
take out the brocade

855
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,980
that I just received.

856
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,860
It's my gift to you.

857
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,700
The brocade

858
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,380
is so smooth and delicate.

859
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,100
You don't have to do that.

860
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,620
This is from the brocade shop

861
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,460
of Zhang Family.

862
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,340
They produce

863
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,820
top-level brocades,

864
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,900
with which those unestablished brands

865
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,460
can never compared.

866
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,060
Now I'm in charge of the
household affairs.

867
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,940
I cannot allow my family

868
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,180
to wear those vulgar and

869
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,500
ridiculous clothes.

870
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,020
Don't you think so?

871
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,180
That's right.

872
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,500
I'm tired.

873
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,540
Xiuyuan, send her out.

874
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,100
Madam, please.

875
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,980
Have a good rest.

876
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,780
I should be on my way.

877
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,100
In the past, I would never
have tolerated

878
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,540
her impoliteness.

879
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,620
Madam, calm down.

880
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,380
We are at the end

881
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,740
of our rope.

882
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,260
We are living under her roof.

883
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,620
We need to obey her rules.

884
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,100
Concubine Qiao

885
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,780
now holds dominion

886
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,940
over the business of Wen Family.

887
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,180
You should focus on the big picture.

888
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,420
By the way, your money

889
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,820
can last you the whole life.

890
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,980
As far as I'm concerned,

891
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,780
you're putting yourself

892
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,300
in a dilemma,

893
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,580
feeling miserable.

894
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,060
You might as well play dumb

895
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,460
and breeze through life.

896
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,780
In this world,

897
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,620
no one can breeze through life.

898
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,940
I wish I could.

899
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,460
I guess I'm not that lucky.

900
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,260
In the Xu Family,

901
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,380
wives and maids

902
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,340
respect me

903
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,980
only because of my money.

904
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,940
Without the support of Wen Family,

905
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,500
there is no flow of capital.

906
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,300
The money stays in the account.

907
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,580
We'll be depleting all the money.

908
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,380
It can sustain us only a few years.

909
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,980
With the support of Wen Family,

910
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,820
there is flow of capital.

911
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,380
Money will be making money.

912
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,500
It is our golden goose.

913
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,740
If I stay out of the business
of Wen Family,

914
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,140
if I don't rely on Wen Family,

915
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,860
can I

916
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,420
count on His Lordship?

917
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,660
His Lordship is not a callous man.

918
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,180
I don't see any reason

919
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,820
why you can't count on His Lordship.

920
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,620
We have been

921
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,380
estranged for a long time.

922
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,300
Madam...

923
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,860
As for the future,

924
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,180
I don't care much about myself.

925
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,980
But I have a son.

926
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,620
So,

927
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,860
no matter how difficult
the future may be,

928
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,060
I will carry on.

929
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,420
(Nature of Jade and Gold)

930
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,420
(Nature of Jade and Gold)
Broaden the minds.

931
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,540
Bring benefits to the people.

932
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,500
Carry forward the great
knowledge of the sages.

933
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,660
Bring peace to the world
for generations to come.

934
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,180
Yu, what are you reading?

935
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,860
You look so absorbed.

936
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,580
Mother,

937
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,660
I am reading the Hengqu
Sayings of Zhang Zai,

938
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,820
a great master of the
Northern Song dynasty.

939
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,300
Really?

940
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,420
Well, tell me

941
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,180
what these sayings are about?

942
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,220
They are about the truths of study.

943
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,820
That we are expected to
read books of the sages

944
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,540
in order to build

945
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,700
a vibrant society,

946
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,300
show the way for the people,

947
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,660
carry forward the knowledge
of saints like Confucius and Mencius,

948
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,180
and lay the foundation of
sustainable peace

949
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,380
for generations to come.

950
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,580
Well,

951
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,020
it sounds a load of hocus-pocus.

952
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,940
That's absurd.

953
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,700
Why make it sound so deep?

954
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,620
Mother, you can understand the meaning?

955
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,620
Of course I can.

956
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,380
It says

957
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,500
that you should study hard,

958
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,620
make a name through the examinations

959
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,100
and become successful.

960
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,620
Then, we can live a safe life

961
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,700
even after we leave Xu Family.

962
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,380
Master Zhang

963
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,340
didn't mean that at all...

964
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,420
(Le or Yue)
[*fourth tone, means music or happiness]

965
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,140
It will be a great relief to me

966
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,180
if you get scholarly honor
and official rank.

967
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,540
Concubine Qiao is

968
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,020
very pretentious.

969
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,020
She would love to put up a front

970
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,780
with calligraphy and paintings.

971
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,300
I know what to do.

972
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,260
Mother, what are you saying?

973
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,580
What calligraphy and painting?

974
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,340
(Mansion of Xu)
The devastation is sweeping.

975
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,180
The thought of

976
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,180
poor refugees

977
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,900
keeps me awake at night.

978
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,140
It would be nice

979
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,780
if I could visit Ci'an Temple

980
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,420
with Great Madam and Second Madam.

981
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,980
I heard that you've been
serving porridge

982
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,060
at the soup kitchen these days.

983
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,860
You've done a lot.

984
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,260
I'm sure the refugees could feel

985
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,540
your benevolence.

986
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,180
The soup kitchen is
currently our top priority.

987
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,300
Therefore,

988
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,820
you must do it right.

989
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,180
That is what is expected of you.

990
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,460
Do remember one thing:

991
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,020
you should be very careful.

992
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,740
Great Madam, you may rest assured

993
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,980
that I will do as you say.

994
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,340
Bear that in mind.

995
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,100
