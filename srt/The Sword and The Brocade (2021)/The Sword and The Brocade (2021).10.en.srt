=Episode 10=

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
You're working so meticulously

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,440
on the embroidery items for us.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm afraid it's not only for the purpose

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,720
of making fan embroidery designs, right?

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,800
Since you're here,

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,160
try my new tea.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Since you've married into the Xu family,

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
we're family now.

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,839
If you need any help

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,320
in the future,

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
just tell me.

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
Thank you, Yizhen.

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
I've heard

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
that you're going to Ci'an Temple soon

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
to light incense and pray.

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm just accompanying Danyang there.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,320
I've heard that many people pray
at Ci'an Temple.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,640
It's very efficacious.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,440
I hope it can help her

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,800
give birth safely.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,760
If you're interested,

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,280
you can come with us.

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,760
What I said earlier was a bit rude.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,680
To be honest,

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,680
my mother's death

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,520
is very painful for me.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
When she was killed that day,

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,760
I heard that the female members
of the family

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,360
were all in Ci'an Temple.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
May I ask

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,560
if you've seen anyone suspicious?

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,080
That day,

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,400
I've always stayed by mother's side.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,720
I didn't see anything
out of the ordinary.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,760
The deceased is gone, the living
must move on with their lives.

54
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
You're still young.

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,840
Don't hold on to the past.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,760
You must seize the present.

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,080
Thank you for your concern.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
All right.

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Did Second Madam

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,120
notice anything?

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,119
I heard that
the Second son of Xu family, Xu Ling'an,

62
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,240
was clever and skilled
in military strategies.

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
He should be the head of this household.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,040
Yizhen was able
to marry him,

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
so she should be
someone important as well.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,200
I was careless.

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
Fortunately,

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,960
it seems she doesn't have
any bad intentions.

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
However, we've almost seen
all the embroidery items

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,680
of the female family members.

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,040
We still didn't find any clues.

72
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,000
In that case, we can only come up
with another plan.

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,080
Dongqing.

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,400
Let's pick a few flowers

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
and put them in a vase.

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,600
It will be nice if we place them
in the room.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Dongqing, that one.
That one's beautiful.

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,960
All right.

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,240
Your Ladyship, I can't reach it.

80
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,800
My Lord.

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
Thank you, My Lord.

82
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,400
It's fine. It's nothing.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
I heard that you've been busy

84
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
making embroidery designs
for everyone's fans.

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
You've been working hard.

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
I have nothing to do anyway.

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,480
So I thought about doing some needlework

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
and putting in some effort for everyone.

89
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,160
Since you just married

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,840
into the Xu family,

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
you're not familiar
with the household affairs yet.

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
That's why Concubine Qiao is managing
the household affairs for you.

93
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,120
You're the Xu family's matron.

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
You want me to manage
the household affairs?

95
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,520
Managing the household affairs
is the matron's responsibility.

96
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,640
Your Ladyship.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
What did His Lordship mean?

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
Perhaps he wants me

99
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,280
to become familiar with the family's
household affairs

100
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
and manage the household affairs.

101
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,760
I originally thought

102
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,200
that His Lordship will be
like Great Madam

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,400
and favor Concubine Qiao.

104
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,200
I didn't expect

105
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,720
that he's quite fair.

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,320
You're so clumsy.

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,240
Those are Sichuan brocades given
by His Majesty.

108
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,640
If something happens to them,

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,040
I'll skin you alive.

110
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,600
Categorize them by color and class.

111
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,320
Tomorrow, based on the portions,

112
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,240
deliver them to each court.

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,880
Yes, Mrs. Zhou.

114
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,440
Greetings, Mother.

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,760
Sit down.

116
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,160
In the past few days, I heard

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,280
that Lingyi has been sleeping
at Banyuepan.

118
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,760
Don't forget

119
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,320
your own duties.

120
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,640
Take good care of Lingyi.

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
You don't need

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,640
to come here and greet me daily.

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
Yes, Mother.

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Your Ladyship.

125
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,360
I wonder how the embroidery designs

126
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
for the fans are going?

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Don't tire yourself out

128
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
just because of it.

129
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,800
Mother.

130
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,520
I actually want to talk to you
about this matter.

131
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,480
I've seen the embroidery items
of each concubine.

132
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,680
They're extraordinary.

133
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,640
I won't embarrass myself.

134
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
That makes sense.

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,720
That should be done by the servants.

136
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,440
In that case,

137
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,320
find some embroiderers

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,760
who are skillful.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
Great Madam.

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Before I got married,

141
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,080
I always hired an embroiderer
with surname of Jiang.

142
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,120
She has magnificent embroidery skills.

143
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,880
She's famous in the capital.

144
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
We can let her

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,160
handle this matter.

146
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,560
I'll let you take care of it then.

147
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,080
Yes, Great Madam.

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
You should really let them

149
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,400
see your embroidery technique.

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,120
I don't know what Concubine Qiao

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
is so pleased about.

152
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,960
Don't forget

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,400
what we came here for.

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
Why should we compete with them?

155
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,080
Even if Luo Shiyi

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,240
is the legal wife,

157
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,600
she's not good enough at all.

158
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,600
You just pulled some tricks,

159
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,040
and she backed off.

160
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
The wise submits to the circumstances.

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,640
She knows her capabilities well.

162
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,200
I've been managing the Xu household
for so long.

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,440
How can she easily affect my position?

164
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,920
You may be managing
the household affairs now,

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,360
but you don't have the official title.

166
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,640
In the future,

167
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,600
if she establishes herself
in the future,

168
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,360
she'll still become a problem.

169
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,920
What if

170
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,520
while you still have the authority,

171
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,160
push your advantage?

172
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,920
What do you have in mind, Mrs. Zhang?

173
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
Second Madam doesn't have any intentions
of managing household affairs.

174
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Fifth Madam disdains managing
household affairs.

175
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
Only that illegitimate daughter

176
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,960
can compete with you.

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,720
So, from the start,

178
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,759
some things must be set up.

179
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,920
Here.

180
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,760
These are the osmanthus puff pastry
that Concubine Qiao made.

181
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,520
She told me to bring them
for you to taste.

182
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,800
She remembers me?

183
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,280
Concubine Qiao is so nice.

184
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
I won't be shy then.

185
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,400
I've heard

186
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,400
that the Sichuan brocades
are the best ones this time around.

187
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,560
After they get to Concubine Qiao,

188
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,640
I wonder

189
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,400
what will be left.

190
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,440
It's delicious.

191
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,160
Mrs. Zhou.

192
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,000
Tell me, for a long time,

193
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,000
Concubine Qiao

194
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,720
has been managing
all the household affairs.

195
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
Even if she's not given any credits,

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,440
she puts in a lot of effort, right?

197
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,440
Right.

198
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,480
But once Her Ladyship married
into the family,

199
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,800
Concubine Qiao isn't included

200
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560
on anything good anymore.

201
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,760
I feel so bad for Concubine Qiao.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,520
You're right.

203
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,760
How can ordinary people

204
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,920
compare to Concubine Qiao
in terms of the background?

205
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,000
Besides, Concubine Qiao

206
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,320
has a kind heart.

207
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,640
Everyone in the family

208
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,200
only has good things to say about her.

209
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,560
I heard that His Lordship

210
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,720
hasn't visited

211
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,360
Her Ladyship for a while.

212
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,800
She just married into the family.

213
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,960
But Concubine Qiao

214
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,320
is favored by Great Madam.

215
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,680
Her good days are yet to come.

216
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,360
Regarding the Sichuan brocades...

217
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,720
Tell Concubine Qiao

218
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
that I

219
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,160
will take care of that.

220
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,400
Here.

221
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,480
Let me see.

222
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,480
Your Ladyship.

223
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,360
Your Ladyship.

224
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,080
Nanny Tao.

225
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,440
What are these?

226
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,040
Sichuan brocade from His Majesty.

227
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,040
Mrs. Zhou sent people
to bring them over just now.

228
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,800
Sichuan brocade?

229
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,240
Let me see.

230
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,040
This... This isn't right.

231
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,040
I've been in the mansion
for so many years.

232
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,400
I've never seen anyone

233
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
who dared to bring items
with this kind of quality

234
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
to the legal wife's court.

235
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,800
This isn't Her Ladyship's portion.

236
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
This isn't Her Ladyship's portion?

237
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,040
Nice, Your Ladyship.

238
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,680
His Lordship just hasn't been here
for a few days,

239
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,640
and they're already

240
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
bullying us.

241
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,280
This matter

242
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,560
concerns your status and position.

243
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,520
We can't make the slightest concessions
about this matter.

244
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,240
I must go to Mrs. Zhou

245
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,960
and see what she's up to.

246
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,680
Nanny Tao.

247
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,920
Don't go.

248
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,280
We don't need to argue with people

249
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
about such trivial matters.

250
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,400
Your Ladyship, you're unaware.

251
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,680
These people

252
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
have always bullied the weak
and feared the strong.

253
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,960
If you make concessions
for the first time,

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,520
then...

255
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,680
They'll think

256
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,160
that they can bully us.

257
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,760
Besides,

258
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,600
status is the order followed by ethics
and moral principles.

259
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,520
How can we let them

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,080
act so impetuously?

261
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,600
I must go to find her.

262
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,280
Your Ladyship.

263
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,520
I think Nanny Tao is right.

264
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,840
We must let them know

265
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,400
that we can't be bullied.

266
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,800
You think those servants

267
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
are that bold?

268
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,600
They're just following instructions.

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,120
Could it be Great Madam?

270
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,200
Great Madam won't worry

271
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,520
about these trivial things.

272
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,440
Now, the one who manages
the household affairs

273
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,160
is Concubine Qiao.

274
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
Concubine Qiao?

275
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
If it's her,

276
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,160
we should make a fuss all the more.

277
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,240
She's so two-faced.

278
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,080
She's a legitimate daughter
of a prominent family.

279
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,840
Now, she's a concubine.

280
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,160
She's pitiful too.

281
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Besides, I don't care
about these things.

282
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,760
Let her be.

283
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,680
Your Ladyship.

284
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,800
That's enough.

285
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,160
What a coincidence.

286
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,160
I don't need to go
and look for you anymore.

287
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,040
Nanny Tao, what can I do for you?

288
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,120
What can you do for me?

289
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,160
Don't you know?

290
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,920
Give me Her Ladyship's Sichuan brocades.

291
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Si... Sichuan brocades?

292
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,880
Didn't I already

293
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,400
ask people to send them to you?

294
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,080
What is the quality
of the items you sent?

295
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm just following the rules.

296
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,880
If you think

297
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,080
that I did something wrong,

298
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,120
complain about me to the one
managing the household affairs.

299
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,400
Complain about you to Concubine Qiao?

300
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,600
You think I'm stupid?

301
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,520
You've been colluding together!

302
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,680
You're so funny.

303
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,080
In relying on a concubine,

304
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,080
you're fighting against the legal wife?

305
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,120
I think

306
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
you're a stupid fool!

307
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,920
Who are you calling names?

308
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,880
You.

309
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,240
Let me tell you.

310
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
Some people

311
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,560
just seem favored on the surface.

312
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
Who isn't aware?

313
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,680
Perhaps someday,
someone will lose favor.

314
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,080
Who will lose favor?

315
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Today...

316
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,560
Today, I'll let you lose favor first!

317
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,680
Stop!

318
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,640
Madam.

319
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,520
You must seek justice for me.

320
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,480
This woman

321
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,920
hit me

322
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,120
indiscriminately.

323
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,920
Look... Look at what she did.

324
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,800
Look.

325
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,240
The offender is complaining first.

326
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,360
Don't you know

327
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,680
what you did yourself?

328
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,640
Goodness.

329
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
If everyone can hit people

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
thinking that they have a good reason,

331
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,120
won't the world fall into chaos?

332
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,600
Who did it first?

333
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040
Her. It was her!

334
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,360
Everyone saw it.

335
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,360
I haven't even started.

336
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,200
Gathering a crowd to make disturbances
and creating troubles.

337
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,360
You should be punished according
to the house rules.

338
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,440
Come.

339
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,560
Flog Nanny Tao 20 times.

340
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,840
Wait.

341
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,200
Let's go.

342
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,400
You... You're just

343
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,320
aiming at me.

344
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,200
You're using your authority
to take revenge for personal grudges.

345
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
You think

346
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,280
others will be convinced about you then?

347
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,880
You... You can't compare

348
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,720
to Her Ladyship at all!

349
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Don't think that you're the one managing
household affairs now.

350
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,160
It won't last long!

351
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,160
If Her Ladyships wants the authority
to manage household affairs,

352
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,760
she can come to me.

353
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,560
Why should a crazy woman like you

354
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,760
say that here?

355
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,480
You're arrogant and insubordinate.

356
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,640
Flog her ten more times!

357
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,560
Flog her!

358
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,280
You...

359
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,080
Stop.

360
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Your Ladyship.

361
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,320
Nanny Tao hit her first.

362
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,320
Since I saw them,

363
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,640
if I ignore it,

364
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,040
and His Lordship finds out,

365
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,480
won't he blame me for not being strict
with my management of household affairs?

366
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,360
Not being strict with your management
of household affairs?

367
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
Is that why you're managing me

368
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,440
as well?

369
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,680
I'm just punishing an old servant

370
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,840
who doesn't know her place.

371
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,760
Your Ladyship.

372
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
Why are you blaming

373
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,080
such a big offense on me?

374
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,960
Dongqing, Amber.

375
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,640
Help Nanny Tao up.

376
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,600
-Yes.
-Yes.

377
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,600
If Nanny Tao made a mistake,

378
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,240
you could report it
to Western Lateral Court.

379
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
I'll discipline and punish her.

380
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,600
But you

381
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,720
didn't even inform me

382
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,240
and you're punishing her on your own.

383
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm afraid you're not respecting me

384
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
as the matron at all.

385
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,200
I don't dare to do that.

386
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,160
It's just that Great Madam

387
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,160
told me to manage the household affairs.

388
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,240
Speaking of which, I remember

389
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,200
that Nanny Tao is taking care of Zhun.

390
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,000
And Zhun lives

391
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,320
with Great Madam.

392
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,280
In that case,

393
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,320
Nanny Tao is considered

394
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,840
as half a member of the Fushou Court.

395
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
You didn't inform me

396
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,800
or Great Madam at all

397
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,800
and punished her in private.

398
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
What's your intention?

399
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,320
I was rash.

400
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,199
Regarding the Sichuan brocade,

401
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Mrs. Zhou

402
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
sent the portion for the legal wife

403
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,679
to Concubine Qiao,

404
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,439
and sent the concubine's portion

405
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,919
to Her Ladyship.

406
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,720
Of course Nanny Tao

407
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,199
couldn't accept it.

408
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
So the two of them had a fight.

409
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,400
What do you think about this matter?

410
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Well...

411
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,160
Well what?

412
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
You've been with me for dozens of years.

413
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,680
What can you not say to me?

414
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,680
Forgive me for being blunt.

415
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,400
There's an order

416
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,800
for every wife's portions.

417
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,640
If they just do
whatever they want this way,

418
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,400
won't that create chaos then?

419
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,360
Lianfang

420
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,000
is too impatient.

421
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
Yes.

422
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
Lianfang.

423
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,800
Shiyi just married into the family.

424
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,640
She's not very familiar

425
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,320
with the household affairs yet.

426
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,280
You must assist her.

427
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Yes, Great Madam.

428
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
I'll remember that.

429
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,000
Two days ago, I heard

430
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,640
that there was a big fuss

431
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,480
regarding the Sichuan brocade.

432
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,560
Those two women

433
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,720
made the atmosphere
here at home so foul.

434
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,480
How inappropriate.

435
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,280
It's my fault.

436
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,400
I didn't make it clear before.

437
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,840
I saw that the peony pattern

438
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,840
suits Lianfang,

439
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,440
so I made a decision

440
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,040
to give her that piece
of Sichuan brocade.

441
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,040
I didn't expect

442
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,160
that it would create a mess.

443
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,800
Nanny Tao

444
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,680
has served Yuanniang for so many years.

445
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
She has always been honest, dutiful,

446
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,040
and obedient to the rules.

447
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,640
She never committed any mistakes.

448
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,480
Why did

449
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,040
she suddenly change?

450
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,880
I can't believe she even hit someone.

451
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,200
Mother.

452
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,320
I didn't discipline my servant well.

453
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,480
I'll surely do that when I get back.

454
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,520
All right.

455
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,960
This is the end of that matter.

456
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,840
It can't happen again.

457
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Mother.

458
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,560
You're too kind.

459
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,800
You're tolerating their impetuousness,

460
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,600
especially Mrs. Zhou.

461
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,560
What do you mean?

462
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,600
Nanny Tao is a senior servant

463
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,280
who served Yuanniang before.

464
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,960
Even if she was inappropriate this time,

465
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,360
she did it to seek justice

466
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,640
for the one she serves.

467
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,520
But who is Mrs. Zhou?

468
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
It would be fine if she just explained
what happened.

469
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,480
I wonder

470
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,880
who she's relying on

471
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,720
to dare to act so impetuously.

472
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
I can't believe she had a fight
with Nanny Tao.

473
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,160
I think she should be flogged

474
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,880
to make her remember this incident well.

475
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,720
Forget it.

476
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,200
She's old.

477
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,440
This is what we'll do.

478
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,160
Deduct two months of her salary.

479
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
That's all.

480
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,840
Madam.

481
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,240
Danyang.

482
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,560
Have you always been this way
these days?

483
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,440
Did you consult a physician?

484
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,560
Great Madam.

485
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Madam

486
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,560
has been vomiting a lot
in a recent couple of days.

487
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,080
The physician prescribed some medicines,

488
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,320
but she didn't feel better.

489
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm so worried.

490
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,560
I told you already.

491
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,600
During this period of time,

492
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,120
stop coming to greet me.

493
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,160
There's no need to do this.

494
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,760
Look at you.

495
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,320
Mother, don't worry.

496
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,760
Yizhen and I already agreed

497
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,400
to light an incense
and pray at Ci'an Temple.

498
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,400
Actually,

499
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,160
Yizhen is so kind to
remind me about it.

500
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,920
When I first got pregnant,

501
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,400
I kept vomiting nonstop.

502
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,520
After I came back from lighting incense
at Ci'an Temple,

503
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,800
I felt much better.

504
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,880
Hurry then.

505
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,720
Ask more servants to go with you.

506
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,280
Leave early, and return soon.

507
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,520
Your Ladyship.

508
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,760
Great Madam is favoring

509
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,040
Concubine Qiao too much.

510
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,520
In order to protect Concubine Qiao,

511
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,160
she's even disregarding statuses.

512
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,200
What will the people here

513
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,280
think about you then?

514
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,800
I'm so furious.

515
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,280
Your Ladyship.

516
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,240
This time, Concubine Qiao

517
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,960
gained the upper hand by relying
on Great Madam.

518
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,800
If you still won't do anything,

519
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
I'm afraid that it will be harder

520
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,480
to suppress her in the future.

521
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,200
It's all my fault.

522
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,280
I originally wanted
to teach her a lesson.

523
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,600
I didn't expect

524
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,560
that it even made her more arrogant.

525
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,400
What should we do, Your Ladyship?

526
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,520
Nanny Tao, don't blame yourself.

527
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,280
You all don't need to be
too worried either.

528
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,080
Gaining or losing advantage

529
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,520
isn't important to me.

530
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,400
You don't need to mind it too much.

531
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,840
Your Ladyship, how can you

532
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,440
not mind it?

533
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
Back then, the Luo family spent
so much effort

534
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,720
to let you marry into the Xu family.

535
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,240
Why is that?

536
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,760
Have you forgotten?

537
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,280
Now,

538
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,480
if you can't even win

539
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,680
against a concubine,

540
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,800
then...

541
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,480
then what will happen to Zhun?

542
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,280
Nanny Tao, don't worry.

543
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,720
I know what to do.

544
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,440
Today, Shiyi and Lianfang

545
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,960
were lectured by Great Madam.

546
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,160
What happened?

547
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,480
I heard

548
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,040
that Concubine Qiao took the portion
of Sichuan brocade

549
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,480
that was supposed to be Her Ladyship's.

550
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,280
However,

551
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,960
it seems like Great Madam permitted it.

552
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
But Nanny Tao hit Mrs. Zhou

553
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
because of this matter.

554
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,880
She hit her?

555
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
Many people in the household saw it.

556
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,200
Clothing made from Sichuan brocade

557
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,480
is so nice.

558
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,040
Only you

559
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,680
deserve to wear this peony design.

560
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,920
I hired the best tailor in the city

561
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,720
to make this clothing for me.

562
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,200
Only his skill

563
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,840
deserves this Sichuan brocade
given by His Majesty.

564
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,600
Tell me.

565
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,000
Will His Lordship like it?

566
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,560
Even if fairies come down from heaven,

567
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
you'll defeat them.

568
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,240
His Lordship will surely like it.

569
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,920
This time,

570
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,840
he won't reject me again, right?

571
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,320
My Lord, Concubine Qiao is here.

572
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,360
Let her in.

573
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,120
Yes.

574
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,960
My Lord.

575
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,280
You've always been busy with work.

576
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm afraid
that you'll tire yourself out,

577
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,080
so I especially made
the tonic soup for you.

578
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,240
My Lord.

579
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,320
Drink it while it's hot.

580
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
Have you ever heard
of the five poisons?

581
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Ancient men called

582
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,640
desire, anger, ignorance, pride and envy

583
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
the five poisons.

584
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,360
Why are you mentioning that?

585
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,720
There are five poisons in the heart.

586
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,080
If you have too many desires,

587
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,800
you'll covet things

588
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,400
that don't belong to you.

589
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,080
From now on,

590
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,240
don't wear this clothing again.

591
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,360
My Lord, you are right.

592
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,800
I'll get changed when I am back.

593
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,320
Don't let it happen again.

594
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Yes.

595
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,800
Madam, what are you doing?

596
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,160
Madam, don't act this way.

597
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,400
You'll get hurt.

598
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,720
Madam.

599
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,640
Not only won't this help,

600
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,520
if news about this spreads

601
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,960
and His Lordship finds out,

602
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,720
he'll only be angrier at you.

603
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,000
For...

604
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,200
For his sake,

605
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
I let go of my dignity and pride

606
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,360
to please him.

607
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,960
But he...

608
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,400
Why won't he

609
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,120
accept me?

610
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I just want him to know

611
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,880
that I

612
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,960
am the one most suitable

613
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,040
to wear this clothing.

614
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,760
I'm the one most suitable

615
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,560
to stand beside him.

616
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,480
Yet he

617
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,760
used the five poisons to warn me.

618
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,280
What exactly did I do wrong?

619
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,560
Madam, you weren't wrong.

620
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,280
You didn't do anything wrong.

621
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,880
It's the fault of the Luo family's
illegitimate daughter.

622
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
She took your position.

623
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,240
You're right.

624
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,520
If I

625
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,320
am the legal wife,

626
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,640
His Lordship won't slight me.

627
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,440
So I

628
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,760
must

629
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,480
surely become the legal wife.

630
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,360
Your Ladyship, His Lordship is here.

631
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,400
My Lord.

632
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,120
Why are you here so late at night?

633
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,560
I can't come here for no reason?

634
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,840
My Lord, have some tea.

635
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,600
Today, I heard about what happened
with the Sichuan brocade.

636
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,000
As the legal wife,

637
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,920
you must have the prestige of a matron.

638
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,120
You can't let the servants fool you.

639
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,520
I just married into the family.

640
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,520
I don't know how to use someone else's
power to throw my weight around.

641
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,560
But don't worry.

642
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,840
As long as others don't create trouble,

643
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,840
such incidents

644
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,040
won't happen again.

645
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
If you use

646
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,480
your sharp tongue towards me

647
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,720
to face others,

648
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,720
you won't get bullied.

649
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
After a couple of days,

650
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,520
according to the imperial edict,

651
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,000
I must go hunting with His Majesty.

652
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,080
You better behave yourself.

653
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,480
Don't cause more troubles.

654
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,520
Cause troubles?

655
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,080
May I ask what I did wrong?

656
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,360
Because you were a little dissatisfied,

657
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,200
you instructed your servant
to hit someone and create trouble,

658
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,480
disturbing the peace in this household

659
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,360
and sowing discord.

660
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Isn't that wrong?

661
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,520
How did you know that I
instructed her to do it?

662
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,240
Did Nanny Tao personally tell you?

663
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,640
Nanny Tao is your servant.

664
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,360
Everything she does

665
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,520
is related to you.

666
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,480
Don't you know that?

667
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,040
They sent the wrong portion,

668
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,520
but I didn't instruct anyone
to cause trouble.

669
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,160
You didn't investigate

670
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,240
and just came here to blame me.

671
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,480
How can you convince people

672
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
if you do things this way?

673
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,833
(A humble manner
brings you a good result)

674
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,800
My Lord.

675
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,600
Sharp-tongued and unreasonable.

676
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,240
Didn't he especially come here
to visit Her Ladyship?

677
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,520
Why did they argue again?

678
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,880
Your Ladyship.

679
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,440
You're going out?

680
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,160
I heard that His Lordship will accompany
His Majesty in hunting,

681
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,120
so I prepared some clothing
and items for him.

682
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,000
You're so thoughtful.

683
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,120
Lianfang.

684
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,320
Look.

685
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,440
The flowers in the garden are so nice.

686
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,040
It's a shame that I just love peonies.

687
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,160
No matter how nice the flowers are
here in the garden,

688
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,600
I won't appreciate them.

689
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,920
Only Xi Shi is the most beautiful
among ladies;

690
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,720
only peonies are the best among flowers.

691
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,200
But there are so many flowers
in the world.

692
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,440
Not everyone

693
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,160
loves peonies.

694
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,880
I prefer plum blossoms,

695
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,880
which bloom in the cold.

696
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,920
I'm not interested

697
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,600
in peonies at all.

698
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,880
What do you want to say? Please tell me.

699
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,120
Forgive me for being slow-witted.

700
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,320
I don't quite understand.

701
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,280
Peonies and plum blossoms bloom
in different seasons.

702
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,920
They won't really get to meet,

703
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,720
and they don't need to compete
with each other

704
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,080
to see which one is better.

705
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,920
If you only like peonies,

706
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,720
then just take good care of it.

707
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,840
Then the two flowers will be
at peace with each other.

708
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
If it must compete
with the plum blossom,

709
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,560
then I'm afraid the peony

710
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,560
is a bit more fragile than it.

711
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,600
Think about it.

712
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,880
Madam, what is she talking about?

713
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,080
It doesn't matter.

714
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,520
Let's go.

715
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,360
Back then, in this hunting ground,

716
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,840
Official Hu Jin

717
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,800
was utterly valiant

718
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,960
and had great riding and hunting skills.

719
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,000
Very few people can compete with him.

720
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,560
Countless preys

721
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,800
went into his bag.

722
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
I didn't expect

723
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,800
that he colluded with others
for nefarious purposes

724
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,720
and brought trouble to the government.

725
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,640
It's really impossible to judge a man's
heart based on outward appearances.

726
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,080
Actually,

727
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,800
you and Official Hu

728
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,120
were friends in the military.

729
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,360
I wonder how you felt

730
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
when Official Hu was executed.

731
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
You're taking so much pleasure
in someone's misfortune.

732
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,280
Could it be that Official Hu
offended you

733
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,360
when he was still alive?

734
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,800
In saying that,

735
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,920
aren't you making me out to be

736
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
a villain who adds insult to injury?

737
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,920
I'm just happy for the government

738
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,000
since we were able to eliminate
traitorous officials like Hu Jin.

739
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,360
It's like eliminating intractable
diseases like cancer.

740
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,040
It's what everyone wanted to happen,

741
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,440
and it pleased everyone.

742
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,880
Shut up!

743
00:35:58,279 --> 00:35:59,640
Even if Hu Jin made a mistake,

744
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,200
didn't he have accomplishments too?

745
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,680
After he became governor,

746
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:05,960
he quelled the bandits and relieved
the flooding disaster,

747
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,640
letting the citizens live peacefully
in the southern region.

748
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,400
How are you qualified to criticize him?

749
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,040
Why do you need to get so angry,
Duke Wei?

750
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,000
The government had already reached
a conclusion

751
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,360
about Hu Jin's accomplishments
and offenses.

752
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,719
Otherwise, why was he executed?

753
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,799
Are you doubting His Majesty's decision?

754
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,840
His Majesty was deceived

755
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,719
by treacherous villains.

756
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:24,560
-So...
-Duke Wei, mind your words.

757
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,160
Don't criticize
the government groundlessly.

758
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,320
Xu Lingyi.

759
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,760
I originally thought

760
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,360
that you're a respectable man.

761
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,480
I didn't expect

762
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,760
that you're someone who just echoes
the views of others.

763
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,840
Duke Wei, you've misunderstood.

764
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,080
I was afraid that your words

765
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,520
might reach the ears of villains

766
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,240
and give them a cause for gossip.

767
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,280
It won't be beneficial to you.

768
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,360
After all, executing Official Hu

769
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,800
was His Majesty's decision.

770
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,920
Will I, Ren Kun, be afraid

771
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,600
of those treacherous villains?

772
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,480
Marquis Yongping.

773
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,680
You and Hu Jin have been friends
for many years as well.

774
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,520
Could it be

775
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,520
that you also believe

776
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,760
the lies they used to attack him?

777
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Official Hu was free from corruption
and bribery.

778
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,520
He was just and fair.

779
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,320
How can he be someone

780
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
who formed factions in pursuit
of personal gains?

781
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,920
If he really had a faction,

782
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,520
when he was being attacked,

783
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
why didn't anyone help him?

784
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,080
Very few people defended him.

785
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,520
Duke Wei.

786
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,120
Treacherous officials are in power.

787
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,840
The government already
has one less righteous person

788
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,840
who worked for the sake of the nation
and the citizens.

789
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,320
I hope that you'll be cautious
with your words and actions

790
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,560
and take care of yourself.

791
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,960
He was too foolish.

792
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,320
How can one person

793
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,200
change anything?

794
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
But I believe

795
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,720
that Official Hu wasn't foolish.

796
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,080
It was precisely because he was
an honest man

797
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,880
that he knew the corrupt practices
in the nation,

798
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,520
just like how he was
the best of friends with you

799
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,280
because he knew
the kind of man you are.

800
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,000
You're right.

801
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,160
It was precisely because

802
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,600
we truly knew each other

803
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,440
that even if our political views
were different

804
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,480
and we often had disagreements,

805
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,600
we still remained friends.

806
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,080
Who knew

807
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,120
that he would die because of it?

808
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,000
Official Hu once told me

809
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,560
that even if the sea ban policy
is part of the ancestral policy,

810
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,760
it's an outdated and bad practice.

811
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,920
Now,

812
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,240
the banditry on the southeastern coast,

813
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,400
the poverty of the citizens,

814
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,480
and the empty national treasury

815
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,600
are all caused by it.

816
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,520
Only by lifting the sea ban

817
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,680
and performing maritime trading

818
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,720
can we totally

819
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,040
quell the bandits and save the citizens.

820
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,640
Timing decides fate.

821
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,760
Even so,

822
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,680
what can we do?

823
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,840
This concerns the ancestral policy.

824
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,320
It's not something

825
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,440
one or two people can change.

826
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:32,920
Your Ladyship.

827
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,680
I checked everywhere

828
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,840
in the mansion.

829
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,560
I still didn't find any clues.

830
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,400
Perhaps that person

831
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,080
isn't a female member

832
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,320
of this household at all.

833
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,040
Since we didn't find anything
through the embroidery items,

834
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,520
let's check the fabrics.

835
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,040
Your Ladyship.

836
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,840
Nanny Tao.

837
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
I have cooked some lotus seed sweet soup

838
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,640
for Zhun.

839
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,840
Try these too.

840
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,920
Thank you.

841
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,920
Are you aware

842
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,240
where the fabrics from a year ago

843
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,280
are kept?

844
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,600
A year ago?

845
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,840
Most of them should have already

846
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,440
been used up.

847
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,160
Even if anything is left,

848
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,960
it won't be kept here at the mansion.

849
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,720
It should be at the house
in the countryside.

850
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,560
Your Ladyship, why do you ask?

851
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,280
Nothing.

852
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,160
I was just thinking

853
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,440
that it would be wasted

854
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,360
if it's not used.

855
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,280
I can get some

856
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,800
to make embroidery items.

857
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,160
Try it.

858
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,600
They're back.

859
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
There's no need for courtesy.

860
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,400
Help Danyang sit down.

861
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,560
What happened?

862
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
Did your trip go smoothly?

863
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,880
Thank you for your concern, Mother.

864
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,120
Everything went smoothly.

865
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,040
Mother.

866
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,320
We were lucky, we met Master Hui'en,

867
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
who was traveling here,

868
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,640
so we asked him to read our fortune.

869
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,960
What did he say?

870
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,800
He said

871
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
I will clash with people
with the Chinese zodiac of ox.

872
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,920
I should avoid such people.
[*Clash: The incompatibility of zodiac signs]

873
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,080
That's easy.

874
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,520
I'll ask them to list down

875
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,920
everyone in the household
with the Chinese zodiac of ox,

876
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,400
and let them move

877
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,320
to the house in the countryside.

878
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
After you give birth

879
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,680
to the baby smoothly,

880
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,200
we'll ask them to come back.

881
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,240
Great Madam.

882
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:20,960
What's the matter?

883
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,440
It seems like Her Ladyship's
Chinese zodiac is ox.

884
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,040
How can this happen?

885
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,000
Mother.

886
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,600
I think

887
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,080
this isn't a good idea.

888
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,200
What that master said

889
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
might not be believable.

890
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,800
I think we should just forget it.

891
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,520
We can't forget about this.

892
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,160
The Xu family

893
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,000
only has a few members.

894
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,000
Offsprings

895
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,120
are the top priority of the Xu family.

896
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,920
Mother, it doesn't make any sense

897
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,960
for Shiyi to move to the house
in the countryside.

898
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,080
If news about it spreads,

899
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,760
they'll think that I'm bullying her.

900
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
That's enough.

901
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,000
Don't worry about it

902
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,240
too much.

903
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,280
Kuan'er.

904
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,680
Help Danyang back to the room.

905
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,040
Go.

906
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,880
Mother, we'll go ahead.

907
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,480
Take it slow.

908
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Great Madam.

909
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,600
Are you really going
to tell Her Ladyship

910
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,840
to move out?

911
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,480
What if she's not willing to?

912
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,000
Why won't she be willing to do it?

913
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,080
It's not like

914
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,520
she'll be staying there forever.

915
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,760
It's just temporary.

916
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,160
She'll be back.

917
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,160
If she's smart,

918
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,680
it will be good.

919
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,120
