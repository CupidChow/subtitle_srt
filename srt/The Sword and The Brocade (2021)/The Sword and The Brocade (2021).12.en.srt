Where's Shiyi on earth?

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,860
Father, Mother.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,100
I'm back!

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,500
My Lord, you are also here.

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,540
My Lord,

25
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,260
when I was looking for Her Ladyship,

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,120
she was right on the street.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,860
General Fu, she's not here.

Go check over there!

30
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,460
Yes.

(Tongren Herbal Medicine Shop)

33
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,500
Your Ladyship,
you've gone shopping for long.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,170
Have you bought anything?

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,180
Did you find the brocade

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
for Wuniang's cloth?

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,000
Unfortunately,

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,860
I checked all cloth shops in the city

39
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,290
but couldn't find the pattern I want.

40
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,380
So,

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,950
I came back empty-handed.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,260
Then Wuniang

43
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,140
will be happy for nothing.

44
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,930
It's good to see you back safely.

45
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,050
Since Shiyi is back safely,

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,580
we'll stop

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,380
disturbing you.

48
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,020
We'll go back now.

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,640
No hurry.

50
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,340
I happen to have a few bolts

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,750
of good fabric.

52
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,180
You can bring them back and make clothes

53
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,930
for Shiyi.

54
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,660
Shiyi,

55
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,690
come to my room and see which you like.

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,260
We'll chat a little bit

57
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,250
before you leave.

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,500
Sure.

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,420
Marquis,

60
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,700
have a seat.

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,780
What happened today exactly?

62
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,380
Dongqing and I

63
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,720
were kidnapped yesterday.

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,950
Thanks to brother
and Master Jian, we were saved.

65
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,400
Carry out our plan!

66
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,660
Your Ladyship!

67
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,300
Wake up, Your Ladyship!

68
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,820
You are not breathing!

69
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,050
What should I do? Your Ladyship!

70
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:47,810
Let's go!

71
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,100
Over there!

72
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,740
Don't run!

73
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,860
Stop!

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,700
Over there!

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,740
Stop! Don't run!

76
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,540
Teacher!

77
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,980
How did you find this place?

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,180
The rose perfume.

79
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,060
I remember you

80
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,140
used it last time,

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,180
so I followed the scent and found you.

82
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,100
The Marquis' men

83
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,460
are also looking for you.

84
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,460
I think

85
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,900
the Marquis is worried about you.

86
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,180
In that case,

87
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,660
I'll just play along

88
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,340
and let them find me.

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,420
You are quick-minded after all.

90
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,220
Otherwise it'd be a big trouble.

91
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,180
Although nothing happened this time,

92
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,620
it matters to your name and reputation.

93
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,660
Do not mention it

94
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,460
to anybody after you go back.

95
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,100
The Marquis is good at observing.

96
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,140
I think he's already suspicious.

97
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,660
Yes, Mother.

98
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,300
You need to be careful about
Concubine Qiao.

99
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,500
She gave me such a hard time today

100
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,500
and kept reminding the Marquis

101
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,620
that you were missing.

102
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,700
I don't know what she's up to.

103
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,860
But I'm sure she has something to do

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,940
with your abduction today.

105
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,340
Lianfang?

106
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,260
The government sent people here

107
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,300
right after the Marquis came.

108
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,940
Someone reported

109
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,740
that ladies of Luo family
were kidnapped.

110
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,660
So they asked us if anyone was missing.

111
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,060
Thinking about how Concubine Qiao
behaved today,

112
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm sure

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,380
she's the one who's
behind the whole thing.

114
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,100
Mother, don't worry.

115
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,620
I know what to do.

116
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,380
The Marquis is still waiting for you.

117
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,340
Go ahead.

118
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,420
Yes.

119
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,420
I moved to the villa

120
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,140
because my zodiac

121
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
conflicts with Danyang's.

122
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,980
And I've got Mother's approval.

123
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,100
My Lord, is it really okay

124
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,700
for me to get back?

125
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,900
People should not be superstitious.

126
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,900
The conflict of zodiacs

127
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,860
is just a groundless theory.

128
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,740
If Danyang is not well,

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,340
she should consult a physician.

130
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,260
How could she cause
trouble to the others?

131
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,740
Why are you looking at me like this?

132
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,860
I thought you'd rather
believe it was true.

133
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,660
I've told you.

134
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,900
Since you are my wife now,

135
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,100
I won't allow you

136
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,260
to be treated unfairly.

137
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,300
What's wrong?

138
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,220
I didn't sleep well last night.

139
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,460
I've got a cramp in my leg.

140
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,780
Let me see.

141
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,940
We always travel thousands
of miles in battles.

142
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,300
Leg injuries happen all the time.

143
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,020
Let me see.

144
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,660
I don't think it's proper

145
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,940
to check a woman's leg injury.

146
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,860
Are all the men

147
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,820
in this world careless like this?

148
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,980
Have...

149
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,260
Have you met a lot of men?

150
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,220
My Lord, don't get me wrong.

151
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,460
I was talking about the villa guards.

152
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,980
I went to Xianling Pavilion

153
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
to visit Master Jian the other day.

154
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,620
They disappeared for no reason.

155
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,460
Amber looked for them for a long time
but couldn't find them.

156
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,140
So

157
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,140
I brought Dongqing
to the Residence of Luo.

158
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,260
When I asked them later,

159
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,060
they said they had to
go to the bathroom!

160
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
Forget it. It's no big deal.

161
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,780
But

162
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,140
I really should thank

163
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,220
Lianfang.

164
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,300
She actually came to pick me up

165
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,620
together with you.

166
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,420
That's very thoughtful of her.

167
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,900
I will interrogate

168
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,500
the two guards you mentioned.

169
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,460
When we are home,

170
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,540
I'll get a physician

171
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,060
to take a look at your leg.

172
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,500
Your Ladyship,

173
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,460
His Lordship refuted

174
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,660
the theory of zodiac conflict,

175
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,980
and he went to pick you up in person

176
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,700
regardless of Great Madam's objection.

177
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Looks like

178
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,580
he is quite righteous

179
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,980
and impartial!

180
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,700
He does

181
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,820
have some good qualities.

182
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,140
But it's obvious

183
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,780
that Concubine Qiao
designed the whole thing.

184
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,660
So we'll just let her off easily?

185
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,780
No worries.

186
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,260
How can I make you guys suffer

187
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,660
because of me?

188
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,620
On my way back,

189
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,980
I've expressed my doubts about her

190
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,260
to His Lordship.

191
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,780
I'm sure he understood

192
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,100
what I meant.

193
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,900
Let's see how he will handle it.

194
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,980
That's good to know!

195
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,380
Amber,

196
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,700
come here.

197
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,580
Your Ladyship.

198
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,540
Here, take this.

199
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,700
Thanks to you guys,

200
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,180
I came back safely

201
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,300
this time.

202
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,580
You know

203
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,740
that I don't have any money,

204
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,180
so I can only reward you with this.

205
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,620
Hope you won't mind.

206
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,020
Well...

207
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,020
We can't accept this, Your Ladyship!

208
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,420
This is your dowry!

209
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,260
That's right, Your Ladyship.

210
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,580
It's our job to protect you.

211
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,340
How can we accept your reward?

212
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,980
To me,

213
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,820
you are all trustworthy.

214
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,380
Although it's not much,
it represents my sincere appreciation.

215
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,140
I will always remember

216
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,700
that you helped me!

217
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,420
Danyang,

218
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,900
I don't think it's appropriate

219
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,140
to kick Shiyi out.

220
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,260
Why don't we

221
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,740
figure out something else?

222
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,740
I didn't kick her out.

223
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,340
She left herself.

224
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,220
His Lordship scolded you,

225
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,380
and now you are blaming me!

226
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,980
My princess,

227
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,260
please lower your voice!

228
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,780
How dare I blame you?

229
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,980
I'm the one

230
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,380
who always gets blamed!

231
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm just discussing with you!

232
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,540
How about we move out?

233
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,980
We own a big house

234
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,340
in Fangsheng Alley.

235
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,020
I had someone checked it,

236
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,100
it'll do nothing but good to you.

237
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,420
What do you think?

238
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,460
I won't move!

239
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,980
Why should I give in?

240
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,060
If I must move,

241
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,820
I'll move back to my parents' house!

242
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,900
Stop the angry talk,

243
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,700
will you?

244
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,020
If you really move back
to your parents' house,

245
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,300
your father will skin me alive!

246
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,740
Madam, it's not a good thing

247
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,340
to be this stubborn.

248
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,460
When you get angry sometimes,

249
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,380
people would think
you are high-maintenance.

250
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,660
But about this matter,

251
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,140
when you deal with His Lordship,

252
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,980
even your father

253
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,340
has to respect him.

254
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,740
Besides,

255
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,420
no matter she's the daughter of
a concubine or not,

256
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,180
she's after all the Marquis' wife.

257
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,540
Even if Great Madam

258
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,980
is on our side,

259
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,220
we are

260
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,740
still in the wrong.

261
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,700
Right?

262
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,900
You always do the right thing.

263
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,220
Why don't you make yourself
look good on this matter?

264
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,020
What Mrs. Shi said

265
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,260
is correct

266
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,660
and reasonable!

267
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
Your father

268
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,420
trusts Mrs. Shi a lot.

269
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,140
You should listen to her.

270
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,100
Madam, you are smart.

271
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,420
Can't you see

272
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
that the Marquis' wife

273
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,100
has been really nice
about the whole thing?

274
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,620
But some people

275
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,900
tried to take advantage of
you and make trouble.

276
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,820
It's not worth it

277
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,300
to offend His Lordship

278
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,140
and let those people get their way

279
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,940
just for a moment of pleasure.

280
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,780
Of course I know about that.

281
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,300
I just can't get over the fact

282
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,740
that it was the wizard

283
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,220
who came up with
the zodiac conflict thing.

284
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:42,940
And it was

285
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Great Madam's idea to let her move out!

286
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,900
It wasn't my intention at all!

287
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,500
But now it looks like I'm the one

288
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,820
who has a problem with Shiyi!

289
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,380
Don't worry about that.

290
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,900
I'll go talk to Lingyi

291
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,940
and explain everything

292
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,420
to him.

293
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,460
Danyang, don't be angry.

294
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,060
It'll harm your health.

295
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,380
Alright! Fine!

296
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,700
I'll listen to you.

297
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,020
Let's move!

298
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,140
Danyang, you are so understanding!

299
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,540
I'll ask them to
make arrangement right now.

300
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,340
No worry.

301
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,860
I promise I'll make it

302
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,180
even nicer than this mansion!

303
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,260
Fine.

304
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,140
I'll just leave the mansion and get away

305
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
from those annoying women!

306
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,180
Danyang,

307
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,740
do you feel better?

308
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,460
I don't know why

309
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,100
but I felt a little pain
in my stomach again yesterday.

310
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,740
Then...

311
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,020
Mother, I've discussed with Danyang.

312
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,780
We'll move to Fangsheng Alley.

313
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,860
Move?

314
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,020
Why would you move?

315
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,660
His Lordship is the head of our family.

316
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,340
He needs Shiyi to be here!

317
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,660
I think it's better for us
to move out for now.

318
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,980
No!

319
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,580
I won't allow it!

320
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,460
What if all the running around

321
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,100
causes any symptoms of miscarriage?

322
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Lingyi,

323
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,060
Danyang is bearing

324
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,220
the child of our Xu Family!

325
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,060
Mother, Lingyi
has nothing to do with this.

326
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,580
I'm not talking to you!

327
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,060
Mother, don't be angry.

328
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,620
Danyang is pregnant.

329
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,020
It's not convenient for her to move.

330
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
The Nanhe Garden in the back yard

331
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,620
has been vacant for long,

332
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,980
but it's been taken care of.

333
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,180
Although it's a little small,

334
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,540
it's a quiet place.

335
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,100
I think they

336
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,860
can move there temporarily.

337
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,260
His Lordship's idea is good!

338
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,100
In that case,

339
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,580
it'll save us a lot of trouble.

340
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,580
Shiyi, sorry about the trouble.

341
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,420
Never mind.

342
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,380
Sit down.

343
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,860
Shiyi,

344
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,780
please don't

345
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,340
blame me for what happened before.

346
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,900
In theory,

347
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,940
you are the Marquis' wife,

348
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,900
the matron of Xu Family.

349
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,140
It was a little unfair to ask

350
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,780
you to move to the villa.

351
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,940
But as a family,

352
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,460
you are a daughter-in-law
of the Xu Family.

353
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,020
Don't you think it's your duty

354
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,020
to make some sacrifice

355
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,540
for the descendants of Xu Family?

356
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,100
Mother,

357
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,700
it was my decision

358
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,660
to move to the villa.

359
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,020
You don't have to worry.

360
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,140
His Lordship is here!

361
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,900
His Lordship is here?

362
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,940
My Lord, you are here!

363
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,020
Xiuyuan, go get the tea.

364
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,820
I need you to do something.

365
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,660
Anything, My Lord.

366
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,420
Go get a catty of
blood nest and two catties

367
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,620
of ginseng from the storage room,

368
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,980
and bring them to Danyang.

369
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,940
Tell her

370
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,660
that it's a gift from Shiyi.

371
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:19,900
Yes.

372
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,220
My Lord,

373
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,740
I brewed some

374
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,500
mount Lu cloud-mist tea for you.

375
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,620
I heard

376
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,580
that the birds first spread the seeds

377
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,580
in the cracks between
the mountain rocks.

378
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,620
The poem reads "The cloud-mist tea
absorbs the essence of nature."

379
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,100
So it means the tea is very aromatic.

380
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,860
Who's taking care

381
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,540
of Xishan Villa right now?

382
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,580
Mrs. Liu

383
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,380
is in charge of the villa.

384
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,900
When Her Ladyship stayed there,

385
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,740
it was also her

386
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,780
who took care of everything.

387
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,940
Where did you find her?

388
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,780
She used

389
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,460
to watch the yard in the mansion.

390
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,420
I saw that she was quite reliable,

391
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,220
so I sent her

392
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,100
to Xishan Villa half a year ago.

393
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,460
Get her back.

394
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,380
Did she

395
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,020
do anything wrong?

396
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,820
You don't know?

397
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,260
I

398
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,660
really don't.

399
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,620
Shiyi went out one day

400
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,020
when she stayed there.

401
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,500
Mrs. Liu arranged two guards for her,

402
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,780
but they completely
neglected their duty.

403
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,140
Does that sound

404
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,340
reliable to you?

405
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,380
My Lord, I'm in charge of
household affairs,

406
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,580
but I used the wrong person!

407
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,140
Please forgive me, My Lord!

408
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,820
I didn't expect

409
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
that Mrs. Liu

410
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,420
could be this irresponsible!

411
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,980
I didn't find out until today.

412
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,020
My Lord,

413
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,900
I'll investigate into it

414
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,300
and deal with it impartially.

415
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,020
Don't bother.

416
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,260
I don't think you'll find out anything.

417
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,140
An irresponsible person like her

418
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,900
deserves to be punished severely.

419
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,220
Yes.

420
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
He first got Luo Shiyi back

421
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,820
regardless of Great Madam's order,

422
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,340
and now he blamed me so harshly

423
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,700
because of her.

424
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,060
He doesn't seem

425
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,500
to favor her so much,

426
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,260
but why does

427
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,460
he try so hard to protect her?

428
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,460
Is it really because

429
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,140
she's the legal wife,

430
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,620
and I'm a concubine?

431
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,620
Madam, don't be sad about that.

432
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,420
Although Luo Shiyi was born as a humble,

433
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,580
she's after all Luo Yuanniang's
younger sister.

434
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,900
His Lordship

435
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,860
has to be nice to her
on account of the Luo family.

436
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,780
Madam, don't think too much.

437
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,140
The good thing

438
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,380
is that we've prepared for it

439
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,340
and sent the two guards away.

440
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,180
His Lordship won't find out anything.

441
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,700
She didn't fall into our trap this time,

442
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,380
instead, she put us in trouble.

443
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,740
Not only was I scolded by His Lordship,

444
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,500
I also lost Mrs. Liu.

445
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,940
Looks like

446
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,900
I underestimated her!

447
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,100
Madam, that's why

448
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,420
you need to pull yourself together!

449
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,060
Good that you are still

450
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,420
in charge of the mansion management.

451
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,180
We still have plenty of time

452
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,500
to deal with her.

453
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,980
Your Ladyship,

454
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,540
I heard that Mrs. Liu

455
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,020
lost her job at Xishan Villa

456
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,740
and was sent back to village.

457
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,580
Can't believe that
His Lordship also knows

458
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,220
how the mansion management works.

459
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,980
But

460
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,900
don't know if Danyang

461
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,780
will appreciate this

462
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,140
carrot-and-stick strategy.

463
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,940
His Lordship is busy every day.

464
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,820
It's not easy for him to think of that.

465
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,260
It was his way to comfort Danyang

466
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,020
and protect the peace of the family.

467
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,820
His tactics are tough but also mellow.

468
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,380
I guess we underestimated him before.

469
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,660
Your Ladyship, Concubine Qiao is here.

470
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,940
Let her in.

471
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,260
Why is she here?

472
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,580
Nothing happened to her.

473
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,580
She's made that Mrs. Liu

474
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,460
a scapegoat anyway.

475
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,420
Dongqing.

476
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,860
Your Ladyship.

477
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
Lianfang, what brings you here?

478
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,940
This is the allowance of this month.

479
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,500
20 taels.

480
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,980
Please keep it.

481
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,340
Thank you for delivering it in person.

482
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,300
Dongqing, put it away.

483
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,740
Your Ladyship,
what are you embroidering?

484
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,340
It looks so interesting.

485
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,460
The weather is warming up now.

486
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,020
I'm making Mother a sachet

487
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,620
for insect repellent.

488
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,660
You are so thoughtful!

489
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,220
Although you don't have

490
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,780
to manage the housework,

491
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,700
you can still

492
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,420
find things to do

493
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,220
and keep yourself busy every day.

494
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
No wonder His Lordship said

495
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,300
you are needed in the family.

496
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,460
Many accidents happened recently.

497
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,980
I'm not surprised that
His Lordship thinks this way.

498
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,420
Lianfang,

499
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,140
you've got to be more careful.

500
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,980
No matter it's His Lordship

501
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,340
or Great Madam,

502
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,460
they are all sharp-eyed.

503
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
They both

504
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
know it clearly

505
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,500
whether you do good or not.

506
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,380
Right, Lianfang?

507
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,420
You are right!

508
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,140
That's why Great Madam feels relieved

509
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,940
to let me manage the mansion.

510
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,460
Then you should do your best.

511
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,420
Don't let her down.

512
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,740
Your Ladyship, no need to worry!

513
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,580
Take a walk outside when you are free.

514
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,060
Don't strain your eyes.

515
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,020
I'll take my leave now.

516
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,660
Your Ladyship,

517
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,980
your words just now

518
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,620
really humiliated her!

519
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,540
Didn't you see

520
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,020
that her face all turned blue!

521
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,540
Unfortunately,

522
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,980
I don't have any evidence

523
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,020
to prove that she's the one

524
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,380
who tried to harm me at the villa.

525
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,500
I can't do anything for now

526
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,540
but being more cautious.

527
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,620
We'll figure out something later.

528
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,180
Now we have 20 taels of silver!

529
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,100
So great!

530
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,700
Yes.

531
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,500
The money here

532
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,220
is enough to cover

533
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,780
the expenses for a while.

534
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,620
That's right.

535
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,300
When we stayed at the villa,

536
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,140
we didn't even have money
to reward the servants.

537
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,180
From now on, we'll

538
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,980
get 20 taels every month.

539
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
No one will laugh

540
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,540
at us anymore!

541
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,900
Look how happy you are!

542
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,740
Alright.

543
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,780
Go ahead and put the money away.

544
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,700
Just 20 taels

545
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,180
already makes them happy like this!

546
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,340
They sure come from a poor family.

547
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,540
Your Ladyship,

548
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm here to see you.

549
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,140
I heard your leg was injured.

550
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,860
I brought you some high-grade medicine.

551
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,020
Your Ladyship, you are finally back!

552
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,380
Please go and take a look at Zhun!

553
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,340
He was sick and in a coma.

554
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
We can't even wake him up!

555
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,420
Poor kid!

556
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,580
Mother, My Lord.

557
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,500
What happened to Zhun?

558
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,140
He was still fine when I left.

559
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,620
During the time you weren't home,

560
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,060
Zhun got tinea corporis.

561
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,100
He got much better a few days ago,

562
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,260
but...but it came back!

563
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,980
He couldn't eat and sleep

564
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,660
because of the disease.

565
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,580
Sister, you are attentive and reliable.

566
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
I trust you the most.

567
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,340
I want you to take care

568
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,940
of Zhun for me in the future!

569
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,620
Your Ladyship,

570
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,340
Zhun's condition is quite complicated.

571
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,820
You've left for long

572
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,820
and you aren't familiar
with his condition.

573
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,580
Why don't you go take a rest first?

574
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,980
I'll be here and take care of him.

575
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,140
Lianfang is right.

576
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,260
Shiyi,

577
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,700
you don't have to stay.

578
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,340
Let Lianfang take care of Zhun.

579
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,940
It's itchy!

580
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,060
-Zhun!
-Zhun!

581
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,140
Zhun! You can't scratch
no matter how itchy it is!

582
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,820
Zhun!

583
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,140
It's itchy!

584
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,420
Do not scratch!

585
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,500
Mother is here.

586
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,500
-Don't scratch!
-Good boy!

587
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,260
Don't scratch! Don't scratch!

588
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,300
Zhun, be good!

589
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,140
-Don't cry! Don't cry!
-Zhun is a good boy!

590
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,900
It's itchy!

591
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,900
I have an idea.

592
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,500
(Residence of Luo)

593
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,780
This medicine

594
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,340
can relieve the itching.

595
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,980
Your Ladyship, what is it?

596
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,460
This is the itching relief medicine

597
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,740
we used when we were in Yuhang.

598
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,700
It works very well!

599
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,020
How can we

600
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
apply such strong

601
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,140
rural medicine

602
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,620
on Zhun?

603
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,540
That's right.

604
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,820
Lianfang is right.

605
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,900
Shiyi,

606
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,060
don't use this medicine on him.

607
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,900
I'm Zhun's Mother.

608
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,420
Of course I care about him.

609
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,700
If this medicine was strong,

610
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,220
I wouldn't use it on Zhun.

611
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,860
Mother,

612
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,180
all family members

613
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,220
of Luo

614
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,180
have used this medicine.

615
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,260
There won't be any problem.

616
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,500
It's not a strong medicine.

617
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,220
Do it.

618
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,940
Lingyi.

619
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,860
Mother. Do you have any other idea?

620
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,780
Then...

621
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,740
Do it.

622
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:53,940
Here.

623
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,740
Here, Zhun.

624
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,580
Give me your hand.

625
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,500
He's asleep!

626
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,020
Zhun is asleep!

627
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,420
The medicine really worked!

628
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,460
Let Shiyi

629
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,700
take care of Zhun in the future.

630
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,620
Yes.

631
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,500
I will take good care of him.

632
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,980
Seeing that he's getting better,

633
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,020
I can finally

634
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,180
-be relieved!
-Here!

635
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,940
Throw it to me!

636
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Nanny Tao, don't worry!

637
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,900
Zhun will get well soon!

638
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,540
Ready? Catch it!

639
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,340
One. Two. Three!

640
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,300
Madam.

641
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,300
Your Ladyship.

642
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,500
Your Ladyship, no worry.

643
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,780
Imperial Physician Liu said

644
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,180
that Zhun has almost recovered.

645
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,660
He also prescribed
some medicine for him.

646
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,380
Here! Catch!

647
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,300
My Lord.

648
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,100
Zhun.

649
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,740
Take good care of Zhun.

650
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,140
I don't wanna play anymore.

651
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,580
I want to go back.

652
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,100
Okay. Let's go inside.

653
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,340
Come with us.

654
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,580
Okay.

655
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,300
Zhun, what bothers you?

656
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,540
If you didn't want your Father to go,

657
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,820
why didn't you tell him?

658
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,900
Take a good rest.

659
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,660
You can tell him tomorrow, okay?

660
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,060
Good boy!

661
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,500
Now, put your arms under the sheet.

662
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,660
Close your eyes.

663
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,380
Yu!

664
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,380
What are you doing here?

665
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,860
What's up?

666
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,860
I'm here to check

667
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,540
on my brother.

668
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,620
Would you like to go inside and see him?

669
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,660
Since he's in bed now,

670
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,540
I won't disturb him anymore.

671
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,500
Your Ladyship, sorry to disturb you.

672
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,740
What are you doing here?

673
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,300
Yu is worried about Zhun.

674
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,380
So he came here to check on him.

675
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,820
Sorry to disturb you!

676
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
You should focus on study!

677
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,620
Don't run around!

678
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,500
Your Ladyship,

679
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,620
I'll take him back to study now.

680
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,140
Zhun has many people
to take care of him.

681
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,780
Don't come here and make trouble!

682
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,620
Your Ladyship,

683
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,860
the legal wife's child is different
from the concubine's.

684
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,340
Great Madam doesn't want

685
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,740
Yu and Zhun get too close.

686
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,580
Now that Zhun is sick,

687
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,380
Concubine Wen will try even harder

688
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,900
to separate Yu and Zhun.

689
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,820
Yu also avoids seeing him.

690
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,380
I see.

691
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
But I think

692
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,500
it'd be nice if the two brothers

693
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,700
can be close to each other.

694
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,500
Your Ladyship,

695
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,940
the legal wife's child is different
from the concubine's.

696
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,340
I've told you many times.

697
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,700
Don't get too close to Zhun!

698
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,380
What if his condition

699
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,980
is getting worse when you are

700
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,780
with him?

701
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,700
Can you explain that?

702
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,900
Her Ladyship married into our family

703
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,180
so that she can take care of Zhun.

704
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,540
Don't be stupid and
get yourself involved!

705
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,340
Do you remember

706
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,460
what I said today?

707
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,420
I remember now.

708
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,900
Wen and the others
don't want anything to do with it.

709
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,900
Why are you here to check on Zhun?

710
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,580
Taking care of Young Master Xu is my job.

711
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,780
Xu Family treats me well.

712
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,260
If I walk away from him

713
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,580
in fear of some gossip,

714
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,420
that'll be too ungrateful.

715
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,500
Besides, I like kids a lot.

716
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,500
Then please watch him for me.

717
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,780
I'll go decoct the medicine.

718
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,700
Your Ladyship.

719
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,340
Zhun!

720
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,060
You look so good today!

721
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,420
But I'm afraid you have

722
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,260
to wait for a while.

723
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,500
Great Madam went out.

724
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,980
I want sugar rice cake.

725
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,940
Zhun,

726
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,940
you are not totally

727
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
recovered yet.

728
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,900
You can't eat that,

729
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,340
or you'll get stomachache.

730
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,740
I want sugar rice cake!

731
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,380
I want it!

732
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,100
Zhun finally has some appetite.

733
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,860
Your Ladyship,
please allow him to have some.

734
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,900
If Zhun enjoys it,

735
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,900
he may get well faster.

736
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,260
You're the best!

737
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,060
What's going on?

738
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,900
I heard you from outside.

739
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,060
What happened here?

740
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,260
-Great Madam.
-Grandma!

741
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,260
-Mother.
-My Lord.

742
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,100
Zhun wants to eat sugar rice cake.

743
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,140
But Her Ladyship doesn't allow.

744
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
I think she is being too cautious.

745
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,820
I think it'll be fine.

746
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,980
Is that necessary?

747
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,980
Zhun has just recovered.

748
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,020
He finally has appetite now.

749
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,860
Why don't you let him eat?

750
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,340
How can a parent

751
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,460
be this strict on

752
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,100
her own child?

753
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,700
It's been quite tiring

754
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,020
for her to take care

755
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,660
of Zhun these days.

756
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,860
I guess

757
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,860
she's worried that the sweet stuff

758
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,460
will make his condition worse.

759
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,420
If it's tiring, just say it.

760
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,060
We are not shorthanded in the mansion.

761
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,140
Mother.

762
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,900
Zhun.

763
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,660
Zhun's spleen and
stomach are still weak.

764
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,500
Sugar rice cake is tasty,

765
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,020
but the glutinous rice
is hard to digest.

766
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,580
It'll cause nausea and kill his appetite

767
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,980
for main meals.

768
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,540
In that case,

769
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,060
you should've said it earlier.

770
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,060
Zhun, come here.

771
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,300
Let me ask you something.

772
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,900
Go ahead.

773
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Do you

774
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,220
want to eat this sugar rice cake

775
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,460
and get a stomachache,

776
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,940
or put it down

777
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,060
and play with me outside?

778
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,500
I can choose myself?

779
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,100
Your Mother is right.

780
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,660
You can choose yourself.

781
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,180
Zhun,

782
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,300
if you think the
sugar rice cake is nice,

783
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,340
why don't you

784
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,780
give one piece to your Father?

785
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,300
Your Father found

786
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,780
your favorite toy and gave it

787
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
to you specially.

788
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,900
Father, please.

789
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,300
It's tasty.

790
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,100
I like it.

791
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,980
Father, will you

792
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,820
get a stomachache after eating it?

793
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,980
When you grow up and become

794
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,060
as healthy as me,

795
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,300
sugar rice cake will never
make your stomach ache again.

796
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,900
I like the nine-linked rings game.

797
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,260
Thank you, Father!

798
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,420
Mother, be careful!

799
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,540
This Shiyi is so

800
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,180
good at arguing.

801
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,420
She's even smarter than me!

802
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,860
Mother, don't be angry.

803
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,900
Shiyi

804
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,700
was doing that for Zhun's good.

805
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,700
I think you just

806
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,700
feel bad for Lianfang, right?

807
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,540
Even the servants can see

808
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,420
that you favor Lianfang.

809
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,340
As the legal wife, Shiyi

810
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,660
has never complained,

811
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,980
and she always does
her best for our family.

812
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,780
It shows that she's a kind-hearted

813
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,180
and broad-minded person.

814
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,340
What would she complain about?

815
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,860
Lianfang has to humble herself
and be a concubine.

816
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,860
Everybody knows

817
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,980
that it was Yuanniang's idea.

818
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,420
And now she's married into our Xu Family

819
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,820
and become the legal wife.

820
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,460
It's such a bliss for her!

821
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,300
But what about Lianfang?

822
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,500
Lianfang has done so much

823
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,460
for me and Lingyi.

824
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,700
She's unselfish and generous.

825
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,380
She deserves my respect and favor.

826
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,100
Mother, have some tea.

827
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,900
Don't scratch.

828
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,980
Don't let him scratch

829
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,820
before he's completely recovered.

830
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,580
Okay.

831
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,060
Zhun.

832
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,740
Poor Zhun.

833
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,180
What should we do?

834
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,460
He is...

835
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,140
Great Madam.

836
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,780
Madam Luo.

837
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,180
I thought he was getting better.

838
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,980
How come he's sick again?!

839
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,420
Mother,

840
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,180
the Imperial Physician
just took a look at him.

841
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,260
Zhun will be fine.

842
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,340
Don't worry.

843
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,180
His condition is stable now.

844
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,860
I thought

845
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,900
he was almost recovered.

846
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,540
How come it came back again?

847
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,580
It must be because

848
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,580
he got infected

849
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,420
from something he touched or ate.

850
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,460
You've got

851
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
to watch him carefully.

852
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,740
Thank you, Imperial Physician Liu!

853
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,020
We will take good care of him.

854
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,740
Imperial Physician Liu,

855
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,460
could you please

856
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,300
stay in our mansion tonight?

857
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,060
Of course.

858
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,020
My poor Zhun!

859
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,180
Grandma is here to see you!

860
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,500
Shiyi,

861
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,380
how did it happen?

862
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,780
You are the one who's

863
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,340
been taking care of Zhun.

864
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,740
How did he...

865
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,340
Great Madam,

866
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,940
as far as I know,

867
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,140
the cause of infection

868
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,460
is like rootless wood
or sourceless water.

869
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,980
There are many people

870
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,020
coming in and out in the mansion.

871
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,820
It's really hard to prevent.

872
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,860
Even so,

873
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,740
you shouldn't be so careless.

874
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,700
Remember to check the visitors
carefully in the future.

875
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,260
Don't make any mistakes again!

876
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,020
Yes, Mother!

877
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,100
Don't you remember

878
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,780
what you promised your eldest sister

879
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
before she died?

880
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,940
Don't think I don't know.

881
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,700
Ever since you
married into the mansion,

882
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,820
you've never cared

883
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,140
about Zhun.

884
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,260
You should be held accountable

885
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,060
for Zhun's illness!

886
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,620
Madam Luo,

887
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,060
Her Ladyship decided

888
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,140
to move to the villa herself!

889
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,340
Qiao Lianfang is evil-minded.

890
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,340
How could she treat Zhun right?

891
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,260
With her, Zhun was like a sheep

892
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,100
in a tiger's den!

893
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,740
Poor Zhun!

894
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,580
He has to suffer that much

895
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,460
at such a young age!

896
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,540
Nanny Tao, your words

897
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,260
are unfair to Her Ladyship.

898
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,180
She does her best every day

899
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,980
to take care of Zhun.

900
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,780
She doesn't even have time

901
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,980
to eat or sleep!

902
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,820
Can't you see that?

903
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,260
I...

904
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,500
How dare you

905
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,780
interrupt your Master?

906
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,540
Nanny Xu.

907
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,020
Yes.

908
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,660
Slap her!

909
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,100
Yes!
