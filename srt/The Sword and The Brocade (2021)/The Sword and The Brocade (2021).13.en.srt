Yes.

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,580
Slap her!

22
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,020
Yes!

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,860
You are in the Xu Family

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,980
and not in your Luo Family.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,420
You think you are strong enough
to disobey me?

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,300
Don't forget

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,220
who has lifted you,
the daughter of a concubine

to a high position.

29
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,580
You both got a point,
mother and Nanny Tao.

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,740
If I had showed

31
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,500
more solicitude for Zhun,

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,540
his illness

33
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,140
wouldn't have worsened so much.

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,500
Mother, please set your mind at rest.

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,740
From now on,

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,500
I will take care of Zhun

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,580
and protect him wholeheartedly

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,580
to make sure that no harm
will be done to him.

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,500
Whether you said this

40
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,260
sincerely or perfunctorily,

41
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,580
there is one thing that

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,220
you must bear in mind:

43
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,660
Only our Luo Family

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
can back you up as your root.

45
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,500
Let me escort you out, Mother.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,380
Take good care of Zhun.

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,860
Amber.

48
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,180
Your Ladyship.

49
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,500
How is it?

50
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,460
I have searched

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,900
Zhun's abode thoroughly,

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,860
but didn't find

53
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,260
any exopathogen.

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,540
But, please don't worry.

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,580
I have sent men

56
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,020
to search the outer courtyard.

57
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,020
They will surely find the
source of the illness.

58
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,540
Those are all the things

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,500
Zhun can come into contact
with in ordinary days.

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,900
He was sound and fine previously.

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,540
But he is ill now

62
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,300
and the exopathogen

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,620
remains unknown.

64
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,220
Yu.

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,380
Come here.

66
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,140
Amber, go do your business.

67
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,380
Yes.

68
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,340
Mother.

69
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,820
I heard that Zhun relapsed again.

70
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,700
How is he now?

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,260
Don't worry.

72
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,020
With your father and grandma here,

73
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,180
he will be fine.

74
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,860
Would you like to go in to pay a visit?

75
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,140
I'd better leave.

76
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,380

79
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,660
How is he?

80
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,980
He has been sleeping
since he took the medicine.

81
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,060
Mother.

82
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,660
Zhun.

83
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,820
-Mother.
-Zhun, you are a good boy.

84
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,620
You are a good boy, Zhun.

85
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,580
-I am here.
-Mother.

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,820
I am here. I am here.

87
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Mother.

88
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,860
Mother.

89
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,060
Mother.

90
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,940
Zhun, are you feeling unwell?

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
I am with you.

92
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,340
-Don't cry. Don't cry.
-Mother.

93
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,260
Would you like me to sing you a song?

94
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,780
I will ask someone to
send for Imperial Physician Liu.

95
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,180
It doesn't matter.

96
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,060
Don't worry, My Lord.

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,260
Imperial Physician Liu said that

98
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,860
Zhun would be
like this during nighttime.

99
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,900
This is normal.

100
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,780
-Mother.
-My sweetheart Zhun.

101
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,380
Mother.

102
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,260
You are a good boy, Zhun.

103
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,660
I will sing you a song.

without any rest.

119

You must be tired.

It's nothing.

121
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
My Lord, won't you go to court today?

122
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,140

Zhun.

124
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,540
What is wrong?

125
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,580
Are you feeling unwell anywhere?

126
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,020
Why are you sweating so much?

127
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,540
How come this happened suddenly?

128
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,460
Attendants!

Hurry, hurry to send for
the imperial physician.

131
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,100
Yes, My Lord.

132

You will be all right.

136
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,060
You will be all right.
You will be all right.

137
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,620
Are you feeling any better?

138
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,180

139
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:24,900
What?

140
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,100
Handwriting.

141
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,420
Handwriting?

142
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,060
Are you trying to say that

How is he, physician?

155
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,340
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

156
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,140
Zhun's illness has worsened.

157
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,540
I have to perform acupuncture
on him immediately

158
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,780
to treat him.

159
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,380
May I ask you to wait outside?

160
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,620
Please save him, physician.

161
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
Don't worry, My Lord.

162
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,900
Zhun is much blessed.

163
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,540
He will be recoverd for sure.

164
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,900
Zhun's handwriting is so beautiful.

165
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,940
It can be seen that

166
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,980
he has put a lot of work into it.

167
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,620
After he wakes up,

168
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,260
you must praise him decently.

169
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,540
It is true that

170
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,300
I am usually too strict with him.

171
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,860
Zhun can understand
why you are doing that.

172
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,500
He has never blamed you for that.

173
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,940
We all understand you, too.

174
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,420
Zhun is your first-born legitimate son.

175
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,180
He is meant to take over
great responsibility.

176
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,940
For this reason,

177
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,180
you have been

178
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,780
especially strict with him.

179
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,940
But I have forgotten that

180
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,820
he is only a kid
who has lost his mother.

181
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,700
After Zhun gets well,

182
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,580
you must make it up to him, My Lord.

183
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,620
Great Madam is here.

184
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,820
Greetings to you, Mother.

185
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,620
Greetings to you, Mother.

186
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,820
Shiyi.

187
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,020
Thank you for your hard work
all these days.

188
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,460
Before Zhun gets well,

189
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,020
you shall stay in Western Lateral Court

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,420
and shall not walk around at will.

191
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,180
Mrs Du.

192
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Carry Zhun to the Fushou Court.

193
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,500
Mother.

194
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,820
Why are you doing this?

195
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,780
Don't ask more about it.

196
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,260
I will take good care of Zhun.

197
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,340
Mother.

198
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,340
I don't know what happened
to make you do this.

199
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,580
But, could you please

200
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,300
allow Zhun to stay here
till he gets well?

201
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,980
I am doing this

202
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,500
for the sake of Zhun.

203
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,060
Mother.

204
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,020
This time, you must

205
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,860
give me a reason.

206
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,740
I just came back from the Ci'an Temple.

207
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,660
The divination stick says that

208
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,300
Shiyi

209
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,780
is Zhun's nemesis.

210
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,740
The Nemesis.

211
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,860
So they must be separated.

212
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,580
Here comes the superstition again.

213
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,580
It is nonsense.

214
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,020
How can Shiyi

215
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,300
be blamed for this?

216
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,220
It is so unfair to her.

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,060
There is no such thing.

218
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,780
Lingyi.

219
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,220
The imperial physician will treat
Zhun over there.

220
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,540
Even if Shiyi is not with him,

221
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,260
it will make no difference.

222
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,260
Even if I am muddled-headed

223
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,020
and the divination is untrustworthy,

224
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,980
as the matron of our Xu Family,

225
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,740
it is reasonable for Shiyi

226
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,540
to make some sacrifice, isn't it?

227
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,460
What should I say to you?

228
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,780
I know

229
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,260
you are an atheist

230
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,140
and stick to impartiality
in doing things.

231
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,660
But you must remember that

232
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,740
besides being a father, a son,

233
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,620
an older brother and a husband,

234
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,820
you are also the master of our
Xu Family in the first place.

235
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,180
To have offspring

236
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,540
is the most important matter
of our Xu Family.

237
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,180
Remember it.

238
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,740
I don't agree.

239
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,820
To use such kind of made-up nonsense

240
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,140
as an excuse again

241
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,500
for putting Shiyi under house arrest.

242
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,260
Just do what mother said.

243
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,940
My Lord, don't worry about me.

244
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,660
I will take good care of myself.

245
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:21,500
(Fortune)

246
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,500
As for the Ci'an Temple...

247
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Set your mind at rest, Madam.

248
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,260
I ensure that nothing will go wrong

249
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,740
and nobody will track it back to us.

250
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,020
(Virtue of Purity and Nobility)

251
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,140
You are back.

252
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,020
I heard that Zhun is ill.

253
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Is his illness serious?

254
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,900
It is said that Physician Liu
of the Imperial Hospital

255
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,220
has been called over.

256
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,020
Since Zhun is ill,

257
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,060
it must be hard for Shiyi

258
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,420
to live in the Mansion of Xu.

259
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,740
I'll go visit her.

260
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,340
What are you looking for?

261
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,660
I can't go without any gift.

262
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,380
You are really a pedant.

263
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,100
Where is our available money?

264
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,180
What happened?

265
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,580
Yan Zhixiao is going to take up his
post somewhere else.

266
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,820
I treated him to some wine

267
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,300
in Chunxi Restaurant.

268
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,580
You dined there again?

269
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,500
You have visited that restaurant
many times this month.

270
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,820
How could we manage to live our life

271
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,980
if you keep doing this?

272
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,700
Wuniang,

273
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,460
I know

274
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,860
Zhixiao is definitely not
an average person.

275
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,460
When he makes his way
in the world someday,

276
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,540
he will surely be helpful for me.

277
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,620
I tried to befriend him

278
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,660
for the sake of our future.

279
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,260
We can't only think about saving money.

280
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,180
Wuniang, anger is not
good for your health.

281
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,260
I dare not do it again, OK?

282
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,620
Yeah, money should be spent
on some occasions.

283
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,660
But you have to consider

284
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,100
how we can live our life.

285
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,940
We don't have other sources of income.

286
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,220
If we don't live frugally,

287
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,140
how could we manage to make ends meet?

288
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,820
Wuniang, I have considered

289
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,260
all these things you said.

290
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,660
But I think that now

291
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,940
we should try to broaden our
sources of income

292
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,340
instead of reducing our expenditure.

293
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,820
I found that

294
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,100
there are few dried fruit shops
in the capital.

295
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,540
A storefront in the West Street

296
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,100
happens to be vacant.

297
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,020
We'd better purchase it.

298
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,140
Easier said than done.

299
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,380
We need capital to run our own shop.

300
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,940
How can we raise the fund?

301
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,580
Aren't you going to the Mansion of Xu

302
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,260
to visit Zhun?

303
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,980
You can take the chance to
mention it to Shiyi

304
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,940
that we are willing to

305
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,460
enter into partnership
with her to do business.

306
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,740
With the help from the Xu Family,

307
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,620
we will achieve success naturally.

308
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,980
You have a point there.

309
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Well, if so,

310
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,540
it will be more improper
for me to go empty-handed.

311
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,180
That will be a great disgrace.

312
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,660
I still have the bird's nest
as part of my dowry.

313
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,460
Maybe I should take it
with me as a gift.

314
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,220
Wuniang,

315
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,260
you have done so much for our family.

316
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,380
It is fine as long as you know it.

317
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,140
You must work hard in your study.

318
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,860
When you pass the imperial exam
and obtain official rank one day,

319
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,780
all our efforts

320
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,060
will be worthwhile.

321
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Right.

322
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,700
I will try my best to pass the exam
as early as possible.

323
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,460
By then,

324
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,140
I will let you live the best life

325
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,860
and won't allow you to bother
about anything.

326
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,220
As you said,

327
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,300
subject to the ancestral policy,

328
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,020
Duke Wei can't be persuaded
for the time being.

329
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,700
Then, how should we

330
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,500
deal with the current situation?

331
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,780
We need to bide our time.

332
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,860
Now Marquis Jingyuan is
in his prime of power

333
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,980
and the sea ban policy
is deeply-rooted.

334
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,100
If we are anxious for success,

335
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,580
we will make ourselves vulnerable
to other's attacks.

336
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,860
Your words made sense, My Lord.

337
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,060
All along, the adherents of
Marquis Jingyuan

338
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,940
have been engaged
in many corrupt practices.

339
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,420
We only need to be patient

340
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,020
to find their weak points.

341
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,620
Then we will undermine their power.

342
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,980
Given enough time,

343
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,180
I am sure we will be able
to uproot his force.

344
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,540
To date, the Ou Family

345
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,980
hasn't decided on an Heir Apparent.

346
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,260
Ou Lixing

347
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,220
is not more astute and scheming
than Marquis Jingyuan.

348
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,700
He is also anxious

349
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,420
to butter up Marquis Jingyuan.

350
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,820
This will give us a chance.

351
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,380
Rest assured, My Lord.

352
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,180
I will send men

353
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,540
to keep watching Ou Lixing.

354
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,740
Mother. Mother.

355
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,020
Yu,

356
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,580
did they give you a hard time
knowing you would come here?

357
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,580
Don't worry, Mother.

358
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,500
They didn't notice that

359
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,500
I sneaked in.

360
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,820
You slippery boy!

361
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,620
Dongqing, go fetch the pastries.

362
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,740
Come, Yu, be seated.

363
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,780
Well, Mother.

364
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,620
Previously, you told me

365
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,700
to keep an eye on Zhun, right?

366
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,980
Now I know

367
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,900
where Zhun goes secretly
for play in normal days.

368
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,020
Tell me.

369
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,820
Do you know

370
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,620
where Zhun usually goes for play,

371
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,180
especially the place he
visits secretly for play?

372
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,180
No, I don't know.

373
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,540
Since Zhun fell ill,

374
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,580
Concubine Qiao has been
taking care of him.

375
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,900
So I seldom had the chance to see him.

376
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,060
Yu,

377
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,220
could you

378
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,300
do me a favor?

379
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,940
What can I do for you, Mother?

380
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,860
I want you to find out

381
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,020
the place Zhun visited for play

382
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,380
in the several days before he fell ill.

383
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
But you must

384
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,060
keep this matter between us

385
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,300
and mustn't let others know

386
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,540
including Concubine Wen.

387
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,180
Could you promise me?

388
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,540
The garden.

389
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,780
The dog.

390
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,900
I have seen Zhun

391
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,420
stay in the garden alone several times.

392
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,140
But I didn't pay close attention
to that back then.

393
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,180
After you mentioned it to me,

394
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
I especially went to check the garden.

395
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,460
I saw that at the corner of the garden,

396
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,780
there is a dog raised by someone.

397
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,580
I saw Xiuyuan herself

398
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,180
feed the dog.

399
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,260
Xiuyuan?

400
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,540
Yu.

401
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,900
I have something to do.

402
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,380
You could take the pastries and leave.

403
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,900
OK?

404
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,620
Thank you, Mother.

405
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,700
Look after your health, Mother.

406
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,100
Allow me to take leave now.

407
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:22,860
OK.

408
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,580
Let's go.

409
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Garden.

410
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,420
Give the things to me.

411
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,980
(Singing Orioles on the Drooping willows)

412
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,020
I am here to see Shiyi.

413
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,700
Why have you brought me here?

414
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,260
Now Concubine Qiao is in charge
of the family affairs.

415
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,780
If you want to visit Her Ladyship,

416
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,540
you have to ask for

417
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,220
Concubine Qiao's permission first.

418
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,620
Go inside.

419
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,780
Let's go.

420
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,220
I am here to visit Shiyi.

421
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,700
I am her fifth sister.

422
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,900
You Luo sisters

423
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,780
are really close.

424
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,220
Her Ladyship has just been grounded.

425
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,540
Then you came to visit her.

426
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,780
My sister has been grounded?

427
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,380
What for?

428
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,580
Are these for Her Ladyship?

429
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,340
We can hand them over to Her Ladyship.

430
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,660
Xiuyuan, take them.

431
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,140
These are for Shiyi.

432
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,820
How could you be qualified
to hand them over?

433
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,140
I want to see my sister Shiyi in person.

434
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,220
It is not proper for Her Ladyship
to see any outsider now.

435
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,460
Please leave.

436
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,460
I haven't seen her in person.

437
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,300
How could you know it is not proper?

438
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Where is the Marquis?

439
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,860
I want to see and

440
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,180
ask him to reason things out.

441
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,780
How can your Xu Family
treat a guest like this?

442
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,180
What did you say?

443
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,940
Madam.

444
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,500
If His Lordship comes to know this,

445
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,060
I am afraid he will be angry.

446
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,340
Madam, please come with me.

447
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,260
That's more like it.

448
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,580
So, Your Ladyship,

449
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,780
you have asked Yu to make investigations

450
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,460
about where Zhun went for play.

451
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,380
That's because you have
got suspicious, right?

452
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,940
Zhun has been taken good care
of by so many people.

453
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,820
But he still relapsed time and again.

454
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,260
It is really odd.

455
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,940
If we had made investigations rashly,

456
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,660
I am afraid we would not
have been able to

457
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,860
find anything.

458
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,460
Yu actually cares a lot about Zhun.

459
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,540
Besides,

460
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,260
nobody will guard against a child.

461
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,380
So I have entrusted Yu
with the investigation.

462
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,500
Well, as expected,

463
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,220
Yu didn't let you down.

464
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
Now the most important thing

465
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,860
is to find the cause of Zhun's illness.

466
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,860
Then Zhun can be lifted out of danger.

467
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,380
But now you are grounded.

468
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,980
You can't go out.

469
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,180
What should we start our
investigation with?

470
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,660
Shiyi.

471
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,140
Wuniang.

472
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,500
I brought you some bird's nest.

473
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,260
Hurry.

474
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,020
Thank you, sister.

475
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,620
Take a seat, please.

476
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,580
OK.

477
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,900
I heard that Zhun got ill.

478
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,820
So I came to pay a visit.

479
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,940
After I arrived here,

480
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
I was told that you had been grounded.

481
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,540
What happened exactly?

482
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,460
It is a long story.

483
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,300
Wuniang.

484
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,980
Could you please do me a favor?

485
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:58,500
(Rites)

486
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,220
Come on.

487
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,100
Come on, eat more.

488
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,460
When was this dog

489
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,060
placed here?

490
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,940
Have you

491
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,980
brought Zhun here frequently?

492
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,300
I will go take care of Zhun.

493
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,940
Don't leave. Let's get this straight.

494
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,580
Someone, come here!

495
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:46,940
Stop!

496
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,180
Her Ladyship has escaped.

497
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,380
The Great Madam has given
the strict order

498
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,620
to forbid you to go out.

499
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,500
Take her back where she was.

500
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,900
Chase her!

501
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,740
My Lord!

502
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,340
My Lord!

503
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,180
Shiyi.

504
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,300
I have found the exopathogen

505
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,700
that caused Zhun to fall ill.

506
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,460
My Lord.

507
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,620
This dog also has tinea.

508
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,860
If Zhun

509
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,180
has come into contact
with this dog frequently,

510
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,060
the dog must have passed
the exopathogen

511
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
to him.

512
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,540
Great Madam,

513
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,300
someone with evil intentions

514
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,740
must have encouraged Zhun

515
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,300
to play with the dog.

516
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,540
I am to blame for being careless.

517
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,980
I should have paid more
attention to this.

518
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,220
Xiuyuan.

519
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,060
Tell me what happened exactly.

520
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,780
Great Madam, um...

521
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,740
Great Madam,

522
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I gave the dog to Zhun.

523
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,740
It has been kept in the garden

524
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,380
so that Zhun could come to play with it.

525
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,380
But I really don't know that

526
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,620
it has been carrying

527
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,300
the exopathogen.

528
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,540
Now Concubine Qiao

529
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,300
is absolving herself from
all the responsibility.

530
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,780
As I see it, you have tried to

531
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,780
do harm to Zhun purposefully.

532
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,660
Then you shifted the blame for this

533
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,860
onto Her Ladyship.

534
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,540
Dongqing,

535
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,540
how could you behave so rudely?

536
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,460
It is of excellent quality

537
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,780
and is flawless.

538
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,580
Thank you, Mrs Zhou.

539
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,860
This is from Concubine Qiao.

540
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,580
Please thank her on behalf of me.

541
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,660
I am fond of Zhun so much.

542
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,740
I don't have the heart to harm him.

543
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,620
I saw that

544
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,300
Zhun lost his mother

545
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,020
and looked lonely,

546
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,700
so I gave the dog to him

547
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,820
to keep him company.

548
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,500
There is no way for me to know

549
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,580
it has contracted the exopathogen.

550
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,780
Moreover,

551
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,220
Xiuyuan and I also

552
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,220
played with and fed the dog every day.

553
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,620
But we are both all right.

554
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Great Madam, My Lord,

555
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,660
please believe me.

556
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,300
Well, imperial physician,

557
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,540
could you find out

558
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,540
where the exopathogen on the dog's hair

559
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,260
came from?

560
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,980
All things in this world reinforce
and neutralize each other.

561
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,420
I can't give a clear explanation.

562
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,420
Well,

563
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,780
according to Imperial Physician Liu,

564
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,860
Zhun contracted the disease by accident.

565
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,260
Since you don't feel guilty,

566
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,660
why haven't you mentioned it?

567
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,420
And why have you chased
Shiyi in the mansion?

568
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,420
My Lord, I am wronged.

569
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,740
I never mentioned it

570
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,620
because I really didn't realize that

571
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,940
this matter has anything to do
with Zhun's disease.

572
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,300
I chased...

573
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,540
I chased Her Ladyship

574
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,020
because I was afraid that the dog

575
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,260
might bite her.

576
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,820
My Lord,

577
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,980
I swear that

578
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,100
I did all things

579
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,060
without any wicked intentions.

580
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,540
Lingyi,

581
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,300
I have watched Lianfang

582
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,140
since her childhood.

583
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,700
If anyone says she meant to harm Zhun,

584
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,300
I won't believe.

585
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,340
Great Madam.

586
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,140
My Lord.

587
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,260
Though

588
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,340
I didn't do this intentionally,

589
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,780
I must say that

590
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,700
I caused Zhun

591
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,820
to fall ill.

592
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,700
And I put Zhun through

593
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,060
such great suffering.

594
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,260
I have

595
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,900
committed a great sin

596
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,700
and I can't make amends
even if I die 100 times.

597
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,620
If...

598
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,060
If Zhun can't get well,

599
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,020
I won't stay alive.

600
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,820
Enough.

601
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,140
Don't say ominous words about death.

602
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,020
Zhun will recover from illness.

603
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,660
Xiuyuan, help her stand up.

604
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,020
Imperial Physician Liu,

605
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,580
since the cause of illness
has been tracked down,

606
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,260
Zhun can be cured, right?

607
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,860
Zhun has been ill for quite a while

608
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,860
and he has relapsed repeatedly.

609
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,620
So, I am not sure

610
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,620
whether he can tide over this crisis.

611
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,940

May Buddha bless Zhun with
the power to pull through!

624
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,340
Madam, please eat something.

625
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,780
Take it away.

626
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,820
It's all right.

627
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,860
I brought it in secretly.

628
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,060
Nobody saw me.

629
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Even if I was seen,

630
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,740
it will be all right.

631
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,780
Her Ladyship

632
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,180
went out

633
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,340
while she was grounded.

634
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,500
But Great Madam and His Lordship

635
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,780
didn't hold her accountable.

636
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,460
Shut up!

637
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,340
This is different from that.

638
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,780
Why are you still not getting it?

639
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,460
Her Ladyship didn't resist
when she was grounded

640
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,220
because she wanted me to
let my guard down.

641
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,980
Now,

642
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,140
if I can't

643
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,700
make Great Madam and His Lordship

644
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,420
stop suspecting me completely,

645
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,500
I will have no place to put my feet on

646
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,860
in the Xu Family.

647
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,580
Take it away.

648
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,420
Yes, Madam.

649
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,460
May Buddha bless Zhun
with the power to pull through!

650
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,140
Auntie.

651
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,460
Zhun regained consciousness.

652
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Imperial Physician Liu, Zhun came round.

653
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,740
Hurry!

654
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,380
Hurry to check upon him.

655
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,220
I will go notify Great Madam.

656
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
Since Zhun came around,

657
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,540
there is nothing serious with him now.

658
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
He will get well

659
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,820
as long as he rests
quietly to recuperate.

660
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
Thank you, Imperial Physician Liu.

661
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,020
I will prescribe some other
medication for Zhun.

662
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,020
Your Ladyship,

663
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,700
please make Zhun take it as instructed.

664
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,300
I will.

665
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,340
Dongqing, take Imperial Physician Liu
to fetch the medication.

666
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,540
Yes, Your Ladyship.

667
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,420
You are fine now, my darling Zhun.

668
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,300
The physician said that you got well.

669
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
Auntie.

670
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,180
Have you been attending to me

671
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,180
every night these days?

672
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,100
How come you know that?

673
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,620
I heard you singing, auntie.

674
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,580
It is a song that

675
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,380
my mother often sang to me.

676
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,340
Auntie, your hair is so messy

677
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,540
and looks so ugly.

678
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Little brat!

679
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,700
You talked nonsense upon waking up.

680
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,100
I will go tell your father

681
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,300
and ask him to teach you a lesson.

682
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,820
Mother, I said the wrong words.

683
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,060
Don't tell on me in front of father.

684
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,460
I heard Zhun talk.

685
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,660
Zhun came around at last.

686
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,140
Handwriting.

687
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:48,940
Handwriting.

688
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,300
Zhun, your handwriting
has improved a lot.

689
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,220
Good job!

690
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,780
I will find a couple of practice sheets

691
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,220
suitable for you.

692
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,340
Thank you, father.

693
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,420
Zhun has just come around.

694
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,980
His body is still weak.

695
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,620
We'd better not disturb him

696
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,180
and allow him to have a good rest.

697
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,900
Yizhen is right.

698
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,820
We...

699
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,300
Something bad happened, Great Madam.

700
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,620
Concubine Qiao passed out.

701
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
Hurry to tell me what happened.

702
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,620
Concubine Qiao thinks that she
committed a great sin.

703
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,340
So over the last few days,

704
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,340
she has been praying for
Zhun in the Buddha Hall.

705
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,580
To show her sincerity,

706
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,020
she has been fasting and
sleepless all these days

707
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,940
only hoping that the
Goddess of Mercy Guanyin

708
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,460
could bless Zhun.

709
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,780
Well, it is very thoughtful of her

710
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,180
to have been praying for Zhun.

711
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,420
Hurry to rise to your feet.

712
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,820
Go take care of her.

713
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,700
Yes, Great Madam.

714
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,340
Lingyi.

715
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,340
As you can see,

716
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,020
Lianfang has been praying sincerely

717
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,540
for Zhun's sake

718
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,620
and she has got her
body hurt due to fast.

719
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,660
Should you go visit her?

720
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,580
I hope that she really

721
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,340
deserves the love from you, Mother.

722
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,380
Hurry to go visit her.

723
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,820
The imperial physician has said that

724
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,380
Zhun's illness

725
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,820
has nothing to do with Lianfang.

726
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,500
Since the exopathogen has been found

727
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,020
and Lianfang is in bad health,

728
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,580
I will entrust you

729
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,500
to take care of Zhun.

730
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,060
Yes, Mother.

731
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,260
Are you hungry?

732
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,780
Do you want to eat something?

733
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,220
Madam.

734
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,740
His Lordship is here to visit you.

735
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,540
Hurry to help me stand up to dress up.

736
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,100
Greetings to you, My Lord.

737
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,220
You are not feeling well.

738
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,780
Forego these formalities.

739
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,060
It doesn't matter.

740
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,180
Thank you, My Lord.

741
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,500
Over the last few days,

742
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,380
you have been praying for Zhun.

743
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,660
That's really very thoughtful of you.

744
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,660
As long as Zhun can recover from illness

745
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,020
and as long as I can share your burden,

746
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,780
it will be worthwhile for me to do it.

747
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,420
If the fast and prayer can

748
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,420
cure a disease,

749
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,580
what do we need physicians for?

750
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,420
Are you still blaming me, My Lord?

751
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,220
If I had known that

752
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,500
the dog would cause Zhun to fall ill,

753
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,780
surely I would not have given it

754
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,140
to Zhun as a gift.

755
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,500
I was wrong in this matter.

756
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,060
I am willing to accept any punishment.

757
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,020
I only hope that

758
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,420
you can forgive me, My Lord.

759
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,460
Lingyi.

760
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,340
Since Zhun has been out of danger,

761
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,260
I won't carry this matter further.

762
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,540
I won't continue to pursue this matter.

763
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,460
But Mother has a lot of
trust in you all along.

764
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,540
For so many years,

765
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,380
she has been treating you
as her own daughter.

766
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,820
Don't make her sad again.

767
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,780
Do you understand?

768
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,580
Thank you for trusting me, My Lord.

769
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,100
Know your place and
conduct yourself well.

770
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,300
Where is Mrs Liu?

771
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,260
She...

772
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,580
She didn't do her job well
and offended Her Ladyship.

773
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,340
So I drove her out.

774
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,340
It is said that

775
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,140
she has returned to her home
in the countryside.

776
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,260
Back to the countryside?

777
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,580
Where does she come from?

778
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,700
It is said that she comes from Shandong.

779
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,620
About the specific location,
I have no idea.

780
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
Madam, you see now that

781
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,620
His Lordship loves you dearly.

782
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,300
Upon hearing that you passed out,

783
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,820
he hurried to come to check upon you.

784
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,340
Mrs Zhang.

785
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,100
His Lordship asked about
Mrs Liu suddenly.

786
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,300
Do you think that

787
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,580
he has found out something?

788
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,900
Madam.

789
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,340
Don't get yourself scared.

790
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,700
We have paid Mrs Liu

791
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,820
so much money.

792
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,620
She has been long gone from the capital.

793
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,980
Even I don't know her whereabouts.

794
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,100
Madam, don't worry.

795
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,900
Nobody will find out this matter.

796
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,740
Maybe I am just getting paranoid.
