My ancestors.

Yi'er's father

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
and brother died too soon.

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,040
He started to shoulder

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,560
the Xu family's heavy burdens
at a young age.

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,560
He bears too much pressure

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
for the prosperity of the Xu family.

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,200
My ancestors,

if you hear me in heaven,

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,600
please protect Yi'er.

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,400
I hope he'll return soon.

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,320
Great Madam.

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,320
Clues have been found

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,440
to the assassination attempt
against His Lordship.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,760
What did you say?

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,840
Great Madam.

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
I've brought her here.

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Great Madam.

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
Concubine Wen.

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,880
Were you with Lingyi

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,920
when the assassin attacked him?

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,640
I wasn't with him

41
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,560
when the assassin attacked him.

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,560
But someone

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,600
saw you and Concubine Qin

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,560
send Lingyi back

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,960
on the day of the assassination attempt.

46
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,800
We happened

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,440
to find His Lordship injured.

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,800
So we helped him home.

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,120
Is that so?

50
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,520
Bring her in.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Great Madam.

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,760
(Has she confessed?)

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Each of you gives a different statement.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,280
You're obviously lying.

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,390
Tell the truth now

56
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,600
or I'll punish you
according to the family rules.

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,240
Great Madam.

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,200
Spare me, Great Madam.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,640
Great Madam.

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,360
Great Madam, the truth is...

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,680
-Actually.
-Great Madam...

62
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,520
Great Madam, I'll tell you.

63
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
It's Her Ladyship.

64
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,280
Her Ladyship used

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
a pair of scissors to stab

66
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
His Lordship at Xianling Pavilion.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,400
Shiyi?

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
It seems

69
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
they told the truth.

70
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,800
You stabbed Lingyi.

71
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
I am guilty.

72
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,480
Please punish me.

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,400
Did Lingyi treat you badly?

74
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,920
How could you hurt him cruelly?

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
He treated me affectionately.

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,000
I was unfair to him.

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,080
Please punish me.

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,120
I won't have any complaints.

79
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,000
If they hadn't told me

80
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,760
the truth,

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,280
would you've continued
to keep it from me?

82
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,320
I don't understand

83
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,080
why Lingyi
concealed the truth for you.

84
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
Since you care about him,

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
why did you...

86
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,000
Why did you say nothing?

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,040
Why did you let him

88
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,120
risk his life?

89
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,240
I failed him.

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
If anything bad

91
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,040
happens to Lingyi

92
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,680
because of your doing,

93
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,160
I will never forgive you.

94
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,160
Why?

95
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,640
Why did you do this?

96
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
Why did you...

97
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,880
Great Madam.

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,160
Great Madam.

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,240
Is there any news about Lingyi?

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
News broke from the disaster-hit area.

101
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,080
Someone saw that

102
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,920
His Lordship died in a fire

103
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
to save the civilians.

104
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
Great Madam. Great Madam.

105
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,960
Mother.

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,920

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,360

113
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,000
Your Ladyship.

114
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,640
Did he just say

115
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,480
His Lordship died?

116
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,030
Your Ladyship.

117
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,840
Your Ladyship.

118
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,280
Your Ladyship.

119
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,120
Your Ladyship.

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
-Your Ladyship.
-Your Ladyship.

121
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,920
Your Ladyship.

122
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
Lingyi is a great martial artist.

123
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,080
He couldn't have died in a fire.

124
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,440
There must be something wrong.

125
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,040
The Ou familyhas had operations

126
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
in Shandong for so many years.

127
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,640
He must have killed Lingyi.

128
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,280
I'll settle accounts with him right now.

129
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
-Lingkuan.
-Stop.

130
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
The situation is unclear yet.

131
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,640
If His Lordship really died,

132
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
then the whole family depends on you.

133
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,800
If misfortune strikes you

134
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,360
as well,

135
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,680
what will happen to the Xu family?

136
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,560
Lingkuan.

137
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,400
I know

138
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
you and His Lordship
love each other as brothers.

139
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,280
But you need to think for the benefits

140
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
of me and the baby.

141
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm useless.

142
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
I know someone murdered Lingyi.

143
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,480
But I can't do anything.

144
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,240
Yi'er.

145
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,180
Great Madam.

146
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,960
-Mother.
-Mother.

147
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,160
Is my Yi'er

148
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,840
really gone?

149
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
Will he never

150
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,280
come back?

151
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,560
My Yi'er

152
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,800
worked so hard

153
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,480
for his country and family.

154
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,480
But he didn't

155
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
even get to see his family

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,000
before his death.

157
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,240
Why didn't I...

158
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,800
Why didn't I stop him?

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Why didn't I stop him?

160
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,800
Mother.

161
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
The situation is still unclear.

162
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,480
Maybe the news is fake.

163
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
Don't grieve so much.

164
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,000
Take care of yourself.

165
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,480
This is all Luo Shiyi's fault.

166
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,240
My son was a great martial artist.

167
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,120
If she hadn't stabbed him,

168
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,240
he wouldn't have died in a fire.

169
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
Where is Shiyi?

170
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,680
Where is Shiyi?

171
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,560
Go.

172
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,280
Bring her to me.

173
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,760
Mother.

174
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,040
Please don't be emotional.

175
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,840
Calm down, alright?

176
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,640
She conspired with our enemy

177
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,080
and showed her heartless nature.

178
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
She is not to be tolerated.

179
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,040
I want her to pay
for his death with her life.

180
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,000
Mother.

181
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,920
I'm also mad at Shiyi

182
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,480
for stabbing Lingyi.

183
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,960
But I know her well enough

184
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
to assert that she would never

185
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
maliciously conspire with our enemy.

186
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,040
There must be something wrong.

187
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,440
Mother.

188
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,200
Don't do anything impulsive.

189
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,680
Yeah, Mother.

190
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,120
I know you want Shiyi
to pay with her life,

191
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,480
but you can't accuse her
of conspiring with our enemy

192
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,280
without any evidence.

193
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
How will we explain things

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
to the Luo family?

195
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,480
Explain?

196
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,120
The Luo family should
explain things to me.

197
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,840
Every generation of the Xu family

198
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,640
serves in the military.

199
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,240
Family rules are
as serious as military rules.

200
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,240
She injured the head of the family,

201
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,000
which is like killing
the commander before a battle.

202
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,040
I want her to pay
for his death with her life.

203
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,920
Your Ladyship,

204
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,440
what are you doing?

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,320
He survived the perilous battlefield

206
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,720
and came back.

207
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,840
I don't believe he died like this.

208
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,600
Your Ladyship.

209
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,840
Your Ladyship, calm down.

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,400
Your Ladyship,
Shandong is so far from us.

211
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,040
You can't just head there

212
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,240
as a woman.

213
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,600
I must see for myself.

214
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,080
I don't believe he is dead.

215
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,160
But if His Lordship really died,

216
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,080
his body will be sent back

217
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,800
before long.

218
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,560
I don't believe it.

219
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,040
-Your Ladyship.
-Your Ladyship.

220
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Shiyi.

221
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
You must leave as soon as possible.

222
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,400
Mother broke down

223
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,440
after she learned of His Lordship's death.

224
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,880
She wants you to pay
for his death with your life.

225
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,840
She can't solely blame Her Ladyship

226
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,600
for the death of His Lordship.

227
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,680
Mother has lost

228
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
her husband and her son.

229
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,880
She barely survived those tragedies.

230
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
Now she is old,

231
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,640
she can't take

232
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,840
another loss.

233
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,560
It's inevitable that
she'll take extreme measures.

234
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Shiyi,

235
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,680
since His Lordship covered up your action,

236
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,480
I'm sure

237
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,920
there's an explanation for it.

238
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,080
Right now, Mother has lost

239
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,520
her head.

240
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,520
You need to leave

241
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,640
and hide out.

242
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,400
Dongqing, the Divorce Agreement.

243
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Once we show Great Madam

244
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,560
the Divorce Agreement,

245
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,480
she won't be able

246
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,440
to punish you.

247
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Now I see.

248
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,600
His Lordship must have

249
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,400
foreseen this.

250
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,200
So he wrote a Divorce Agreement

251
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,400
(Divorce Agreement)
to protect you.

252
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,640
You're saying His Lordship

253
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,240
wrote a Divorce Agreement
before he left?

254
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,400
Why did you keep it?

255
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,240
I told you to burn it down.

256
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,000
Your Ladyship!

257
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,400
The Divorce Agreement is the only thing

258
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,400
that can save you right now.

259
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,400
Save me?

260
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,160
If he comes back,

261
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
he can do whatever he wants.

262
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
But if he doesn't come back,

263
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,960
I won't live without him.

264
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,960
Burn it down.

265
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,960
Bring Shiyi out.

266
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
Mother.

267
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,080
We haven't got to
the bottom of this matter.

268
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,760
We can't make any rash decision.

269
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,040
It is a fact that Shiyi

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
stabbed the head of the family.

271
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,280
I'm following the family rules.

272
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
What's rash about it?

273
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I don't need your opinion

274
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,840
on this matter.

275
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,520
Luo Shiyi,

276
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
are you convinced?

277
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,400
I treated His Lordship unfairly.

278
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,600
I deserve punishment.

279
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,560
Unfairly?

280
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,560
Lingyi loved you so much.

281
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,200
But you stabbed him.

282
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,000
You even got him killed.

283
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,360
I want you to apologize to him

284
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,600
by dying.

285
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,600
Do you need me to take your life?

286
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,440
Great Madam.

287
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,880
Mother.

288
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,200
I know my crime is serious.

289
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,680
I deserve something
even worse than death.

290
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
But I don't believe he is dead

291
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,200
when I haven't

292
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,120
seen his body.

293
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
Please give me

294
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
some time,

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,520
so I can see him return.

296
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,480
If he is alive,

297
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,120
allow me to repent and apologize to him.

298
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,520
Then you can punish or kill me.

299
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,000
If he is dead,

300
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,320
I'll kill myself

301
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,200
beside his coffin

302
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,600
to apologize.

303
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,160
You don't deserve it.

304
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,880
You don't deserve to see him again.

305
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,110
Mother,

306
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,070
she is right.

307
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,240
Currently, little information about
the situation in Shandong is available.

308
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,480
We don't know what happened.

309
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,000
We mustn't make any decision

310
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,680
before we see His Lordship's body.

311
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,520
Let's wait

312
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,760
for a while.

313
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,600
We can decide how to deal with her

314
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,440
when we've confirmed the news.

315
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,000
Mother,

316
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,560
I know

317
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
the news of Lingyi's death

318
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,040
broke your heart.

319
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
But no matter how angry you are,

320
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,280
please show mercy

321
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,880
for Zhun's sake.

322
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,480
Do you want him

323
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,840
to lose his mother again?

324
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,560
I'll let you

325
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,400
live for a few more days.

326
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,000
Mrs Du,

327
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,360
escort Luo Shiyi

328
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,120
to the farm in the countryside.

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,840
Tell the steward of the farm

330
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,240
that she'll live

331
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,840
in a servant's condition.

332
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,360
Mother.

333
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,400
She stabbed Lingyi.

334
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,480
If you help her secretly,

335
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
then you are against the Xu family.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,120
What did you say?

337
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,840
The Marquis died in a fire?

338
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,160
Is it true?

339
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
The news came from Shandong.

340
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I don't know if it's true.

341
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,960
I am going to visit the Xu family

342
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,280
and inquire about this tomorrow.

343
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,760
There must be some truth to this rumor.

344
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
How is your sister Shiyi?

345
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,320
Shiyi and the Marquis love each other.

346
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,120
If the Marquis is dead,

347
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,120
then I'm afraid

348
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
she won't take the loss well.

349
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,560
The Marquis is the backbone
of the Xu family.

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,840
If he is dead,

351
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
the Xu family will collapse.

352
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,760
Father,

353
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,760
my mother is not in good health.

354
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,640
I plan to keep this from her,

355
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
so she won't worry about this.

356
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,960
You need to visit the Xu family often

357
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,320
these days.

358
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,560
Help them with everything you've got

359
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,920
if you can.

360
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,720
The Luo family and the Xu family
are in-laws.

361
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
If the Xu family collapses,

362
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,960
our family won't stay strong.

363
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,400
Yes, Father.

364
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,120
What's the matter?

365
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,640
Didn't you eat?

366
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,400
Whatever.

367
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,840
You've changed a lot

368
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,080
these days.

369
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm delighted.

370
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,040
I heard that

371
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
Xu Lingyi had an accident.

372
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,320
He is high-ranking and powerful.

373
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,560
What could happen to him?

374
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,400
It's said he had an accident

375
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,720
when he was inspecting
the situation in Shandong.

376
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,920
It seems that he is dead.

377
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,960
Xu Lingyi is dead?

378
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,680
Some people relied on the Xu family

379
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,280
to assume airs.

380
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,400
I'd like to see

381
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
how they end up

382
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
after his death.

383
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,840
If not for Xu Lingyi's influence,

384
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,240
I wouldn't have tolerated you

385
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,240
in the past few days.

386
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,680
Young Madam.

387
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,400
Young Madam.

388
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,080
Did you hear that?

389
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,760
He only treated me nicely

390
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,800
in fear of Xu Lingyi.

391
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,920
I was so foolish

392
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,200
that I thought he'd changed.

393
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,680
Young Madam.

394
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,400
Come on.

395
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,400
Young Madam.

396
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,640
My stomach hurts so much.

397
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,320
Young Madam.

398
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,760
Young Madam.

399
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840
Young Madam.

400
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,760
Servants! Servants!

401
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,360
Servants! Servants!

402
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Is my daughter-in-law truly pregnant?

403
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,480
Physician, are you sure?

404
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,920
Her pulse does indicate pregnancy.

405
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,200
Physician,

406
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,560
my stomach hurt badly earlier.

407
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,680
My baby...

408
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,040
Your pulse shows

409
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,760
that your baby

410
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,000
was already feeble

411
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,840
before you got hurt

412
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,840
and experienced
severe pregnancy complications.

413
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm not completely confident

414
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,080
that I can help her keep the baby.

415
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,160
Physician,

416
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,520
I'll pay

417
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,400
any price

418
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
to keep the baby

419
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
she is carrying.

420
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Don't worry, Madam Wang.

421
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,720
I'll do my best.

422
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,600
You're all here.

423
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,200
Come on. Drink with me.

424
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,320
Mother.

425
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,520
Why did you slap me?

426
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,400
You bastard.

427
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,320
You almost killed

428
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,280
your own child.

429
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,000
You can't let Her Ladyship live here.

430
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,800
Your Ladyship.

431
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm executing Great Madam's order.

432
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,320
It's fine.

433
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
The room is nice.

434
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,600
Who are you?

435
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm the assistant steward of the farm,

436
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,280
Wang Jinzhong.

437
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,960
I manage the internal affairs.

438
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,400
The chief steward is too busy

439
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,320
to come today.

440
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,120
So he asked me

441
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,480
to take care of you.

442
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,040
If you need anything,

443
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
just tell me.

444
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,320
Thank you.

445
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,320
Don't waste time

446
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,520
on them.

447
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,240
She is the matron of Xu family,

448
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,400
yet she has been sent here.

449
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,520
We were ordered

450
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,880
to treat her like a servant.

451
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,400
She must have

452
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,800
done the Xu family wrong.

453
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,520
No need

454
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,840
to be nice to her.

455
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,640
Yes.

456
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
I'll do

457
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,760
as you say.

458
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,960
This place is filthy.

459
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,760
It's not a place

460
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,040
worthy of Her Ladyship.

461
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,520
Her Ladyship is in a bad mood.

462
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,960
Let's not cause her trouble.

463
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,880
Focus

464
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,080
on getting the work done.

465
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,480
I wonder

466
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
where Wan Daxian is

467
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,680
when we're working.

468
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,200
Why isn't he helping us?

469
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,480
I told Wan Daxian to gather information

470
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,160
about the situation in Shandong.

471
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,840
I hope he'll bring good news.

You've finished your work?

494
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,480
Your Ladyship,

495
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,080
how about you take a rest?

496
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
You've been embroidering
for a long time.

497
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,560
What if your eyesight gets damaged?

498
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,840
Yeah.

499
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,480
This oil lamp's light is so dim.

500
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,360
You're going to damage your eyesight.

501
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,520
It's fine.

502
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I just want

503
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,280
to finish this embroidery of

504
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,880
Bodhisattva portrait soon

505
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,160
to bring her blessing to His Lordship.

506
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,120
Amber,

507
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,280
fetch me

508
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,160
the threads for Bodhisattva's hair.

509
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,960
Yes, Your Ladyship.

510
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,480
Your Ladyship.

511
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,560
We've run out of threads.

512
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Great.

513
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,160
Since we've run out of threads,

514
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,680
she can't do any more

515
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,520
embroidery tonight.

516
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,120
She'll have to rest early.

517
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,800
Your Ladyship.

518
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,760
Go to bed now.

519
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
I'll find the assistant steward

520
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,560
and ask him

521
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,840
to get us some threads

522
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,120
tomorrow morning.

523
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,480
Alright.

524
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,800
I'll listen to you

525
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,520
and stop embroidering now.

526
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,480
Amber, hurry up.

527
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,320
Alright.

528
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,400
Wait.

529
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,480
Your Ladyship.

530
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,160
Maybe this will do.

531
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,320
Hold it for me.

532
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,360
I heard from Master Jian that

533
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,040
people have been using hair
to do embroidery

534
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,000
since the Era of Shengyuan

535
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,920
in the Tang Dynasty.

536
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,960
But

537
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,640
I've never tried it before.

538
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,200
I wonder if this will work.

539
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,760
Let me give it a try.

540
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,400
It worked.

541
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,960
Look.

542
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,840
Nice.

543
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,400
This looks even more realistic

544
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,720
than the threads.

545
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,080
Right?

546
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,200
Any news from Steward Bai?

547
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't worry, Mother.

548
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,520
He is on the way.

549
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,120
I'm sure he will

550
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,480
bring back news soon.

551
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,160
I hope they will

552
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,120
bring back good news.

553
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,160
Yizhen.

554
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,840
You'll take charge of the affairs

555
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,720
of the Xu family from tomorrow

556
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,200
and manage the household.

557
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
We must not

558
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,440
panic.

559
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,440
Here is an idea.

560
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,320
Make an inventory

561
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,120
of our lands and shops right away.

562
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,600
Yes, Mother.

563
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,520
I'll make preparations.

564
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,960
Mother,

565
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,520
if Lingyi

566
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,320
really is dead...

567
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,440
Shut up.

568
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,480
Mother.

569
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,880
If he really is dead,

570
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,000
the Ou familywon't let us off.

571
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,800
The Xu family is in danger.

572
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,320
We...

573
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,920
What should we do?

574
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,720
Kuan'er,

575
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
why are you so scared?

576
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,280
Mother.

577
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm not scared.

578
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,040
I'm just worried.

579
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,240
If your brother

580
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,160
never comes back,

581
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,880
then you are the head of the Xu family.

582
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,320
You need to figure out

583
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,560
a way to support this family

584
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,320
because the women and the children

585
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,400
can't shelter you.

586
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,160
Mother,

587
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,240
these things never crossed my mind

588
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,880
when Lingyi was here.

589
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,520
Son,

590
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,680
misfortune once

591
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,400
struck the Xu family.

592
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,560
Your father and brother died suddenly.

593
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,480
Then Lingyi

594
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,800
joined the army at a young age

595
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,920
to protect the family.

596
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,720
He risked his life on the battlefield.

597
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,520
He barely escaped death.

598
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,240
He barely escaped death.

599
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,600
He was even younger than you are now

600
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,040
at that time.

601
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,760
But he single-handedly supported

602
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,120
the whole Xu family.

603
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,960
Did you ever see him

604
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
hesitate or frighten?

605
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,800
I'm useless.

606
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,720
I've disappointed you.

607
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,720
Kuan'er,

608
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,080
you might never

609
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,120
be brave and decisive as Lingyi.

610
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
But you

611
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,200
must not lose

612
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,920
the Xu family's spirit.

613
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
No matter what awaits us,

614
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,320
the Xu family cannot

615
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,440
lose its backbone.

616
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,600
Keep it in mind.

617

(Firmiana Rain
written by Bai Pu)

(The Oil Seller and the Song Girl
Volume I)

619
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,240
Let heaven be the witness

620
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,400
to my vow:

621
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
I'll never engage

622
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,720
in operas again.

623
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
If Lingyi is dead,

624
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,480
then I'll go out of my way

625
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,400
to protect the Xu family.

626
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,720
Father,

627
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,000
now that Xu Lingyi is dead

628
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,920
and the other officials
at the Ministry of Revenue

629
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,080
don't have much influence,

630
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,720
our crisis in Shandong is over.

631
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,440
We can

632
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,200
blame Xu Lingyi

633
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,520
for our people's

634
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,880
misdeeds in Shandong.

635
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,520
Xu Lingyi...

636
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,400
Is Xu Lingyi really dead?

637
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,280
Rest easy, Father.

638
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,200
My people

639
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,680
saw Xu Lingyi's scorched body

640
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,640
for confirmation.

641
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,840
There was no mistake.

642
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,880
This is the wolf tally.

643
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,680
Take it.

644
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,520
It can order

645
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,120
our secret followers in Shandong

646
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,520
and help you do things.

647
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
You've completed your task well

648
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,720
this time.

649
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,440
But don't be impatient.

650
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,920
You still need to act
cautiously in the future.

651
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,240
Thank you for trusting me, Father.

652
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,560
I'll keep your advice

653
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,680
in mind.

654
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,560
I won't let you down.

655
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,680
You may go.

656
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,880
Yes, Father.

657
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,960
Mr. Ou.

658
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,600
Mr. Ou.

659
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,120
I have bad news.

660
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,520
Shiyi has gone missing.

661
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,720
Missing?

662
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,280
Why has she gone missing?

663
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,080
I just went to the Mansion of Xu

664
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,320
to see Shiyi.

665
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,960
But the servants said

666
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,600
Shiyi offended Great Madam.

667
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,360
So Great Madam

668
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,760
sent her away in a carriage.

669
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,360
I asked where she was sent.

670
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,680
But they knew nothing.

671
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,520
No.

672
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,200
The Xu family must have found out

673
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,080
that Shiyi had stabbed Marquis Yongping

674
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
after he died.

675
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,560
They did this to punish Shiyi.

676
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,360
Did you say Marquis Yongping died?

677
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
Is it true?

678
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,600
I heard it on the grapevine.

679
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,880
I didn't believe it

680
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,880
until I went home and verified it.

681
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,320
I came here

682
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,640
out of worry for Shiyi.

683
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,920
That's bad.

684
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
That means

685
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,560
Shiyi is really in danger

686
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,320
this time.

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,920
Take it easy.

688
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,480
Marquis Yongping is gone.

689
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
But we can protect her.

690
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,160
I'll gather my people

691
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,120
to search for her.

692
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,640
I'll make sure she stays safe.

693
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:22,960
Alright.

694
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,240
Then I'll trust you

695
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,200
with this matter.

696
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:26,960
Don't worry.

697
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,200
I won't let harm come to her.

698
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,480
Keep her safe, please.

699
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,440
Your Ladyship.

700
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,680
That chief steward

701
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,280
asserts his superior's authority

702
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,680
to torture you in every way.

703
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,880
Maybe we should quit

704
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,920
and leave.

705
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
No.

706
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,760
If I leave now,

707
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,640
we'll never get to return
to the Xu family.

708
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,720
I can't leave.

709
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,000
Your Ladyship.

710
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,600
How about you take a rest?

711
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,280
You've done so much work.

712
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,800
Don't tire yourself out.

713
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm fine.

714
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,240
Don't worry about me.

715
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,600
I can hold on.

716
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,920
Let's hurry up

717
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,200
and get the job done.

718
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,880
Who is that?

719
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,120
Stop!

720
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,800
Is anyone there?

721
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,240
Help!

722
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,040
Dongqing!

723
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,480
Dongqing, did you hear

724
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
any sounds?

725
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,680
Help!

726
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,480
I think that's Her Ladyship's voice.

727
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,040
Your Ladyship?

728
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,120
Dongqing! Amber!

729
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Your Ladyship!

730
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,000
Are you alright?

731
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,840
What happened?

732
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,000
I can't believe a thief
lurks on this shabby farm.

733
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
Oh, no.

734
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,440
Your Ladyship.

735
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,000
Nothing is lost.

736
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,280
He couldn't have been a thief.

737
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,280
A thief

738
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,720
would have stolen stuff.

739
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,640
Besides,

740
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,040
he pushed Her Ladyship into a well.

741
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,920
He obviously wanted her dead.

742
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,640
Your Ladyship,

743
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
did you see

744
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,640
the face of the person

745
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,920
who pushed you into the well?

746
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,560
He pushed me from behind.

747
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,760
I didn't see him clearly.

748
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,840
But why did he try to kill me?

749
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,120
Anyway, we must be more careful

750
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,760
from now on.

751
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,720
Your Ladyship, we should tell

752
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,600
the chief steward about this.

753
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,640
I don't think telling him

754
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,640
would change anything.

755
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,400
Her Ladyship is right.

756
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,200
The chief steward

757
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,440
is black-hearted.

758
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,720
He works for Great Madam.

759
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,600
Maybe

760
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,440
he pushed Her Ladyship into the well.

761
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,960
Dongqing,

762
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,960
we mustn't stay away

763
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,040
from Her Ladyship in the future.

764
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,760
We mustn't
let that person succeed again.

765
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,560
This place?

766
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,720
Are you sure this is the place?

767
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,960
How come you still haven't

768
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,560
finished washing these few clothes?

769
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,160
Chief steward,

770
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,600
an accident happened...

771
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,520
-So...
-There was no accident.

772
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,920
You've just been slacking off.

773
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,000
You can't even finish

774
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,360
this small amount of work in time.

775
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,760
No wonder Great Madam
kicked you out.

776
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,520
Be clear that

777
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,520
this is not

778
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,840
a place of comfort.

779
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,800
Chief steward,

780
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,320
if I'm not mistaken,

781
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,680
you're in charge

782
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,000
of the fields, hills and forests.

783
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,800
The assistant steward

784
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,720
should be in charge
of the internal affairs.

785
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,680
I...

786
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,360
I'm the chief steward.

787
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,880
Of course I have the right

788
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,280
to manage
the assistant steward's affairs.

789
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,640
Assistant steward,

790
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,440
is that true?

791
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,680
The chief steward is right.

792
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,640
Although I manage this house,

793
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,040
the chief steward manages

794
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,560
the whole farm,

795
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400
including me.

796
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
You heard him.

797
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,480
By the way,

798
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,520
your punishment is to fill

799
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,200
all the water tanks on this farm today.

800
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,240
You're going too far, I'm warning you.

801
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,760
I'll come and check
the water tanks tomorrow.

802
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,600
If you fail to fill them,

803
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,400
I'll continue to punish you.

804
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:13,920
You...

805
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,320
Dongqing.

806
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,640
Let me do it.

807
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,080
We've been working for so long.

808
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,800
When can it be done?

809
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
You must be exhausted.

810
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,080
Let's get inside and rest.

811
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,320
Drink some water
before we come out again.

812
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,480
Alright.

813
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,720
Come on.

814
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,320
Your Ladyship.

815
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,160
I'll just have a little nap.

816
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,240
Your Ladyship, I'll have a little nap too.

817
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,080
Thank you for working so hard.

818
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,120
I can't go on, Young Master.

819
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,160
I'm exhausted.

820
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,520
We've never done

821
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,840
this kind of heavy physical work.

822
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,080
No.

823
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,840
We must finish the work

824
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,600
before she wakes up.

825
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,040
Alright.

826
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,480
Hurry up.

827
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,000
Dongqing.

828
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,240
Amber.

829
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,520
Wake up.

830
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,520
Your Ladyship.

831
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,040
Your Ladyship, look.

832
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,960
All the tanks are full.

833
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,640
This is amazing, Your Ladyship.

834
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,560
I just checked all the water tanks

835
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,960
on the farm.

836
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,160
All of them are full.

837
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,080
I got it.

838
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,280
The immortals in heaven

839
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,560
must have frowned upon them
for bullying you.

840
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,200
So the immortals

841
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,440
filled the tanks overnight for us.

842
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,080
That must be the thing.

843
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,240
I think so.
