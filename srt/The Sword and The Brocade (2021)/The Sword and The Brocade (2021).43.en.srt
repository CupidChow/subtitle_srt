In the final analysis, it's my fault.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
If I refused to take her

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
as a concubine resolutely back then

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,240
and didn't put her
to the test intentionally,

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
she might still

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,720
be alive.

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,360
My Lord,

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,720
nobody can foretell things.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,640
You are not to blame for this.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
I was not in love with them.

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
But I accepted them as my concubines

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,800
for various reasons

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,240
and caused all these tragedies.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,440
All these things

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,440
are not up to you.

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,240
You can't force yourself

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,720
to love them.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,160
But I believe that

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,120
you have done your best

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,240
to take care of them.

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
The only thing I can do now

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,520
is to bury her decently.

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
My Lord, don't worry.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,360
I will arrange personnel

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,360
to handle Concubine Qin's
funeral affairs properly.

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
She has given up her grudges in the end.

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,480
So I am sure that she can rest in peace.

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
My Lord,

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,920
do you think

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
Marquis Jingyuan will believe

49
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,320
the message from Concubine Qin?

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,120
Whether he believes it or not,

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,800
he will no longer trust Wang Jiubao.

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
We can't

53
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,720
keep Wang Jiubao anymore.

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,600
Though we have been
holding his wife and son as hostages,

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,520
we have been cooperating
for so many years

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,000
and have had our separate needs met.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,640
He didn't suffer losses.

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,200
Normally, he shouldn't
have betrayed us suddenly.

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,600
If this is Xu Lingyi's stratagem
of sowing discord,

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,840
your suspicion of Wang Jiubao

61
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,760
will play into his hands.

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,800
The imperial court has been offering
enlistment to Wang Jiubao

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,800
since a long time ago.

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,160
Wang Jiubao is fully aware that

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,070
accepting the enlistment
by the imperial court

66
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,680
will lead to unpredictable risks.

67
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,000
Surely, he won't surrender easily.

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,960
The problem now is
that Shen Niang and her son

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,800
must have been brought to Wang Jiubao

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,800
by Xu Lingyi.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,160
Even if this is just Xu Lingyi's

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,880
stratagem of sowing discord,

73
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,640
we have to be on guard.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,960
It is better to take the initiative
to gain the upper hand

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,120
than to be at a passive disadvantage.

76
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,680
If Wang Jiubao wants to

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,960
save his own skin,

78
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,920
he will have no choice,

79
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,360
but to pledge allegiance
to the imperial court.

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,480
Then I guess you must have
made relevant arrangements.

81
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,400
I have sent personnel to Fujian

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,080
to remind Wang Jiubao
to take preventive measures.

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
Linbo has also been
assisting them in secret.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
There is no way for Marquis Jingyuan
to accomplish his end.

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,940
(Rites)

86
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,020
(Rites)

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
Dongqing.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,680
Why are you here?

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,080
Have you had the hairpin fixed?

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,120
I have told you

91
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,240
I want it to be
as intact as a new one, haven't I?

92
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,320
This hairpin has such obvious cracks.

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
It is clear that you are not sincere.

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
Dongqing.

95
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,200
I caused the cracks

96
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,800
to this hairpin.

97
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
But the cracks of my heart

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,120
were caused by you.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Why are you so cheeky

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,400
to say such cheesy words?

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,160
Dongqing.

102
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Please stop torturing me.

103
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,560
I want you to marry me.

104
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
I will spend the rest of my life

105
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,280
to mend the cracks of this hairpin,

106
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,200
all right?

107
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,360
Do you sincerely want me to marry you?

108
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,800
Of course I do.

109
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
Except you,

110
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,800
I don't want to marry

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,000
any other woman.

112
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,080
If you don't marry me,
I will become a monk.

113
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,320
I don't want you to be a monk.

114
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,120
Does this mean
that you said yes to my proposal?

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,440
I didn't say that.

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,280
I didn't find

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,280
you are so thick-skinned till now.

118
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,320
This is nothing.

119
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,760
For you,

120
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
I am even willing to die.

121
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,440
Don't talk nonsense!

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,200
It is late now.

123
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,840
I will be off.

124
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,980
(Rites)

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,160
Give this back to me.

126
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,880
Your Ladyship,

127
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
I am leaving for Fujian.

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,080
Before I leave,

129
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,360
I want to tell you something

130
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
that has been on my mind all along.

131
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,560
If not, I will not be able to leave
with peaceful mind.

132
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
I want to

133
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,320
request you to allow me
to marry Dongqing.

134
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,800
Dongqing.

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,480
Are you willing to marry Linbo?

136
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
It seems that Dongqing
is not willing to.

137
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,320
Then I think we'd better drop it.

138
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,040
Your Ladyship,
I didn't say I am not willing to.

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,040
I am willing to marry him.

140
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,320
A grown girl can't be kept by your side.

141
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,200
Then I will

142
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,120
give my consent to your marriage.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,760
Thank you, Your Ladyship!

144
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,760
Thank you, Your Ladyship!

145
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,120
From now on,

146
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,720
you must treat Dongqing nicely.

147
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Linbo is leaving for Fujian.

148
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
So today I will grant you a leave.

149
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,920
And you should bid
farewell to him properly.

150
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,560
Yes, Your Ladyship.

151
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
Go do your things now.

152
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,360
Well,

153
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,120
if I hadn't been forced to stay at home,

154
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,760
I would not have noticed

155
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,520
such beautiful scenery in our house.

156
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,000
You have watched them for quite a while.

157
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,440
Now go inside to have a rest.

158
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,040
Our baby is growing heavier
in your tummy.

159
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,080
So it is not good for you
to stand for long.

160
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,280
Let's go.

161
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Let's go inside.

162
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Sit down.

163
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,440
Come on.

164
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,480
Taste this bowl of

165
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,120
ewe's milk and Chinese yam congee.

166
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,600
We are not rich.

167
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
After I give birth to the baby,

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,240
we will need more money to spend.

169
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,360
You shouldn't have spent money

170
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,840
buying such luxurious stuff.

171
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,080
Shiyi sent someone

172
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
to bring the ewe's milk

173
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,200
early in the morning.

174
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,000
The Chinese yam didn't cost much.

175
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,440
If you like it,

176
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,080
we can afford it.

177
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,960
I will be right back.

178
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,520
Master Qian.

179
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,560
What is the matter?

180
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
Is it that we are running out of money?

181
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,560
I am afraid that our money
will be used up in a few days.

182
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
I have prepared
Her Ladyship's three meals

183
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,760
as you ordered.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
Now Her Ladyship is going to
give birth to a baby soon.

185
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,000
It is inevitable that
our daily expenses have increased.

186
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,080
It is not time for the farm
to harvest crops.

187
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
So we are spending money
without earning any.

188
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,840
I didn't expect that

189
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,640
we would not be able to make ends meet.

190
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Should I

191
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,360
go to the Xu family to borrow some money

192
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,880
from Madam Xu again?

193
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,120
You can't lift someone out
of chronic poverty.

194
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,920
It is not a good way in the long run

195
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,560
to always depend on
the Xu family and the Luo family.

196
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,000
I am to blame.

197
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
I am a useless scholar
who can't support his family.

198
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,160
Take this silver.

199
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,720
You mustn't

200
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,320
let Wuniang know this matter.

201
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,720
Or she will worry.

202
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,480
Whatever she likes to eat,

203
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,680
you should buy them for her.

204
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,360
As for the money,

205
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,400
I will manage to bring it home.

206
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,160
OK.

207
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,320
Come to have a look!

208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,880
Qian Ming.

209
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,240
Zhiyuan.

210
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,840
Why are you here?

211
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
I am going to your house to see you.

212
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,640
You want to see me?

213
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
What is the matter?

214
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
It is something great!

215
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,760
Luck will turn in your favor.

216
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,160
How about this?

217
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,240
I will give you a treat.

218
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,360
Let's talk as we drink.

219
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:31,880
How do you like this idea?

220
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,000
After you!

221
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,200
You first.

222
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,920
A few days ago, an elder brother of mine

223
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,800
just returned from the south.

224
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,520
He said he has some old acquaintances

225
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,160
in the south.

226
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
They are engaged in
the embroidery business.

227
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,400
They need lots of embroideries.

228
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,520
I learned previously that

229
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,440
you have a relative

230
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,680
who runs an embroidery workshop.

231
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
So after hearing this news,

232
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,880
I came to see you immediately.

233
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,120
It is true.

234
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,320
My sister-in-law

235
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
is running an embroidery workshop
with a partner.

236
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,280
Well,

237
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
since she is such a close relative,

238
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
it will be an easy thing.

239
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,120
You don't know, Qian Ming.

240
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,880
The southerners

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,480
are very generous in business.

242
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,320
As long as a deal is closed,

243
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,080
the profits will be handsome.

244
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,720
If you can have
a share of them more or less,

245
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,000
you will have enough to spend
in the coming two years.

246
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,040
Really?

247
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,440
Of course.

248
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,160
Then it is really a great chance.

249
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,120
You can't afford to
let this chance slip.

250
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,640
Many people

251
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,680
will scramble for such a chance.

252
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
The earlier, the better.

253
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
If you can make up your mind now,

254
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,160
Qian Ming,

255
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,400
I will go back right now

256
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
to settle this matter
with my brother.

257
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,440
OK.

258
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,920
Today I will go to see my sister-in-law

259
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
to talk about this matter.

260
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,400
Zhiyuan.

261
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,180
(Xianling Pavilion)

262
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
As long as you two agree,

263
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,440
I will handle the other matters.

264
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,240
Of course, it is a great thing

265
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,160
to be able to expand
our Xianling Pavilion's business

266
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,080
to the south.

267
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
If we can really conclude this deal,

268
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,320
we will not only

269
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,680
let the name of our Xianling Pavilion
known by more people,

270
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
but also bring benefits to
more embroidery girls.

271
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,320
Why not go ahead with it?

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,560
The only problem is that

273
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,640
now our Xianling Pavilion
is not large-scaled enough.

274
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,920
I am afraid we are not capable of

275
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,120
producing as many embroideries as
specified by the order

276
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,200
in a short time.

277
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,320
We are thinking about scaling up

278
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,040
our Xianling Pavilion, right?

279
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,600
Why don't we take this chance

280
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,320
to set up a branch in Yuhang?

281
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,800
I know some embroidery girls

282
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,360
over there.

283
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,800
I can ask them to help us

284
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,560
to recruit highly-skilled
embroidery girls

285
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,200
among the folks.

286
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,240
In this way,

287
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,480
we will have no problem

288
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,040
closing this deal.

289
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
This is a great idea!

290
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,160
OK.

291
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
Let's do it this way.

292
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,680
We have to trouble you to work
as the middleman.

293
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,360
It's my pleasure, Shiyi.

294
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
This matter shouldn't be delayed.

295
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,960
I will go see my friend right now

296
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,120
to nail this matter down.

297
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
Wait for my news, you two.

298
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,560
Take care on your way.

299
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,480
Be seated, Shiyi.

300
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,240
These days

301
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,080
Wuniang is

302
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,520
in great need of money.

303
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,480
If we can succeed in this deal,

304
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,560
her shortage of money
will be less serious.

305
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,800
You are so nice

306
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,120
to care so much about your sister.

307
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,120
Nonetheless,

308
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,760
it is also a very good thing

309
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,480
for Xianling Pavilion.

310
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,760
Now we should
start making preparations for

311
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,160
opening up a branch.

312
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,680
We will be very busy in the coming days.

313
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
You will be happy doing things you like

314
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,600
no matter how busy you are.

315
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,080
Exactly.

316
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,680
I am thinking that

317
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,720
after we open up the branch in Yuhang

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
and conclude this deal,

319
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,040
we should set up more branches

320
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,600
in more places

321
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,680
to spread the craft of

322
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,880
our Xianling Pavilion.

323
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,080
Maybe

324
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,040
we will be able to help more people.

325
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,560
Behave yourselves!

326
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,640
Did you hear?

327
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,680
Don't move!

328
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,680
What are you doing?

329
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,200
Sit down! What are you doing?

330
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,300
(Transaction Documents)

331
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,360
Report!

332
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,840
In the wooden cases, we found

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,480
loads of embroideries from
Xianling Pavilion of the capital.

334
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,680
We also searched them and

335
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,480
found the transaction documents

336
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,320
of Xianling Pavilion.

337
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,860
(Transaction Documents)

338
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,920
Report this matter to
the imperial court immediately.

339
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,160
Yes!

340
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,720
Fujian Administration Commission

341
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,480
submitted a memorial
to the imperial court.

342
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,800
It says that

343
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,840
Xianling Pavilion of the capital

344
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,720
is found to collude with
the pirates in smuggling

345
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
and selling embroideries abroad

346
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,000
without permission to make profits.

347
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,600
Both witnesses and material evidence
have been obtained.

348
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
His Majesty got enraged
after reading the memorial

349
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,640
and gave the order

350
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,520
to have Xianling Pavilion seized.

351
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,760
And His Majesty has designated
the three judicial offices

352
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,640
to investigate this case thoroughly.

353
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,200
Grand Secretary,

354
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,680
could there be any
kind of misunderstanding?

355
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,520
Though I have no knowledge about

356
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,040
Xianling Pavilion's operation model,

357
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,160
I am sure that

358
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,110
it has never colluded with the pirates.

359
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,680
Grand Secretary.

360
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,110
Xianling Pavilion

361
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,350
is the property
of Marquis Yongping's wife.

362
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,840
I humbly think that

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,040
Marquis Yongping should

364
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,760
be required to stay out of this case.

365
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,400
Grand Secretary.

366
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
When smuggling is rampant,

367
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
the imperial court will
be short of sources of tax revenue.

368
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,360
It is like a human
who lacks vital energy and blood.

369
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,840
Such an illegal act undermining
the foundation of our state

370
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,120
calls for severe punishment.

371
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,280
Therefore, His Majesty has
issued an imperial edict

372
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,760
to pick up the owner
of Xianling Pavilion.

373
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,840
Marquis Yongping.

374
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,200
This matter concerns the foundation
of our state.

375
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,480
You mustn't bend the laws for your wife.

376
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,760
Go inside!

377
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,640
Hurry!

378
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,160
Who is the owner here?

379
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,320
Officer.

380
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,840
I am the owner of Xianling Pavilion.

381
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
What is this for, officer?

382
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,680
Xianling Pavilion
colluded with the pirates

383
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,280
to smuggle embroideries.

384
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,600
All of you

385
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,640
must come with us.

386
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,760
Whoever resists

387
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
will be killed.

388
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,240
Well,

389
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,160
could there be
any misunderstanding in this?

390
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,000
Do you know

391
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,960
this is the property
of Marquis Yongping's wife.

392
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,800
She can't help you.

393
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
She herself will be apprehended too.

394
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,440
Take them away!

395
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,000
You!

396
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
You can't catch people arbitrarily!

397
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,720
-Officer!
-Officer!

398
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,280
Master Jian.

399
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,680
Could there be any misunderstanding?

400
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,280
Officer!

401
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,480
Master Jian,

402
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,440
please go.

403
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,540
(Mansion of Xu)

404
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,940
(A fair place
produces outstanding people.)

405
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,600
Marquis.

406
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,600
-My Lord.
-Shiyi.

407
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,080
Please forgive us, Marquis.

408
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,800
We are doing our job by order.

409
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
Have they hurt you?

410
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
I am fine.

411
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,400
My Lord, I didn't...

412
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,240
I know.

413
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,760
Believe me.

414
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,400
I am with you.

415
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
I won't let you be wronged.

416
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
Listen up, all of you!

417
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,200
There is still no verdict on this case.

418
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,000
If anyone dares to hurt my wife a bit...

419
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,760
Marquis,

420
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,560
we dare not hurt Madam Xu.

421
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,480
Madam Xu,

422
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,000
please come with us.

423
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,660
(Mansion of Xu)

424
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,600
What should we do?

425
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,560
Wuniang! Wuniang!

426
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,640
Wuniang!

427
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,980
(Virtue of Purity and Nobility)

428
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,800
Wuniang!

429
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,040
Wuniang!

430
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
What's troubling you?

431
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,840
Why are you so panic-stricken?

432
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
Xianling Pavilion was accused of
colluding with pirates

433
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,320
to smuggle embroideries.

434
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,440
It has been seized.

435
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,880
What?

436
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,400
I went to see Qin Zhiyuan just now.

437
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:32,960
Someone said that

438
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,680
he had been promoted to
an official position of Fujian.

439
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,040
He has no scholarly honor
or official rank.

440
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,280
Theoretically,
this shouldn't have happened.

441
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,440
I am afraid,

442
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,600
I am afraid that Marquis Jingyuan

443
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,320
used me with the help of Qin Zhiyuan.

444
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,660
(Virtue of Purity and Nobility)

445
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,420
-Come!
-Hurry to go to the Xu family

446
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,960
to see Marquis Yongping!

447
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
Take away Qian Ming.

448
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,480
What is going on?

449
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,800
Hurry to go to the Xu family
to see Marquis Yongping!

450
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
Hurry to go to the Xu family
to see Marquis Yongping!

451
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,280
Why are they arresting you?

452
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Hurry to go to the Xu family
to see Marquis Yongping!

453
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,520
Hurry up!

454
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,400
Your Ladyship.

455
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,800
Your Ladyship, are you all right?

456
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
What should we do, Your Ladyship?

457
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,800
The Xu family.

458
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,600
Let's go to the Xu family.

459
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,320
Your Ladyship, be careful.

460
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,580
(Mansion of Xu)

461
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
It is true that Qian Ming acted
as the go-between

462
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
in the trade of the batch of
confiscated embroideries.

463
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,800
But he said that

464
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,080
he had fallen into
Marquis Jingyuan's trap.

465
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
And Marquis Jingyuan cheated him

466
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,680
with the help of
his classmate Qin Zhiyuan.

467
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,960
Marquis Jingyuan.

468
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
It is his scheme again!

469
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,640
My Lord, Duke Wei is here.

470
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Duke.

471
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,560
How are things now?

472
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,080
I have sent personnel to check it out.

473
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,000
Now the evidence obtained
by the Ministry of Justice

474
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
is the embroideries of Xianling Pavilion

475
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,720
and the transaction documents
as well as seals.

476
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,600
The witnesses are the pirates
caught on the spot.

477
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,360
The testimony of the pirates proves that

478
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,760
Xianling Pavilion has really
got involved in smuggling.

479
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,160
The evidence is conclusive.

480
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,960
What is His Majesty's attitude
toward this?

481
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,800
I am afraid that His Majesty
has got suspicious of you.

482
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,840
So he ordered the three judicial offices
to try this case jointly

483
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,440
and make strict
investigations pursuant to laws.

484
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
But there are still a few days to go

485
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,520
before the joint trial of
the three judicial offices starts.

486
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,280
We still have a chance
to find out the truth.

487
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,040
Then,

488
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,880
then Qin Zhiyuan
will be a crucial factor.

489
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,240
But he is in the faraway Fujian now.

490
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,240
I am worried that we won't be able to

491
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,640
find him before the joint trial starts.

492
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,920
I have contacts in Fujian.

493
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,960
I will ask them to find Qin Zhiyuan.

494
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,280
I must have him brought to the capital

495
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,800
even if resorting to kidnapping.

496
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,720
My husband and I are to blame for this.

497
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,800
We caused Shiyi to

498
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,040
fall into the bad person's trap.

499
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
Marquis,

500
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,440
my husband did this to

501
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
feed and clothe our baby and me.

502
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,160
If not so, as a scholar,

503
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,360
he wouldn't have engaged in business.

504
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,240
He didn't do such a thing purposefully.

505
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,800
I know.

506
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,920
I will definitely get them out
of the prison.

507
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,040
Don't worry.

508
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,640
Thank you, Marquis!

509
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,360
It is the prison.

510
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,000
How could Shiyi

511
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,240
put up with

512
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,440
the sunless and fettered days in it?

513
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,720
Might she suffer corporal punishment

514
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,400
in it?

515
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,960
Thinking of this,

516
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,000
I feel short of breath

517
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,200
due to worry.

518
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,560
Don't worry too much, Mother.

519
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,640
I will manage to visit Shiyi.

520
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,400
With I being Shiyi's husband,

521
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,080
I bet they dare not act recklessly.

522
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,360
Our Xu family

523
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,680
has always been sticking to
integrity and uprightness.

524
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,240
How come Shiyi got framed

525
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,120
for smuggling inexplicably?

526
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,440
It is obvious that Marquis Jingyuan

527
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,360
tried to hurt us.

528
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,800
Even if we keep lying at home,

529
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,280
trouble will come to us.

530
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
The Ou family

531
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,680
has been eyeing us menacingly

532
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,600
and trying to
undermine our power all along.

533
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,520
They went too far in bullying us!

534
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,320
Sooner or later,

535
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,480
we have to settle our accounts
with the Ou family.

536
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,600
But I feel sad to see Shiyi suffer.

537
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,280
I have sent people to
investigate this case

538
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,440
and to look for evidence.

539
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,360
I believe that in a few days,

540
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,200
news will come.

541
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,560
Marquis Jingyuan is a sly fox.

542
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,600
Whatever it takes, I will not

543
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,920
allow his conspiracy to succeed.

544
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,120
(Prison)
You can't go in,

545
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,800
Marquis Yongping.

546
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,960
Please don't make it hard for me.

547
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,800
What's your motive for

548
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,200
forbidding my lord

549
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,440
to see his wife?

550
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,680
Marquis Yongping.

551
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,640
Official Li.

552
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,440
I want to go in to visit my wife.

553
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
Please bend the rules a bit.

554
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
I can understand your feelings,

555
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,960
but this case involves you,
Marquis Yongping.

556
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,120
Please think twice.

557
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,960
Such being the case,

558
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,360
I will not make it hard
for you, Official Li.

559
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,640
But I request you

560
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,960
to be impartial and just as usual

561
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,360
and distinguish
between truth and falsehood

562
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,760
when you try this case.

563
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,120
That is the working style of
our Ministry of Justice all the time.

564
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,400
You need not worry, Marquis Yongping.

565
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,560
I am wronged!

566
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,440
-Hurry! Hurry!
-I am wronged.

567
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,680
Go inside!

568
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,300
(Prison Guard)

569
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,400
Move quickly!

570
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,400
Hurry up!

571
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,920
Go inside!

572
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,560
I wonder where my brother-in-law

573
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,520
and our embroidery girls

574
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
are imprisoned.

575
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,960
I am sorry to have implicated you.

576
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,440
This is not your fault.

577
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,880
Don't mind it.

578
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Something must have gone wrong.

579
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,480
Our Xianling Pavilion

580
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,200
has never done any illegal things.

581
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,960
As long as the truth of
this case is revealed,

582
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,240
we will be set free.

583
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,160
I am afraid that
this matter is not so simple.

584
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,160
As is known to all,

585
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,840
I am the owner of Xianling Pavilion.

586
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,720
If they don't have solid evidence,

587
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,520
how did they dare to do this to us?

588
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,920
Well.

589
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,760
You mean that...

590
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,440
I am afraid that this deal

591
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,760
is a conspiracy

592
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,440
against me

593
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,120
and our Xu family.

594
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,760
Could...

595
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,440
Teacher.

596
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,000
If they ask you,

597
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,160
you only need to say that

598
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,480
I handle this matter all by myself

599
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,840
and you know nothing about it.

600
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,740
(Prison Guard)

601
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,880
The minister will
interrogate the prisoner.

602
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
You, come out!

603
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Remember what I said.

604
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Shiyi!

605
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,080
Shiyi!

606
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,220
(Prisoner)

607
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Luo Shiyi.

608
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,120
Xianling Pavilion

609
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,720
smuggled embroideries
into overseas countries.

610
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,840
Who is behind this?

611
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,480
Did you act on Xu Lingyi's instigation?

612
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,680
I have told you that

613
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,320
I have been doing legitimate business

614
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,720
and haven't got involved in smuggling.

615
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,120
My husband

616
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,560
has never had a hand in

617
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,760
any affairs of Xianling Pavilion.

618
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Official, I don't know

619
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,200
what purpose you want to achieve

620
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,680
by charging my husband

621
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,320
with such a crime.

622
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,200
Mind your words!

623
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,640
In the smuggling ship,

624
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
the embroideries of
Xianling Pavilion were found.

625
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,440
Also, the pirates testified that

626
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,840
they did business with you

627
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,360
with Qian Ming being the middleman.

628
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,120
Now we have both
witnesses and material evidence.

629
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,040
How dare you still resort to sophistry!

630
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,920
You are the wife of Marquis Yongping.

631
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,040
How could he

632
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,920
stay aloof from this?

633
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,120
Hurry to confess.

634
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,000
Someone has framed me deliberately.

635
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,480
Official, please judge wisely.

636
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,160
Total rubbish!

637
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,160
Marquis Jingyuan is here.

638
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,540
(Prison Guard)

639
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,380
(Prisoner)

640
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,640
What has brought you here?

641
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Have you got her confession?

642
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,040
If you find it difficult to do this job,

643
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,640
no need to say any more.

644
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,920
I dare not.

645
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Back then,

646
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,040
you ever saved my life in Fujian.

647
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,360
I am not an ingrate.

648
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,080
But...

649
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Have you met difficulty
in handling this case?

650
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,080
Though I have witnesses
and material evidence,

651
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,720
Luo Shiyi asserted categorically that

652
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,720
she's been framed

653
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,920
and refused to admit to her crime.

654
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,880
In your opinion,

655
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,600
can a woman like her

656
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,680
be capable of

657
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,280
a major event like smuggling?

658
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,240
Just as your theory about
this case suggests,

659
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
if the smuggling thing is real,

660
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,920
it is absolutely impossible for her
to be the wirepuller.

661
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,120
It is very likely that

662
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Marquis Yongping is the mastermind
behind the scenes.

663
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,000
I used to think
that he devoted himself to the state,

664
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,000
so he was kind of respectable to me.

665
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,840
If he has breached the laws of
the imperial court

666
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,240
for personal gains,

667
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,440
I will do all in my power
to eliminate him.

668
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,560
His Majesty relies heavily on Xu Lingyi.

669
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
If you can't drag a confession

670
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,040
out of his wife Luo Shiyi this time

671
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,920
and can't convict him,

672
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,400
nobody can ensure that
in the days to come,

673
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,680
His Majesty will not
show leniency towards him.

674
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,240
Don't worry, Marquis Jingyuan.

675
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,320
Whether for personal reasons
or for the sake of the state,

676
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,120
I will go to all lengths
to close this case.

677
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,760
Good!

678
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,560
I just want to see in you

679
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,800
this spirit of working selflessly
for public interests.

680
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,320
(Prisoner)

681
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,600
Bring another prisoner here.

682
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,560
Shiyi!

683
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,560
If you want to know anything,

684
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,240
just ask me.

685
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,840
Shiyi!

686
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,640
Master Jian has nothing to do with this.

687
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,520
Shiyi!

688
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,840
Teacher!

689
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,320
Teacher!

690
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:48,140
(Prisoner)

691
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,640
Smuggling is a grave crime.

692
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,280
If you confess honestly,

693
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,520
maybe I can give you a light sentence.

694
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,720
I will ask you the question again.

695
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Did Xu Lingyi direct Xianling Pavilion

696
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,680
to smuggle the embroideries?

697
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,080
I have told you that

698
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,720
we concluded the deal

699
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,080
with the businessmen engaged in
legitimate business.

700
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,880
About other matters,

701
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,600
I have no knowledge at all.

702
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,720
Then how can you explain

703
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,160
(Transaction Documents)
the transaction documents

704
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,880
we obtained from the pirates?

705
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,360
On these documents, there are clearly

706
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,840
the seals of Xianling Pavilion.

707
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,240
I handle this deal

708
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,560
all by myself.

709
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,600
Marquis Yongping

710
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,680
and his wife

711
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,040
have nothing to do with it at all.

712
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,400
It is apparent that you and Luo Shiyi

713
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,480
are business partners.

714
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,320
How could you say

715
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,720
the deal has nothing to do with them?

716
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,160
Moreover, as a woman,

717
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,920
how could you
make contact with the pirates?

718
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,880
Under such circumstances,

719
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,320
you still refuse to repent.

720
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,000
Official Li.

721
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,680
Look at her...

722
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,320
Drag her away.

723
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,920
I will interrogate her some other day.

724
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,960
Yes.

725
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,080
Teacher.

726
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,840
Teacher.

727
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,260
(Prisoner)

728
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,240
How could they torture you so cruelly?

729
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,680
It is my fault.

730
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,400
I have dragged you into this.

731
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
You should blame me.

732
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,800
Shiyi.

733
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,480
Don't say this.

734
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,960
I have been living my life

735
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,600
in a lonely and wretched way.

736
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,160
But you

737
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,600
brought me much happiness

738
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,200
and you also

739
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,240
made it possible for me

740
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,160
to realize

741
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,120
my unrealistic aspirations.

742
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,800
My heart is filled up with

743
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,760
gratitude to you.

744
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Teacher, stop speaking.

745
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,960
Have a rest.

746
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,560
Don't worry.

747
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,880
I have said that

748
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,920
I handled the deal

749
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,600
by myself.

750
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,280
You have...

751
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,680
Teacher.

752
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,920
You have nothing to do with it.

753
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
Why did you say that?

754
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,320
Haven't we agreed that

755
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,760
you would say you know nothing about it?

756
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,640
Silly girl.

757
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
In my heart,

758
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,000
you are not only my student,

759
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,880
but also my family.

760
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,720
How can I do nothing and see you

761
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,840
get stuck in the prison?

762
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,920
You must stay alive

763
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,520
and pass down

764
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
our craft of embroidery.

765
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,920
Only in this way,
can you help more people.

766
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,800
I will. I will.

767
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,640
Teacher.

768
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,000
Hold on.

769
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,240
Xianling Pavilion needs you

770
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,720
and I need you.

771
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,560
You must hang in there.

772
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,680
I am fine.

773
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,670
Teacher.

774
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,840
Teacher.

775
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,230
Have you heard of it?

776
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,670
Xianling Pavilion has been seized.

777
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,150
It belongs to the wife
of Marquis Yongping.

778
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,920
(Bucket Rice)
Who had the guts to do that?

779
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,400
It is said that Xianling Pavilion
colluded with pirates in smuggling.

780
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,120
(Grain)
Even the wife of Marquis Yongping

781
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,080
has been apprehended
by the Ministry of Justice.

782
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,190
Really?

783
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,230
Yes, really.

784
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,360
No wonder recently,

785
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,800
rumors have been circulating everywhere

786
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,710
saying that the wife of Marquis Yongping
got into trouble.

787
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Yes, indeed.

788
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,120
Let go of me!

789
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,880
Tell me

790
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,560
whether my husband

791
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,280
was killed by Ou Yanxing

792
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,720
and Xu Lingyi.

793
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Tell me!

794
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,680
Young Master, something bad happened.

795
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,840
Your sister-in-law

796
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
has had Lady Amber caught
and brought to our mansion.

797
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,040
Where is she?

798
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,760
In the firewood room.

799
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,560
You still won't come clean?

800
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,680
If you continue remaining silent,

801
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,760
your beautiful face

802
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,080
may be scratched.

803
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,120
Stop him!

804
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,600
I know you work for Lixing.

805
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,720
But I suggest you make clear

806
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,800
who will be the master of our Ou family

807
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
in the future.

808
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,720
From now on, if anybody dares to

809
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,120
cause Amber any trouble,

810
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,440
I will not let him off.

811
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,840
Mr. Ou.

812
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,880
What are you doing?

813
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,600
Stand up quickly.

814
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,760
Mr. Ou.

815
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,440
Now Her Ladyship
is locked up in the prison.

816
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,080
You know her personality.

817
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,800
She must have been framed.

818
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,000
I beg you to save her.

819
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,480
How can I not know that

820
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,120
Shiyi has been framed?

821
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,120
I especially inquired about
this matter just now.

822
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,760
Now the authority has got
both witnesses and material evidence.

823
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,920
To get Shiyi acquitted of the crime,

824
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,960
we must try hard

825
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,440
to figure out a way.

826
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,920
Her Ladyship has never
made enemies in normal days.

827
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,400
So I think it is very possible that

828
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,960
your father has framed her.

829
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,600
Mr. Ou.

830
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,040
I am afraid that now

831
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,440
you are the only person
who can save Her Ladyship.

832
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,840
Impossible.

833
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,720
Mr. Ou.

834
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,440
It can't be him.

835
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,040
I know this is hard for you.

836
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,240
But be it smuggling

837
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,480
or colluding with pirates,

838
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,160
they are felonies
that can result in death penalty.

839
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,400
We can't do nothing

840
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,320
and watch Her Ladyship get killed.

841
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,080
Don't worry.

842
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,000
If my father really
did such a bad thing,

843
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,560
I won't sit watching.

844
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,200
Grand Secretary,
please be aware of this.

845
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,200
Someone has meticulously
orchestrated this case

846
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,040
to frame Xianling Pavilion purposefully.

847
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,760
This person's aim

848
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,040
is to frame our Xu family

849
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,200
through Xianling Pavilion.

850
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,640
About this case,

851
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
both witnesses and material evidence
have been obtained.

852
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,000
The evidence is irrefutable.

853
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,520
Even if what you said is true

854
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,400
and your wife has been framed

855
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,880
and wronged,

856
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
without evidence,

857
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,040
how could you make His Majesty

858
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,960
and all officials believe that?

859
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,000
Lingyi.

860
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,520
You always stay loyal
to His Majesty and care about people.

861
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,920
And you are always
an upright and incorruptible official.

862
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,440
I believe that

863
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,160
you are not involved in this case.

864
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
You have good judgement.

865
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,160
This case was elaborately orchestrated.

866
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,080
So it is not easy

867
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
to find the loopholes of the opponent.

868
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,560
But all conspiracies have flaws.

869
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,520
As long as His Majesty
and Grand Secretary Chen

870
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,640
can grant me some time,

871
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,360
I will surely find evidence

872
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,240
to prove the innocence of
Xianling Pavilion and my wife.

873
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,240
In the coastal regions,

874
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,720
the criminal activities of
pirates are rampant.

875
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,480
It has been disturbing
His Majesty a lot.

876
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,040
So His Majesty thought of
offering enlistment to them.

877
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,920
His Majesty entrusted you

878
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,400
with this matter.

879
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,080
Though His Majesty didn't
make his thoughts explicit,

880
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,720
to get rid of the trouble
caused by the pirates,

881
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,040
His Majesty

882
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,200
is more and more inclined to

883
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,360
lift the sea ban.

884
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,280
As for lifting the sea ban,

885
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,920
it will be the best

886
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,360
to have His Majesty

887
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
and your support.

888
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,680
But to lift the sea ban

889
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,400
concerns the ancestral policy.

890
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,080
Thus, there must be someone

891
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,760
who overrides all objections

892
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,800
to push it forward.

893
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,360
You are the most suitable candidate.

894
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,800
But now,

895
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
once your wife is convicted,

896
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
you will be implicated.

897
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,720
If you get into trouble,

898
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,360
how can you promote the lifting
of the sea ban?

899
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,720
So I hope you can
bear the big picture in mind

900
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,160
and won't let His Majesty down.

901
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,480
What do you mean
by saying this, Grand Secretary?

902
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,320
This is the memorial for you
to state you will divorce your wife.

903
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,240
(Divorce Agreement Memorial)
You only need to

904
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,960
submit it

905
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,400
at the joint trial
of the three judicial offices

906
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,760
and to state publicly that

907
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,680
you have nothing to do
with the smuggling

908
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,400
and your wife is to blame for all.

909
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,240
So you decide to divorce her

910
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,320
and drive her out of your Xu family.

911
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,800
Then your problem will be solved easily.

912
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,160
If I really submit this memorial,

913
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,080
I am afraid I will become

914
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,640
a person guilty of perfidy.

915
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Lingyi.

916
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,920
I just don't want to see

917
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,440
your effort over all the past years
go down the drain.

918
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,480
Now

919
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,840
success is just around the corner.

920
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,200
You mustn't lose the greater
for the less.

921
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,840
This is also His Majesty's thought.

928
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,280
Warden Jiang has sent a message.

929
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,320
It says that Master Jian has been
put to severe torture

930
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,440
and got badly injured.

931
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,080
This is obviously
extorting confessions by torture.

932
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,440
How about Shiyi?

933
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,760
How is she?

934
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,800
Official Li didn't torture Her Ladyship.

935
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,400
Entrusted by you, My Lord.

936
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,640
Warden Jiang also helped
Her Ladyship in secret.

937
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,920
So Her Ladyship is fine and safe
for the time being.

938
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,320
Go ask for Warden Jiang's help

939
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,080
to deliver some medication
to Master Jian.

940
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,440
Yes, My Lord.

941
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,280
My Lord, there is another thing.

942

Our people in Fujian
have sent back a message.

943
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,880
Did they find him?

944
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,040
When they got to the place,

945
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,560
Qin Zhiyuan was found dead.

946
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,560
It suggests that Marquis Jingyuan
has prepared for this in advance.
