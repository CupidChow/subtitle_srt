No way.

I wanted you to see this.

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,120
So, it's you

28
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,680
who used your cousin's power

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,520
to control most of the military
affairs in Fujian.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,200
You colluded with the pirates

31
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,560
in smuggling goods.

32
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,320
You also framed Xianling Pavilion

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,560
for smuggling goods.

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,920
That's right.

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,480
Why?

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,680
Only by joining hands with my cousin

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,920
can I control the military
affairs in Fujian

38
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,440
and reap massive profits

39
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,800
from maritime smuggling.

40
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,720
This is the only way

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,160
for us

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
to consolidate our power

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,200
and stay invincible

44
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,640
at the court.

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
This is why

46
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,600
you strongly objected

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
the lift of the sea ban.

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,480
The sea ban

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,320
concerns the Ou family's

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,960
survival.

51
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,320
I mustn't let Xu Lingyi succeed.

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,800
He wants to destroy the Ou family.

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,800
Therefore I must eliminate him.

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,080
Has it occurred to you

55
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,950
this is a felony punishable
by family extermination?

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,760
You're leading the Ou family

57
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,510
to its doom.

58
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,520
If you think so,

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,240
feel free to take this
confidential letter

60

will die miserably.

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,560

the Xu family is doing well.

155
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
My father, the Qiao family

and other officials

157
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440

158

What's done is done.

161
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,600
Tell me the truth

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,400
if you still see me as a friend.

163
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,160
If I must die,

164
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,560
then I hope to know why.

165
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm on friendly terms

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,040
with the Minister of Judicial Review.

167
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
The Minister of Judicial Review
is honest and upright.

168
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,600
He told me

169
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,680
the evidence for this case is valid.

170
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,880
If there's nothing to
prove you innocent,

171
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,160
the verdict will be reached

172
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,000
at the next joint trial held
by the three judicial offices.

173
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,840
The Minister of Justice will
be the presiding judge.

174
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
He believes Marquis Yongping

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
is related to this case.

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,200
If Xianling Pavilion
and I get convicted,

177
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,760
what will happen?

178
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,840
Although Master Jian

179
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
is the head of Xianling Pavilion,

180
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
all the evidence points at you.

181
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,160
If you are convicted,

182
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
you'll likely be sentenced to death

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,760
as the main culprit

184
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
and you'll definitely
implicate the Xu family.

185
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,160
Even though Marquis Yongping
has rendered outstanding services,

186
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,280
the scholars will condemn him.

187
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,440
Shiyi,

188
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
I feel guilty about you.

189
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,040
Mr. Ou,

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
can you do me a favor?

191
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,120
Sure.

192
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,400
Shiyi,

193
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,320
you're a trustworthy friend to me.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll do my best

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,200
to help you.

196
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,740
(Censorate)

197
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,000
Grand Secretary Chen.

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,840
What should we do?

199
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,720
Is Her Ladyship really going to do this?

200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,120
Madam Xu insisted.

201
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,400
Now

202
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,800
we have both the witnesses
and material evidence.

203
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,480
Admit to your crime.

204
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,840
Please judge wisely.

205
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,960
Xianling Pavilion and I

206
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,640
have never participated
in smuggling anything.

207
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
There's concrete evidence.

208
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,000
You are not to argue
against us speciously.

209
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,960
I have a question for you.

210
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,760
How did you contact the pirates?

211
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,480
Who ordered you?

212
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,560
You won't talk?

213
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,640
Then someone else will talk.

214
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Bring the witness.

215
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,620
(Supplement education
with laws and regulations)

216
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,920
Who is that?

217
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,720
I...

218
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,200
I am an embroidery girl
at Xianling Pavilion.

219
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,520
My surname is Zhang.

220
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,480
Embroidery girl Zhang,

221
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,520
tell us what you saw

222
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,280
honestly.

223
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,080
When I was working at Xianling Pavilion,

224
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,840
I often saw Marquis Yongping

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,040
appear in Xianling Pavilion.

226
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,280
He got involved in many deals

227
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,880
of Xianling Pavilion.

228
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,360
Marquis Yongping was behind

229
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,880
the embroidery smuggling thing.

230
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
Zhang,

231
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,000
how can you lie?

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,920
Did they force you to lie?

233
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Luo Shiyi,

234
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
restrain yourself

235
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
or I'll torture you.

236
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
Grand Secretary.

237
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,600
You both heard her.

238
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,280
I suggest

239
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,880
we scour Marquis Yongping's mansion

240
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,480
to find the truth.

241
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
Official Li,

242
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,480
isn't it too rash

243
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
to make such a decision

244
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,880
based on one person's statement?

245
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,520
Since Marquis Yongping
is related to this case,

246
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,840
we might as well

247
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,760
let him explain himself first.

248
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,720
Grand Secretary Chen is right.

249
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Marquis Yongping, go ahead.

250
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
(You only need to)

251
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,560
(submit it)

252
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,960
(at the joint trial
by three judicial offices)

253
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,400
(and to state publicly that)

254
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,480
(you have nothing to do
with the smuggling)

255
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,080
(and your wife is to blame for all.)

256
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,920
(So you decide to divorce her)

257
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,080
(and drive her out of your Xu family.)

258
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,600
(Then your problem
will be solved easily.)

259
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,520
Since my wife

260
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,280
joined Xianling Pavilion,

261
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,760
she's been promoting the craft

262
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,160
and helping the people.

263
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,840
She's never broken the law.

264
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,840
Many things about this case
are suspicious.

265
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,760
Officials,

266
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
look at the embroidery girl's wounds.

267
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,400
Maybe she agreed to confess

268
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
under torture.

269
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,480
Agreed to confess under torture?

270
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,320
Are you teaching me

271
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
how to interrogate a prisoner?

272
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,120
I have the right to torture

273
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,960
any prisoner who refuses to confess.

274
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
I'm obliged

275
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
to make the truth known to the public.

276
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,440
Official Li,

277
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,760
if the Xu family colluded with
the pirates in smuggling goods,

278
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,080
why would I advocate the policy

279
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,840
on lifting the sea ban?

280
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
Once the sea ban is lifted

281
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
and free trade is allowed,

282
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,120
smuggling will no longer be profitable.

283
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,480
Well...

284
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,920
I think some ill-intentioned people

285
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
are trying to bring the Xu family down.

286
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,360
Official Li,

287
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,520
reaching a verdict easily

288
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,800
means letting the ill-intentioned people

289
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,000
deceive and use you.

290
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,480
I may be dull,

291
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,760
but I can tell right from wrong.

292
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,920
Your defense

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,240
makes sense,

294
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
but it can't

295
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,280
disprove the existing
witnesses and material evidence.

296
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,080
Marquis Yongping,

297
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,080
there is ironclad evidence to prove

298
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,140
Madam Xu's participation in
the smuggling thing.

299
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,080
You don't have to make
any more arguments.

300
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
However, the evidence

301
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,320
can't prove someone is behind

302
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,800
Luo Shiyi to do all these.

303
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,320
All this happened too fast.

304
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,480
I haven't found

305
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,440
strong evidence.

306
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Please judge wisely.

307
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,120
I'll write a letter to His Majesty

308
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,920
and request an extension of time.

309
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,680
The case is supported
by ironclad evidence.

310
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,720
Delaying us won't help you.

311
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,560
I have important evidence for this case.

312
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,000
Officials.

313
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,640
I have important evidence for this case.

314
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,000
Who is that?

315
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,080
Drive him away.

316
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,880
Wait.

317
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
Let's take a look

318
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,520
at his evidence.

319
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,040
Bring it here.

320
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,140
(Supplement education
with laws and regulations)

321
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,460
(Divorce Agreement)

322
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,160
Officials.

323
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,800
That is

324
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,520
the Divorce Agreement
of me and Marquis Yongping.

325
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,830
Shiyi!

326
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,070
Don't you speak nonsense
in the court of law!

327
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,960
You and Marquis Yongping
aren't divorced.

328
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
You just want

329
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,240
Marquis Yongping exonerated.

330
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,480
Luo Shiyi,

331
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,840
what do you

332
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
mean?

333
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,440
Official.

334
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,320
the Divorce Agreement
proves we've divorced.

335
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,520
In other words,

336
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
I am not

337
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,200
Marquis Yongping's wife anymore.

338
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,600
It bears the signature and fingerprint

339
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,400
of Marquis Yongping.

340
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,680
If you don't believe me,

341
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,120
take a closer look.

(Xu Lingyi, Luo Shiyi)
(Divorce Agreement)

343
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
The other documents

344
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,480
are Xianling Pavilion's account books.

345
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,360
Every source of income

346
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,360
and every deal

347
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
has been recorded clearly.

348
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,480
Xianling Pavilion is
my personal property.

349
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,040
Since we've divorced,

350
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
Xianling Pavilion

351
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,160
has nothing to do with him.

352
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,440
Officials,

353
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,280
the Divorce Agreement
is a misunderstanding.

354
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,440
It doesn't count.

355
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,920
Of course it counts.

356
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,280
It bears his signature and fingerprint.

357
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
It is no child's play.

358
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,040
Shiyi!

359
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,760
I recognize
Marquis Yongping's signature.

360
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,440
The Divorce Agreement

361
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,040
does bear his signature.

362
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,600
The other signature
matches that of Luo Shiyi's

363
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,720
on the account books.

364
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
The Divorce Agreement

365
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,000
is effective.

(Prisoner)

367
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,680
Shiyi,

368
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,160
we're husband and wife.

369
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
I can weather the storm with you.

370
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
Why don't you trust me?

371
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,600
We're no longer husband and wife.

372
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,680
Please don't

373
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,040
say that again.

374
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,540
(Censorate)

375
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,500
(Supplement education

376
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,720
Officials,

377
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
the account books have been checked.

378
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
Xianling Pavilion and the Xu family

379
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
have no financial dealings.

380
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,760
Are you sure

381
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,720
these things aren't fabricated?

382
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,800
Official,

383
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
the account books show clear information

384
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,240
and the Divorce Agreement bears

385
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,240
their signatures and fingerprints.

386
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,580
(Supplement education
with laws and regulations)

387
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,040
Then

388
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,920
it is proven

389
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,720
Marquis Yongping

390
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,160
is not related to Xianling Pavilion's
smuggling case.

391
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,640
I'll report this matter

392
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,240
to His Majesty.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,960
This high-ranking official

394
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,640
mustn't be slandered.

395
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,160
He is right.

396
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,520
Luo Shiyi is the main culprit

397
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,320
in Xianling Pavilion's smuggling case.

398
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,800
She participated in smuggling

399
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,200
and committed serious crimes.

400
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,320
She should be executed three days later.

401
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,320
We'll report the situation
to His Majesty

402
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,280
and ask him to give a verdict.

403
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,560
Why?

404
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,880
Why did you do this?

405
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,200
I didn't want them to use me

406
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,120
to threaten you.

407
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,520
You know

408
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,960
I've never feared the attempts

409
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,000
to frame and attack me.

410
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I know.

411
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,200
But I was worried

412
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
more embroidery girls
at Xianling Pavilion

413
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,440
would testify against you

414
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,680
if the trial dragged on.

415
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,640

I'll sacrifice you?

she stood up

512
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,040
and risked her life

513
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,920
to protect the Xu family.

514
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,200
I had such a good

515
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,440
daughter-in-law,

516
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,160
but I didn't cherish her.

517
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,360
If she...

518
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,200
If she loses her life

519
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,920
for the Xu family,

520
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I'll be too ashamed

521
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,320
to face our ancestors.

522
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,720
Mother.

523
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,880
Lingyi,

524
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,440
we

525
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,680
still have three days.

526
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Hurry up and come up with a plan.

527
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,800
Come up with a plan as soon as possible

528
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
and save Shiyi.

529
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,520
I'll ask to see His Majesty.

530
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
I'll go with you.

531
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,520
In any case,

532
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,400
I'm a noblewoman of
the Second Standard Rank.

533
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,400
Mother.

534
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,360
Shiyi risked her life

535
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,400
for the Xu family.

536
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,440
I'll beg His Majesty to show mercy.

537
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,320
It's worth doing

538
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,840
even if it means my death.

539
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,760
Grand Secretary.

540
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,600
Marquis Yongping.

541
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,320
Why are you doing this?

542
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,560
His Majesty just started to believe

543
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,200
you didn't participate in smuggling.

544
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,960
You'll arouse His Majesty's suspicion

545
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,880
by making a scene here.

546
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
Leave now.

547
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,760
Don't make it worse.

548
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,680
Grand Secretary,

549
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
Shiyi sacrificed herself

550
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,160
to protect me.

551
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,640
I can't abandon her.

552
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
I'm sure you can see

553
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,920
this is targeted at me

554
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,800
and the proposal to lift the sea ban.

555
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,920
Do you really think

556
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,320
this will end

557
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,200
if I give up Shiyi?

558
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,200
We must find the mastermind

559
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,320
to prevent future trouble.

560
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,120
Nevertheless,

561
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
you can't act in haste.

562
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
If you infuriate His Majesty,

563
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,720
your wife,

564
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,920
you

565
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,600
and the whole Xu family won't be spared.

566
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,360
Please help me

567
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,600
ask His Majesty to show mercy

568
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,800
and postpone Shiyi's execution.

569
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,360
I'll do everything I can

570
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,520
to ascertain the truth.

571
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,120
Please help us

572
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,600
ask His Majesty to show mercy.

573
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
Alright.

574
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,600
I'll try my best.

575
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,440
-Mother, Mother.
-Mother.

576
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,440
I'm fine.

577
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,000
I can hold on.

578
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,520
Please show mercy, Your Majesty.

579
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,600
Please

580
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,720
show mercy, Your Majesty.

581
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,680
His Majesty gave an oral instruction.

582
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,160
As requested by Marquis Yongping,

583
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,920
Luo Shiyi's execution will be postponed

584
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,080
by a month.

585
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,440
If Marquis Yongping

586
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,680
doesn't find evidence

587
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,080
in a month,

588
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,400
the Ministry of Justice will
proceed to execute Luo Shiyi

589
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,640
and Marquis Yongping will be punished
for deceiving the emperor.

590
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,120
Respect this instruction.

591
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,440
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Majesty.

592
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,680
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Majesty.

593
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,680
My Lord.

594
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,240
My Lord.

595
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,240
I've completed my mission.

596
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,560
I kept Wang Jiubao safe.

597
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,040
Here.

598
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,920
Thank you for working hard these days.

599
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,840
Zhaoying mentioned

600
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,000
Her Ladyship got in trouble
in the letters.

601
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,000
What happened?

602
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,320
I'll explain that

603
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,320
to you later.

604
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,440
Tell me

605
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,640
where Wang Jiubao is.

606
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,840
I've contacted Wang Jiubao

607
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,040
and we agreed to meet
at a specific place.

608
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,240
Come with me, My Lord.

609
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,240
Stop!

610
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,360
Stop!

611
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,320
Stop!

612
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,000
Chief.

613
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,840
Chief.

614
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,920
That's Wang Jiubao.

615
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,720
Save him!

616
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,710
How did it go?

617
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,600
Take him away.

618
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll stop them.

619
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,670
I can't leave you behind!

620
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,230
Don't worry about us.

621
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,600
Go now or never.

622
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,880
I can't walk any longer.

623
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
Did you send

624
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,480
those men in black?

625
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
And now you

626
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,200
saved me hypocritically.

627
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,520
Marquis Jingyuan

628
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,680
sent those men after you.

629
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,520
My guards followed you all the way

630
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,560
to protect you.

631
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,880
Then who

632
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,640
bought off my followers

633
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
and launched a sneak attack on me?

634
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,120
I think Marquis Jingyuan did that too.

635
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,560
Didn't you make Marquis Jingyuan

636
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,880
suspect me?

637
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,200
You used his power to push me.

638
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
You wanted me to surrender
myself to you,

639
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,520
so as to improve your career.

640
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,800
You misunderstood me.

641
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,640
Misunderstood?

642
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,880
You officials

643
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,520
are the same.

644
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
Marquis Jingyuan

645
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,480
is our common enemy.

646
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,920
He even framed my wife

647
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,560
for engaging in smuggling.

648
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,400
My wife will be executed soon.

649
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
I promised His Majesty

650
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,800
to find evidence

651
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,840
in a short time.

652
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,920
If I can't do that, I'll be convicted
of deceiving His Majesty.

653
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,560
You know

654
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,800
I want to save my wife.

655
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,200
But more importantly,

656
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,920
I want to save the people
living along the coast.

657
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,600
You sent my wife and son back.

658
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,960
I haven't thanked you yet.

659
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,240
Here.

660
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,360
A great many

661
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
of my followers died

662
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,680
for this thing.

663
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,760
Now I'm giving it to you.

664
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,880
The evidence isn't with Wang Jiubao.

665
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,320
Xu Lingyi must have taken it.

666
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,680
Pass my order.

667
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,040
Go all out to hunt Xu Lingyi down.

668
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,520
(Prison guard)
Madam Xu,

669
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,560
you can stop waiting.

670
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,520
I heard

671
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,440
the Grand Coordinator of Fujian

672
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,400
received a report from his commander.

673
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,680
According to the report,
Marquis Yongping

674
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
was caught meeting with the pirates

675
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
in Fujian.

676
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,280
The Grand Coordinator of Fujian
has reported this to His Majesty.

677
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,640
His Majesty is infuriated.

678
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,120
He ordered for
Marquis Yongping's capture

679
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,160
and...

680
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,640
and your execution in ten days.

681
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,080
Don't panic.

682
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,360
Steady your nerves.

683
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,240
Kuan'er,

684
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,320
-now you are...
-His Majesty gave an oral instruction.

685
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,080
Xu Lingyi, Marquis Yongping,
colluded with the pirates

686
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,200
and ran away from the law.

687
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,680
Before he is brought to justice,

688
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,760
the Mansion of Xu will be closed
and nobody must come in or out.

689
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,000
Registrar Wang,

690
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,840
this must be a misunderstanding.

691
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,560
Lingyi

692
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,040
would never collude with the pirates.

693
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,400
If you insist

694
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,320
on accusing the Xu family

695
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,000
of such a crime,

696
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,560
the later generations will know

697
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,800
you frame loyal and good people.

698
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
Can you stand

699
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,800
being infamous?

700
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,480
You can plead for redress

701
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,480
at the Censorate

702
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,520
after Xu Lingyi is brought to justice.

703
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,360
How come you can't catch Xu Lingyi

704
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,880
even with the weight of numbers?

705
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,360
Forgive me, My Lord.

706
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,400
All regional governments

707
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,120
have issued orders for
Xu Lingyi's capture.

708
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,640
This is a

709
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,200
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

710
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,120
We must kill Xu Lingyi

711
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,440
before they

712
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,200
catch him.

713
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm afraid Xu Lingyi may surrender
himself to the government.

714
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,680
He won't.

715
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,080
Luo Shiyi will be executed

716
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,800
in ten days.

717
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,240
If he surrenders himself
to the government,

718
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
his confidential letter

719
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,840
and account books

720
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,880
might fall into my hands.

721
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,360
There's only one way

722
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,240
for him to save Luo Shiyi,

723
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,040
which is to bring
the confidential letter

724
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,400
and account books to
His Majesty within ten days.

725
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,640
If he pulls that off, His Majesty

726
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,240
will pardon Luo Shiyi.

727
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,160
I told you

728
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,440
not to visit Luo Shiyi.

729
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
My sister will be executed soon.

730
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,960
Please do me a favor

731
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,160
and let me see her for the last time.

732
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,480
No, you must leave.

733
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,200
Go away.

734
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,720
Go.

735
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,720
Minister.

736
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,640
Minister.

737
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,760
This must be Young Madam Wang.

738
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,280
Justice should be tempered with mercy.

739
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,280
Let Young Madam Wang in.

740
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,120
Yes.

741
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,480
Thank you, Minister.

742
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,320
Thank you.

743
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,960
No problem, Young Madam Wang.

744
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,960
Go ahead.

745
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,700
(Prison)

746
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,120
Shiyi.

747
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,920
Erniang.

748
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,080
How did you get in?

749
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,480
I wasn't allowed entrance at first.

750
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,400
But

751
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,680
fortunately,

752
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,280
I encountered the minister.

753
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,560
The minister?

754
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,920
Erniang.

755
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,000
I didn't expect to see you

756
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,600
before my execution.

757
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,480
Shiyi,

758
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,400
have you heard

759
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,360
what happened to Marquis Yongping?

760
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,080
The truth behind the situation
of His Lordship

761
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
and Wang Jiubao is yet to be discovered.

762
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,280
They said

763
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,880
His Lordship was wanted.

764
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,840
It means

765
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,560
they haven't caught him.

766
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,080
Once he returns to the capital,

767
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,760
the truth will surface.

768
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,040
But...

769
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,080
But you

770
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,280
will be executed soon.

771
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,240
Fujian is far from here.

772
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,080
I don't know if Marquis Yongping

773
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,760
can return in time.

774
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,200
I'm just worried

775
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,200
danger will befall him on his way back.

776
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,400
You...

777
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,800
This is not a place to stay.

778
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,720
Go home.

779
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,120
Greet Zhenxing for me.

780
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,560
Tell him

781
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,960
I appreciate his care for me.

782
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,360
I'd love to be his sister

783
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,200
in my next life.

784
00:42:54,860 --> 00:43:06,780
(Prison)

785
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,600
Zhenxing.

786
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,400
Minister.

787
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,940
(Prison)

788
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,120
Did you hear

789
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,440
anything just now?

790
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,440
Just the normal greetings
of the sisters.

791
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,160
I didn't hear anything unusual.

792
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,000
Then Young Madam Wang...

793
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Minister,

794
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,360
Marquis Jingyuan doesn't want

795
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,520
new problems to crop up.

796
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,500
(Residence of Luo)

797
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,960
I think Shiyi

798
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,440
was trying to tell me something.

799
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,160
But

800
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,680
I don't understand what she meant.

801
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,920
Was Shiyi worried

802
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,680
that people might hear her?

803
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,720
So she talked vaguely

804
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,120
and gave us a riddle.

805
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,320
Marquis Yongping went to the southeast

806
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,360
and met with Wang Jiubao
to prove Shiyi innocent.

807
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,760
Shiyi said

808
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,520
the truth behind their meeting
was yet to be discovered.

809
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,960
Does it mean

810
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,760
the evidence

811
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,000
that can prove Shiyi innocent

812
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,200
is held by Wang Jiubao?

813
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,560
The evidence

814
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,520
must be unfavorable
for Marquis Jingyuan.

815
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,200
That's why

816
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,000
Shiyi said

817
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,800
Xu Lingyi's trip back to the capital

818
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,520
was perilous.

819
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,440
Yes.

820
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,480
That must be what Shiyi meant.

821
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,960
But

822
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,280
what does the oil lamp mean?

823
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,800
Shiyi is worried

824
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,000
that Marquis Yongping's
return trip is perilous.

825
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,400
Does the oil lamp denote

826
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,480
something related to his perils?

827
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,400
Then what does the stone

828
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,120
mean?

829
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,280
I see.

830
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,920
Every place illuminated by the oil lamp

831
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,160
is bright.

832
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,240
Only the place under the light

833
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,680
is dark.

834
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,440
In other words,

835
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,840
dangerous places can be safe

836
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,000
and tricky to detect.

837
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,840
That makes sense.

838
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,320
What is

839
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,360
the most dangerous place

840
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,880
for Marquis Yongping?
