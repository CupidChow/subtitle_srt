what's wrong with your hand?

Father is so timorous.

As an adult,

Come here.

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,000
Your father is not timorous.

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,160
Your father and your mother

are trying to bear you
a younger brother.

So,

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
you'd better give them
some private space

in normal days.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,080

I will be a good boy.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,040
I won't go disturb them.

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,160
Right.

Duke Wei, Ren Kun

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,680

Recently,

it seems that he has been
getting closer to Xu Lingyi.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,560
As for Duke Wei,

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,720
I have a stratagem

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
that can solve this pressing problem
for you.

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,120
Duke Wei has an adopted daughter.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Her name is Liansong.

62
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,240
She is a great beauty.

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,040
Hu Jin is her biological daughter.

64
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
After Hu Jin died,

65
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
she was sent to the

Royal Academy

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
and can't buy back her freedom.

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,640
But Duke Wei

69
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,280
resorted to all means

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,880
to transfer her to Tianxiang House
to work as an entertainer.

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,520
In ordinary days, Duke Wei
keeps her under close watch.

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,800
How could that help?

73
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,400
Don't you remember that

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Xu Lingyi has

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
a daredevil brother-in-law.

from your shop

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
a few days ago.

86
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
It broke shortly after I bought it.

87
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
I want you to replace it with a new one.

88
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,000
Madam.

89
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,240
This bracelet seems to be
broken due to a fall.

90
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,360
It is obvious that you sold
the substandard bracelet.

91
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
Now you are trying to deny it.

92

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,360

and try to extort money from us,

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,040
we will report this to the government.

Why need I extort money from you?

He is a duke that has
come down in the world.

We didn't mean to

cause you trouble, Young Madam Wang.

114
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320
It's not a big deal, Young Madam Ou.

115
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,720
I may have broken it myself.

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
It has nothing to do with your store.

117
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
I won't exchange it.

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,200
If you say so,

119
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,040
I will feel sorrier about this.

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,440
How about this?

121
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,360
You may pick out

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
another bracelet that you like

123
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,320
to pair up with this one.

124
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,080
I will give it to you as compensation.

125
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,320
-Come on.
-Well...

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,600
How can I deserve
such generosity from you?

127
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
You need not think too much about this.

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,440
Go find out whether
there is anything you like.

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,600
Young Madam Wang,
you really have good taste.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,320
This exquisitely-polished
green jade bracelet

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
really goes with

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
your fair skin,

133
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,680
Young Madam Wang.

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,280
Well...

135
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,720
It is too valuable.

136
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,960
Um, how could I accept it?

137
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
A treasured sword
matches a hero the most.

138
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,760
By the same logic,
fine jade matches a beauty the best.

139
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
When I met you last time,

140
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,040
I felt that

141
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,160
we are like old friends.

142
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
Luckily, we met again.

143
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
Young Madam Wang,

144
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,560
if you agree,

145
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
let's be sisters

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
from now on.

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
How do you think of my proposal?

148
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,080
Young Madam Ou, it is such an honor.

149
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,840
How could I say no?

150
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,800
Come on, sister.

151
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,800
Take it.

152
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,920
Then I won't disturb you longer today.

153
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
Some other day,

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
I will surely go visit you
to express my thanks.

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,760
Look at you. Look at you.

156
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,000
We are already sisters.

157
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
Why are you still so courteous to me?

158
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,160
When there is a chance,
let's drink tea together.

159
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,800
Well, don't bother to
see me out.

160
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
Then I won't escort you out.

161
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,640
Young Madam, how about this?

162
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,120
Just discard it.

163
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,960
Yes.

(Demeanor of the Moon and Sunglow)

165
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,080
I only sell my art
and don't sell my body.

166
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,600
Sir, please behave yourself.

167
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,560
You want more money, right?

168
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
I have plenty.

169
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,120
You humiliated me so much.

170
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Please allow me to excuse myself.

171
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,760
Where are you going?

172
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,760
Let go of me.

173
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,720
If I don't let you go,
what will you do?

174
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,240
Wang.

175
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,640
You scared Lady Liansong.

176
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't be impatient. Take it easy.

177
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,960
Lady Liansong is not easy to get.

178
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,880
For a single dance,

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,240
she is paid 100 tael of gold.

180
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,080
If you want to make her yours,

181
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,560
you will have to pay a high price.

182
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,240
It is worthwhile to pay
1,000 tael of gold for her,

183
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,520
let alone 100 tael of gold.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,720
Young Madam.

185
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,600
Young Madam Ou

186
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,880
is so generous.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,560
I think

188
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,320
she wants to make friends
with you sincerely.

189
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
She has a good taste.

190
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,160
I take a shine to the moon.

191
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,440
Young Master is back.

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,480
It is a pity that the moon
sheds its light on the ditch.

193
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,280
It is of superior-quality.

194
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,240
I will take it happily.

195
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,160
Give it back to me.

196
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,720
My bracelet.

197
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,120
As the saying goes,

198
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,600
if a wife doesn't behave well,
it will be the husband's fault.

199
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,320
I will apologize to you now.

200
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,360
Please don't.

201
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,560
Please don't.

202
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,680
-Please don't.
-Young Master.

203
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,120
I beg you

204
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,400
not to beat Young Madam again.

205
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
If you give Baizhi to me,

206
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,000
I won't beat you.

207
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,480
Baizhi.

208
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
Baizhi has got ill

209
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,480
and gone to the farm house
for recuperation.

210
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Do you think that I don't know

211
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,680
you married her to someone

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,280
when I was gone?

213
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,360
Young Madam.

214
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,320
Young Master, please stop.

215
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,920
Back off.

216
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,560
I enjoy your crying.

217
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,280
Young Master, please stop beating her.

218
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,000
Keep crying.

219
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Young Master.

220
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,520
I beg you.

221
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,560
These tea leaves were given to me

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
by Lianfang.

223
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,960
They are quite good.

224
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,080
The tea made with them
tastes refreshing and mellow.

225
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,080
It suits my taste very much.

226
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,600
Today I have a cup poured
for each of you.

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,560
Have a sip, all of you.

228
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,680
In my storeroom,

229
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,480
there is soft-mist gauze.

230
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,240
It is the precious stuff
bestowed on me by His Majesty.

231
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,680
Each of you

232
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,320
can take one roll of it.

233
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,280
Weather being like this,
it would be the perfect material

234
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,760
to make bed curtains.

235
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,080
I have long heard that

236
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,280
you have all the good stuff,
Great Madam.

237
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,080
Today,

238
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,160
we are so lucky to have a share of them.

239
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,520
What is wrong, Shiyi?

240
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,080
Your Ladyship,

241
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,720
could you be pregnant?

242
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,920
Shiyi.

243
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,640
This is good news.

244
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,520
Hurry.

245
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,280
Hurry to send for a physician.

246
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
Yes, Great Madam.

247
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,360
Is she pregnant?

248
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,400
It is still early for me

249
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,920
to make sure of that.

250
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,600
It doesn't matter.

251
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,880
After her pulse conditions stabilize,

252
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,600
you can check on her again.

253
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,000
Physician,

254
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,720
what does Her Ladyship need to

255
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,040
be careful of?

256
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
Her Ladyship needs to rest well

257
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,280
and can't tire herself too much.

258
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,280
Thank you, Physician.

259
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,440
Let me see you out.

260
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
No, you need not, Great Madam.

261
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,200
Amber.

262
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
Hurry to help Shiyi

263
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,720
back to her room for rest.

264
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,640
Yes, Great Madam.

265
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,880
We have to leave, too.

266
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,880
Just excuse yourselves.

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,520
We will let you
have some rest, Great Madam.

268
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,480
Just go.

269
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,200
Your Ladyship,

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
are you all right?

271
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,560
Your Ladyship,
I am sorry to see you suffer.

272
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,640
I am not suffering.

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
I just feel nauseous

274
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,000
and want to eat sour stuff.

275
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,640
You want to eat sour stuff?

276
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,520
Well,

277
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,760
I am sure you are pregnant,
Your Ladyship.

278
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,560
When I was pregnant
with my son Yu in the past,

279
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,120
I felt the same.

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,720
Dongqing,

281
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,320
hurry to ask the kitchen staff

282
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
to cook more sour food for Her Ladyship.

283
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes, Madam. I am on it.

284
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,640
I have been tired

285
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,960
and drowsy these days.

286
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
Your Ladyship,

287
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,160
hurry to go back to rest.

288
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,600
It is said that

289
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
His Lordship has been spending the night

290
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,920
in the Western Lateral Court
in recent days.

291
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,120
Though Her Ladyship is a newcomer,

292
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
she is really something.

293
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,960
She got pregnant
in such a short time.

294
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,960
It can be seen that

295
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
she has won the heart of His Lordship.

296
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,160
Oh, it occurred to me just now that

297
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,960
it has been quite a long time

298
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,640
since I saw my son last time.

299
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,360
I will go check upon him today.

300
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,320
Lianfang,

301
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,200
the flowers in my nursery are blooming.

302
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,960
Will you like to go pick some?

303
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
Thank you.

304
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
But I'd rather not.

305
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,400
Your Ladyship,

306
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,640
I still think it is improper for you

307
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,480
to pretend you are pregnant.

308
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,000
Please think twice about it.

309
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,800
I know it is improper
for me to do so.

310
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,800
But after thinking it
over and over again,

311
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I still suspect

312
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,840
Concubine Qiao

313
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
has tampered with

314
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,080
the medication of Yuanniang.

315
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,240
So I need evidence to prove that.

316
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,920
Since Concubine Qiao

317
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
couldn't allow
late Her Ladyship's kid to stay alive,

318
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,560
she definitely can't allow

319
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,880
your kid to stay alive, either.

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,480
If she knows you are pregnant,

321
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,320
she may play her old dirty trick again.

322
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,480
If so, you can set up the trap secretly

323
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
to wait for her to fall into it.

324
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
But, how can we ensure
our lie won't be exposed?

325
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,600
If Great Madam knows the truth,

326
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,880
she will blame you again.

327
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,520
What's more,

328
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,080
we can't have His Lordship taken in.

329
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,000
Right.

330
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,200
Your Ladyship,

331
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,040
you will have your monthly period

332
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
in 15 days.

333
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,830
In the event that
you are exposed as a liar...

334
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,160
We will prepare my menstrual pads

335
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,590
for this month by ourselves.

336
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,160
Thus, we won't leave any record.

337
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,800
Yes, Your Ladyship.

338
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,960
When the truth
about this matter comes out,

339
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,720
I will apologize to everyone.

340
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,720
This matter concerns

341
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,110
the truth of Yuanniang's death.

342
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,310
I think the Great Madam and His Lordship

343
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,240
will understand my doing.

344
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,720
You never know
how things would turn out.

345
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
I used to think that

346
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,960
Lianfang and Lingyi
can have mutual love for each other.

347
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,720
I didn't expect that

348
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,640
Lianfang hasn't won
Lingyi's heart.

349
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,440
Surprisingly,

350
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,440
Shiyi who I have been
underestimating all along

351
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,480
got pregnant.

352
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,280
Mother.

353
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,520
This is a blessing for Shiyi

354
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,640
and a blessing for you
and our Xu family.

355
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
This is fate.

356
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
But I am worrying that

357
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,840
Lianfang

358
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,720
will take this badly

359
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,840
and will get herself hurt.

360
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,160
It is really unexpected that

361
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,200
Shiyi got pregnant so soon.

362
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,120
Exactly.

363
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280
My Lord.

364
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,680
Yizhen.

365
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Congratulations.

366
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,720
Congratulations to you, My Lord.

367
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,600
What for?

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,600
My Lord,

369
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
Shiyi seems to be pregnant.

370
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,720
Before long,

371
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,240
she will bear you a kid.

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
My Lord, your timing is perfect.

373
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,840
I just have the dishes
laid on the table.

374
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,600
Excuse yourselves, all of you.

375
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,280
Yes, My Lord.

376
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,880
I heard that you felt nauseous
and unwell

377
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,320
in the morning.

378
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,800
Yes, that's true.

379
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,440
But Mother and the others
might have misread it.

380
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,560
How about the physician?

381
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,080
What did the physician say?

382
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,920
He said that

383
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
he was not sure whether
I am pregnant or not.

384
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,480
Then why didn't you clarify that

385
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,840
you were just under the weather.

386
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,880
At that time,

387
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,040
they all thought I am pregnant

388
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,600
and the physician was not sure about it.

389
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
If I had denied it hastily,

390
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,000
they would have thought it is odd.

391
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,720
That's right.

392
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,000
These days,

393
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,040
I have been sleeping
in your place all along.

394
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:22,880
But nobody knows that

395
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,480
we have been sleeping in separate beds.

396
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,840
If you had denied it on the spot,

397
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,280
they would have found
the whole thing strange.

398
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,400
However,

399
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,800
it will be a breach of filial piety

400
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,880
to let Mother down.

401
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,040
I got an idea.

402
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,880
If you really want a kid,

403
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
I can help you.

404
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,560
Since you feel embarrassed

405
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,320
to admit you were lying,

406
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,240
I will help you

407
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,640
keep Mother from knowing the truth.

408
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,680
But you have to figure out

409
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,040
how to back up your lie by yourself.

410
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I need not back up my lie.

411
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,680
When I have a period next time,

412
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,680
the truth will come out.

413
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,120
If you really can't back up your lie,

414
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,640
as your husband,

415
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,840
I can make your lie come true.

416
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,600
My Lord, the dishes are cooling down.

417
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,120
Hurry to eat them.

418
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,320
My Lord.

419
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
(I lied to him, no matter what.)

420
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,040
(I will explain this to him)

421
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,440
(after I find the evidence)

422
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,560
(proving Concubine Qiao has caused
the death of Yuanniang.)

423
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:10,380
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

424
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,960
In the coming days,

425
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
prepare some millet and chicken congee

426
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,560
and some easily-digested dishes
for Shiyi

427
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,880
to nourish her stomach and spleen.

428
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes, My Lord.

429
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,920
In addition,

430
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,680
take good care of Shiyi.

431
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,880
If she needs anything

432
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,720
and you feel it hard

433
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
to let the Great Madam know,

434
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,000
you can come to me at any anytime.

435
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,320
Yes, My Lord.

436
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,440
We will try our best

437
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,160
not to betray your trust,

438
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,280
and to take good care of Her Ladyship.

439
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,680
It is really unexpected that

440
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,920
the imposing Marquis Yongping

441
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,840
turned out to

442
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,320
have such a considerate
and thoughtful side.

443
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,080
He is so nice to Her Ladyship.

444
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,140
(Residence of Luo)

445
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Your Ladyship.

446
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,840
You look much better today

447
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,440
than a few days ago.

448
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,320
I guess you will fully recover
from illness soon.

449
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,400
This proves that

450
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,800
the physician who treated me last time

451
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
is very capable.

452
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,760
Come on.

453
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,640
Congratulations to you, Your Ladyship.

454
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,720
News has just come from

455
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,000
the Xu family.

456
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,840
What news?

457
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,200
Why are you so excited?

458
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,600
Shiyi is pregnant.

459
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,440
Your Ladyship.

460
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,440
Your Ladyship.

461
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,840
Why couldn't I keep my mouth shut?

462
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,240
I just hurried to report
the good news to you,

463
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,960
but I forgot that

464
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,200
if Shiyi really bears
Marquis Yongping a child,

465
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,120
in the days to come,

466
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
things won't be easy for Zhun.

467
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,680
Madam.

468
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,640
Your Ladyship.

469
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,960
-Your Ladyship.
-Your Ladyship.

470
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,720
I will go summon the physician for you.

471
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
Your Ladyship.

472
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Your Ladyship.

473
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,720
Don't be so worried.

474
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,360
Your health is the most important thing.

475
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,440
How could I not worry?

476
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,960
Zhun is still a child.

477
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,040
In the coming days,

478
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,720
how will his life be like?

479
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,920
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

480
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,120
Your Ladyship.

481
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,560
Take a seat.

482
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,440
How are you feeling now, Your Ladyship?

483
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,200
I am fine.

484
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,480
Your Ladyship,

485
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,520
Great Madam

486
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
cares a lot about you.

487
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,400
If you

488
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,360
didn't persist,

489
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,760
she would exempt you from

490
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
the morning and evening visits to her.

491
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,560
She is so considerate of you.

492
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,400
I am envious seeing this.

493
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,400
Your Ladyship,

494
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
this is the first time that
you have got pregnant.

495
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,640
You must be careful.

496
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
Wen has experience of childbirth.

497
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,640
She must pass on her experience

498
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,000
to you.

499
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,920
It's been a long time.

500
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,120
I don't think Her Ladyship
would like to hear it.

501
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,040
Nevertheless,

502
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,360
I did hear that

503
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
one should be the most careful

504
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,680
during the first few months
of pregnancy.

505
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,200
I also heard that

506
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,480
the medication of the He's Clinic

507
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
is very helpful for a pregnant woman.

508
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,760
Someday,

509
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,160
I will go to the clinic

510
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,640
to get some medication.

511
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,840
Right. Right. Right.

512
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,040
I recalled it now.

513
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,280
The late Her Ladyship

514
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,040
gave birth to Zhun smoothly

515
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,280
after taking the medication

516
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
prescribed by the He's Clinic.

517
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,200
Greetings to you, Madam.

518
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,360
The matron of Xu family is pregnant.

519
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,240
She will come and get some
medication in recent days.

520
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,000
Shall I do the same thing
as I did last time?

521
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,640
Auntie,

522
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,760
taste the osmanthus cake

523
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,880
I made for you.

524
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,280
OK.

525
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,800
Mother,

526
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,320
the physician said I am pregnant.

527
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,000
That's wonderful.

528
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,440
Yuanniang,

529
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,520
you will bear Zhun a sibling.

530
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,600
Great work.

531
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,320
It's nothing.

532
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,000
As long as His Lordship is happy,

533
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,720
I will feel happy, too.

534
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,320
Congratulations to you.

535
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
I never intended to

536
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,440
cause you to die.

537
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I just didn't want to see

538
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,640
you bear His Lordship another kid.

539
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,400
I didn't want to see

540
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,520
His Lordship

541
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,560
treat you so nicely.

542
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,560
You died due to your bad health.

543
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,680
I am not to blame for that.

544
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,040
Madam.

545
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,720
Luo Shiyi.

546
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,880
You can't blame me.

547
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,520
It's your fault.

548
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,800
To win the love of His Lordship,

549
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,600
I must kick you out

550
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,320
as soon as possible.

551
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,200
It is just as you expected,
Your Ladyship.

552
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,960
Concubine Qiao

553
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,200
has colluded with

554
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,320
Mingjing of the He's Clinic.

555
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,760
I am afraid that

556
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,000
they have worked out a plan to harm you.

557
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,520
It is a pity that I stood too far away

558
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,160
and didn't hear them too clearly.

559
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,640
I am sure

560
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,360
they want to tamper with the medication.

561
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,440
If we can obtain

562
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,680
the medication from the He's Clinic

563
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
and have Mingjing caught,

564
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,440
we will have both human testimony
and material evidence.

565
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
Then she
won't be able to deny her crime.

566
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,520
You continue keeping an eye
on Concubine Qiao.

567
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,480
If there is anything noticeable,

568
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,680
you shall report it to me immediately.

569
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,760
I will also ask Wan Daxian

570
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,120
to watch Mingjing secretly.

571
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,880
Yes.

572
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,520
Your Ladyship.

573
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,520
Concubine Qin's maid Feicui is here.

574
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,000
Allow her in.

575
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,000
Your Ladyship,

576
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
the flowers in the nursery
of Concubine Qin

577
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,040
are blooming.

578
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,800
She hopes Your Ladyship
can send someone to look at them.

579
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
If there are some flowers you like,

580
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,440
they will be brought to you.

581
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
They will brighten your place.

582
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,120
Take my thanks to her.

583
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
Well, I will send Dongqing

584
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,280
to go have a look in a while.

585
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,320
Yes, Your Ladyship.

586
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
(Tender Breezes Passing on Warmth)

587
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,840
Madam, Dongqing is here.

588
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,080
Greetings to you, Madam.

589
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,480
Dongqing, you are here.

590
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,480
Pick anyone you like.

591
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,080
Those flowers over there
are fully blooming.

592
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,360
Madam, I thank you

593
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,720
on behalf of Her Ladyship.

594
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,880
Then I will take these two basins.

595
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,240
OK. Come here.

596
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,120
I have picked two basins, Madam.

597
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,040
Please excuse me.

598
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,640
OK.

599
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,080
Greetings to you, Shiliu.

600
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,560
Nice to see you.

601
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Nice to see you, too.

602
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,760
See if there is
any flower you like.

603
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,880
Just pick anything you like.

604
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,400
Here are so many flowers.

605
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,080
Flowers in this basin are in full bloom.

606
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,240
All of them are too common.

607
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
It is understandable that

608
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,720
none of the flowers in my place
can interest you.

609
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,120
Feicui.

610
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,480
Where are the two basins
of evening primrose here?

611
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,680
Dongqing took them.

612
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,800
Oh, no.

613
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
The scent of the evening primrose
is too strong.

614
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,640
It is not suitable to place them
in a pregnant woman's room.

615
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,840
Hurry to get them back.

616
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,000
OK. I will go right now.

617
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,760
Why did she pick those two basins?

618
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,600
Madam.

619
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,120
Madam. What are you thinking about?

620
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,880
Dongqing took the evening primrose

621
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,720
which is bad for the pregnant woman

622
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,480
from Concubine Qin's place.

623
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,200
Dongqing

624
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,800
is always careless.

625
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,120
It is not strange that
she has picked the wrong flowers.

626
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,840
You go visit the He's Clinic tomorrow.

627
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,760
Madam.

628
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,760
As you expected, I was tailed.

629
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,720
It's Luo Shiyi's maid.

630
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,720
Madam.

631
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,240
Such a malicious plot.

632
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,320
So she is already suspecting that

633
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,600
I was involved in Luo Yuanniang's death.

634
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,720
She held the memorial service
for her biological mother,

635
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,960
and claimed she is pregnant

636
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,760
and needs some medication
to secure the baby.

637
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,080
She is trying to lead me into the trap.

638
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,800
Madam.

639
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,200
Why do we do now?

640
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,600
There is no way for me to
fall into her trap.

641
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Maybe

642
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
this is a heaven-sent chance.

643
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,560
Madam.

644
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,320
What's your plan?

645
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,520
My actions used to

646
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,040
be conspicuous while hers were converted.

647
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,120
So I have been

648
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
led by the nose by her.

649
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,120
But now the situation is reversed.

650
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,960
Her actions are conspicuous
while mine are covert.

651
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,230
In this way,

652
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,840
she is giving me the chance

653
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
to have something on her.

654
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,120
I have just met Great Madam.

655
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,880
She is very happy

656
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,600
about Shiyi's pregnancy.

657
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,360
Are you sure that

658
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,880
she is pretending to be pregnant?

659
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,840
I have sent men

660
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,840
to watch
the Western Lateral Court secretly.

661
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,440
Though they have been on guard,

662
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,840
they couldn't make falsehood true.

663
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,760
I have found

664
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,640
some hints anyway.

665
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,160
She didn't eat much of the sour food

666
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,120
cooked by the kitchen.

667
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,160
If a woman is not pregnant,

668
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
it is impossible for her

669
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,040
to eat so much sour food.

670
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
Her monthly period is coming.

671
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,760
She can't suppress
the truth for too long.

672
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
I guess she is planning to expose
the evildoing of the He's Clinic

673
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,120
before her fake pregnancy is revealed.

674
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,360
Mother.

675
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,200
Qiao family must
give me a hand this time.

676
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,480
Otherwise, I will end up miserably.

677
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,720
You are my daughter.

678
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,200
How could I not help you?

679
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,960
If the cause of Yuanniang's death

680
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,720
is revealed,

681
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,120
you will be deprived of your status

682
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,120
in the Xu family,

683
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,440
and the amicable ties between
Xu family and Qiao family

684
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,000
that have lasted for generations

685
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,960
will be spoiled.

686
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,920
Since you asked me to come,

687
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,560
you must have worked out a plan.

688
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
We only need to

689
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,160
make people think

690
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,400
Luo Shiyi is untrustworthy.

691
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,720
In this way,

692
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,520
nobody in the Xu family

693
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
will believe her anymore.

694
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,760
Then while she is at a disadvantage,

695
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,760
we will expose her fake pregnancy.

696
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,560
Such being done,

697
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,440
both the Great Madam

698
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,120
and His Lordship will abandon her.

699
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,760
Such a wonderful plan.

700
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,320
Mother,

701
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,120
now Xiuyuan and I

702
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,960
are under the watch of her people.

703
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,520
So it is not convenient for us
to take actions.

704
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,880
I hope you can send people

705
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
to make investigations

706
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,280
to find out

707
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,600
what she has been doing

708
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,120
outside recently.

709
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,000
Just entrust me with this.

710
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
Moreover,

711
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,120
Mingjing of the He's Clinic

712
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,440
has been exposed.

713
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,280
Mother, could you please...

714
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,280
I will pay him more money

715
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,240
to send him out of the capital
as soon as possible.

716
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,120
If Shiyi reveals
the truth of this case,

717
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,920
he will lose his life.

718
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,760
I guess he knows what to do.

719
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,400
Then I can put my mind at rest.

Official Ou, the eldest son

are having close contact with each other

for unknown reasons.

755
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,720
So Official Ou invited us

00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,880
to perform the opera

I found that recently,

784
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,840
Ou Lixing

785
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
and Wang Yu from the Duke Mao's Mansion

786
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,240
are in close association.

787
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,760
This matter

788
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,280
seems fishy.

789
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,200
Is it?

790
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,400
Tell me your thoughts.

791
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,560
As you see,

792
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,200
Wang Yu and you

793
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,560
are brothers-in-law.

794
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,880
Normally, the Ou family

795
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,800
should be hostile to the Wang family.

796
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,320
But now Wang Yu
is befriending Ou Lixing.

797
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,920
There must be something nasty going on.

798
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,040
The Ou family is doing this

799
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,520
with evil intentions.

800
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,840
So I tell this to you

801
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,160
to alert you.

802
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,240
How did you come to know this?

But they actually

808
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,640
told me about this matter.

809
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,640
Lingyi, I am your biological brother.

810

Right.

820

821
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,640
Got it.

822
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,760
OK. I got it.

823
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,200
Look. That color is quite good.

824
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,520
Yes, it's good.

825
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,400

826
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,120
Young lady,

827
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,080
what can I do for you?

828

Are you the owner of this place?

829
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,200
Yes, I am.

830
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,680
I came from a disaster-hit place.

831
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,040
I heard that

and earn a living in your place.

834
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,280
I have been suffering from hunger

835
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,600
for quite a few days.

836
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,240
Could you take me in?

837
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,640
Don't be anxious.

838
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,360
I can't take in more people now.

839
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,520
But

840
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,880
there is another
embroidery workshop next door.

841

-Please help me.
-Young lady, don't...

843

I am going to die of hunger
in the street.

844
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,080
I am at my wits' end.

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,040
I implore you.

846
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,920

848
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,840
Rise to your feet.

849
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,520
Don't be anxious.

850
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,760
I agree to let you stay.

851
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,600
Here is the thing.

852
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,960
I will spare a post for you.

853
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,080
You go get a set of clothes
in the backyard

854
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,240
and get yourself
two steamed buns to eat.

855
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,360
Xiaopi,

856
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,960
lead this girl to the backyard.

857
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,600
Yes. Follow me, please.

858
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,080
-Go on.
-Thank you.

859
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,800
Thank you.

860
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,000
How much money can you make

861
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,240
after finishing the embroidery of
a piece of cloth of this size?

862
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,000
The price is fixed

863
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,480
by Master Jian.

864
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,840
Some pieces are cheap
and some are expensive.

865
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,000
Nonetheless,

866
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,720
we are not as skilled as Master Jian

867
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,280
and her disciples.

868
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,240
A piece of embroidered cloth
of this size

869
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,480
can only sell for 200 copper coins

870
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,840
and we will get 100 copper coins.

871
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Then how long does it take

872
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,560
to finish the embroidery
of such a piece?

873
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,720
At least, it takes five or six days.

874
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,120
At most, it takes 15 days.

875
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,480
Your labor is so cheap.

876
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,360
Xianling Pavilion is exploiting you.

877
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,400
Why did you say this?

878
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,320
In the other workshop,

879
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
such a piece of embroidery

880
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,720
can sell for two tael of silver.

881
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,360
Two tael of silver? Uh...

882
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,360
I am afraid that

883
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,720
in the name of teaching,

884
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,440
Xianling Pavilion

885
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,640
is exploiting your labor.

886
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,360
You can't put it this way.

887
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,880
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

888
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,760
Without Master Jian,

889
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,400
we couldn't have fed ourselves.

890
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,840
She is our benefactor.

891
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,000
But I heard that

892
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,640
the wife of Marquis Yongping

893
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,640
also has a share of the profits.

894
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,080
Profit sharing?

895
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,000
I am afraid that with her
as a powerful backer,

896
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,320
Xianling Pavilion will act willfully.

897
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,320
It is impossible.

898
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,560
Exactly.

899
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,320
It is impossible for

900
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,040
Master Jian and Master Luo

901
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,440
to do such evil deeds.

902
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,560
Right.

903
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,640
We can all see clearly that

904
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,560
Master Jian and Master Luo

905
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,840
treat us kindly.

906
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,200
Stop talking irresponsibly.
