You've embroidered for a long time.

The most part of the "One Hundred

take care of the rest.

You've been working hard.

You should go home and take some rest.

Okay.

29
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
Teacher, then I'll leave now.

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,760
I've listed the things

we need to take care of at home

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,240
for the next a few days.

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Show it

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,080
to the stewards tomorrow morning.

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,200
I put it on the table...

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
My Lord, you are back.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
Why didn't they tell me?

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
I stopped her from telling you.

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,920
Look at you.

41
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,800
You have to take care of
the household affairs

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,680
and prepare for
His Majesty's birthday gift.

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,240
It's too much for you to handle.

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,080
I'm fine.

45
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,320
I think you should

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,240
let the others

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
to take care of the household affairs
these days.

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,760
It's okay, My Lord.

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
There are too many details

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,520
with a lot of things involved.

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,240
If there's no a decision-maker,

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,040
no one is able to
take the responsibility.

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,560
My Lord, don't worry.

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
I can handle it.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,120
But I don't want you

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
to exhaust yourself.

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,080
It's not exhausting.

58
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Thank you for your care, My Lord.

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,640
I just hope

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,560
that this embroidery work

61
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,120
can be finished on time

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,830
and get chosen,

63
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,480
so that the embroidery skills

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
of our Xianling Pavilion

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,080
will be widely circulated.

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,400
And we'll be able to help

67
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,160
more females who like doing it.

68
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,960
In that case,

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,000
is there anything

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
I can help?

71
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
Your support

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
is the biggest help to me.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Alright.

74
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,040
You have my support.

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,360
(Longevity)
Mr. Ou, you also

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,160
contributed your effort to
this embroidery work.

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,400
Now that it's done,

78
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,200
of course we'd invite you over

79
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,320
to take a look at it.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Good is no longer enough to describe it.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,120
I'm sure Xianling Pavilion

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,640
will be chosen to assist with

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
His Majesty's birthday celebration.

84
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,160
But

85
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,640
you've got to keep

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
in mind the thing I said.

87
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,560
Don't worry, Mr. Ou.

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
I've had a counterplan.

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,280
I'll

90
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,280
bring this embroidery work

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,640
home for safekeeping.

92
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,840

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,080

It looks like you just
came back from outside.

98
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,640
Did you go to Xianling Pavilion?

99
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Yes.

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
Your Ladyship,
I heard that you were helping

101
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,560
Xianling Pavilion to prepare
His Majesty's birthday gift.

102
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,880
Is it the one that Dongqing is holding?

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Your Ladyship,

104
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm so curious.

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,720
Could you please open it

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
and let us take a look first?

finished packing

I have, Mother.

why are you sad?

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I don't want you to leave.

124
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,920
Mother, don't be sad.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
It's not like I'll never come back.

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,520
When I return,

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,560
it'll be the time
I get the scholarly honor.

It just hit me.

After you leave,

130
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,080
you won't be able

131
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
to see Zhun for a long time.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,040
Would you like to say goodbye

133
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
to Zhun and play with him

134
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,960
for a while before you leave?

135
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,600
Zhun likes playing
hide and seek the most.

136
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,720
Would you like to play it with him?

137
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
Mother is indeed thoughtful.

138
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
I'll go right now.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Go ahead.

140
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,320
Brother.

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
Brother. What are you doing here?

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,880
Zhun.

143
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
I'll go to Leshan.

144
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,120
I need to prepare for my trip,

145
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
and I can't study with you anymore.

146
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,760
So I came here to say goodbye to you.

147
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
This is a farewell gift for you.

148
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
Why are you going to Leshan?

149
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,360
To study there,

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,920
so that I can pass the imperial exams

151
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
and win glory for our family.

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Since Master Zhao

153
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
is not watching,

154
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
let's go play for a while.

155
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,680
Really? You can play with me?

156
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Of course.

157
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,240
I'll play anything you want with you.

158
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
I want to play hide and seek.

159
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Sure. Let's go.

160
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,240
I'll stand right here.

161
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,120
I won't watch.

162
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
I'll count to 100.

163
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,800
Go ahead and hide.

164
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
I'll start counting now.

165
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,360
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

166
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,880
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen...

168
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,640
Zhun, are you ready?

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,640
Brother. Brother. Brother.

170
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,160
Mother. Mother.

171
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,120
Bad news.

172
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,400
What's wrong, Yu?

173
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,080
I can't find Zhun.

174
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,320
What happened?

175
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,280
Slow down and tell me.

176
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
One hour ago,

177
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,440
I went to Fushou Court

178
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,680
to play hide and seek with Zhun.

179
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,160
But I have no idea where he hid.

180
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,880
I searched the entire garden

181
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,000
but I couldn't find him.

182
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,440
Amber,

183
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,440
tell the gatekeeper

184
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,480
to stop people from going out

185
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
until Zhun is found.

186
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,960
Yes.

187
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,800
Dongqing,

188
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,080
gather all the maids

189
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,800
and servants

190
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
to search for Zhun.

191
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
Yes, Your Ladyship.

192
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,960
Now, lead the way.

193
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,520
Zhun. Zhun. Zhun.

194
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
Zhun.

195
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,960
Zhun. Zhun.

196
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,400
Zhun.

197
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,400
Zhun.

198
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,520
Zhun.

199
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,280
Zhun.

200
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Zhun.

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,400
-Zhun.
-Zhun.

202
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,440
Zhun.

203
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,040
-Zhun.
-Zhun.

204
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,600
Zhun.

205
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,440
What's going on?

206
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,320
What happened to Zhun?

207
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,640
-Zhun is missing.
-Zhun.

208
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
It's all my fault.

209
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
I only cared for my own business

210
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,160
and I failed in watching over Zhun.

211
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,760
If anything happened to Zhun,

212
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,560
I...

213
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not mother's fault.

214
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,240
It's mine.

215
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,400
You both need not to worry.

216
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
Without my or Great Madam's permission,

217
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,560
no one can take Zhun out.

218
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
So, I'm sure he's still in the mansion.

219
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,920
Listen up.

220
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,840
Look carefully for

221
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,080
those small places where

222
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,520
a kid can hide.

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
Don't miss any corners.

224
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
-Yes.
-Yes.

225
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,560
Yu.

226
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,520
Do you still remember

227
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,120
where Zhun was heading?

228
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,480
That direction.

229
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,640
This is the toy I gave Zhun.

230
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,480
It should be this direction.

231
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,640
Quick and search for him.

232
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

233
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,320
It's okay.

234
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,840
Zhun must've

235
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,520
been attracted

236
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,400
by these toys.

237
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,360
It should be this direction.

238
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,320
Attracted?

239
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,800
My Lord.

240
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,160
The embroidery.

241
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,800
Let's go.

242
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
Dongqing.

243
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,640
Get up. Be careful.

244
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,360
You are hurt.

245
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,120
Go and apply some medicine.

246
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm fine. The embroidery.

247
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,240
Just go.

248
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
Why did you do it?

249
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,640
Shiyi made this

250
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
for His Majesty's birthday celebration.

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,960
Don't you know

252
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,120
that what you did
will hurt our Xu family,

253
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,560
even hurt Yu?

254
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,840
Why did you do this?

255
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,800
Zhun is found.

256
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,880
-He's found.
-Your Ladyship.

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,960
Zhun.

258
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,520
Zhun.

259
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,200
Are you okay?

260
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Someone locked me up.

261
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,280
I was so scared.

262
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,880
Who wanted to hurt you?

263
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,720
Tell us.

264
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't know.

265
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,600
It's okay. You are fine.

266
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,440
You are safe now.

267
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,800
Where did you find Zhun?

268
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
In an abandoned room

269
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,640
near the storage house.

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,040
Alright. Don't cry.

271
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,720
Your Ladyship.

272
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,280
When you

273
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,800
said that Zhun was missing,

274
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
I was at the storage house and I saw...

275
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,560
and I saw...

276
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,240
Yu was near that room.

277
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,320
Mother. Father.

278
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Please trust me.

279
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,360
I didn't hurt my brother.

280
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,880
Don't make excuses.

281
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,520
There's no such coincidence.

282
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,040
You played with Zhun right before

283
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,960
Concubine Wen burned the embroidery.

284
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,200
In my opinion,

285
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,080
you helped Concubine Wen

286
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,560
to hide Zhun

287
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,920
and lured Her Ladyship out,

288
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,360
so she could sneak in
and burn the embroidery.

289
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
You two,

290
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,440
one burned the embroidery
to hurt Her Ladyship,

291
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,040
and the other hurt Zhun.

292
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,800
What are you up to?

293
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,240
Late Her Ladyship...

294
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,200
Late Her Ladyship is watching you
from Heaven.

295
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,640
No. It's not true.

296
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
Father, please trust me.

297
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,440
I didn't hurt Zhun.

298
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,600
Father.

299
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,160
I really didn't hurt Zhun.

300
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,080
I did them all.

301
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,920
Yu has nothing to do with it.

302
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,120
Amber.

303
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Take the kids away first.

304
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,880
Yes.

305
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,070
Let go.

306
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,560
-Mother.
-Let go.

307
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,520
Mother.

308
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,350
Mother.

309
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,120
Be honest.

310
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,320
Did the Ou family

311
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
ask you to do it?

312
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,920
The Ou family?

313
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,240
So what if they did?

314
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,480
You should ask if your Xu family

315
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
has ever treated me nicely?

316
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,480
You married me

317
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,400
for the military provisions only.

318
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,960
It's because your Wen family

319
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,680
used the provisions as a threat

320
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,320
and forced His Lordship to marry you.

321
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
My Lord, even if you punish me,

322
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,960
I still have to say it.

323
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,440
Her Ladyship may not know

324
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,680
about your Wen family,

325
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,480
but I know you guys very well.

326
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,240
Over the years,

327
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,480
the Wen family have profited a lot

328
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
by using the name of the Xu family.

329
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,360
Don't you know that?

330
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,040
How dare you say that?

331
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,080
My Lord, since you married me,

332
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,720
if not for the sake

333
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,160
of the Wen family,

334
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,240
at least for the sake

335
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,560
of our marriage, you should

336
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,480
treat me nicely.

337
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,680
When Late Her Ladyship was alive,

338
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,680
you still came to visit me
once in a while.

339
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,400
But ever since this woman
married into the Xu family,

340
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,520
you've never

341
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,600
visited me again.

342
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,680
On the day of my birthday,

343
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,800
I was waiting and waiting.

344
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,200
Finally,

345
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,080
you came to my room.

346
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,240
But you just

347
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
had to take His Lordship
away from me on that day.

348
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,560
Forget it.

349
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,920
Just let it be.

350
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,600
But Yu

351
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,280
is everything to me.

352
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,400
He's my life.

353
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,080
He's my only son

354
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,480
in this world.

355
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,840
Yet you take him away from me.

356
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,320
You want to kick him out of this house.

357
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,040
How can I let you do that?

358
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,960
The others have nothing

359
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,920
to do with it.

360
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
Neither Shiyi nor Zhun

361
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
has anything to do with it.

362
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,200
I know you'd protect them.

363
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,720
Zhun is your son.

364
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,600
So is Yu.

365
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,640
For all these years,

366
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,760
you've never cared about us.

367
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,160
You only have them

368
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,640
in your heart.

369
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,760
Now,

370
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,000
take her to her room.

371
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,600
Yes.

372
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,720
No one is allowed in or out

373
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,960
without my permission.

374
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,640
Yes.

375
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
Nanny Tao.

376
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,560
Listen carefully.

377
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,600
This woman

378
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,120
will have her own child sooner or later.

379
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,200
At that time, I'll see

380
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,440
if late Her Ladyship you mentioned

381
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,080
can protect Zhun.

382
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,680
My Lord.

383
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
The Palace brought an edict for you.

384
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,360
They are waiting in the main hall

385
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
and asking you and
Her Ladyship to receive the edict.

386
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
It's someone from the Ou family.

387
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,640
It's an edict for the Xu family.

388
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,660
(Imperial Edict)

389
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,080
"Xu Luo Shiyi,

390
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,120
Marquis Yongping's wife,

391
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,760
is hereby required to
present the embroidery to the Palace.

392
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Respect this."

393
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,120
Madam Xu,

394
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,800
please receive the edict.

395
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,920
Madam Xu.

396
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,560
Congratulations, Marquis.

397
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,280
Eunuch,

398
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,400
it's not the deadline for
presenting the gift yet.

399
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
Why did His Majesty
issue the edict so early?

400
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,560
Marquis,

401
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
about that, actually

402
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,520
you should thank

403
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
Official Ou.

404
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,200
It's him who told His Majesty

405
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
that Xianling Pavilion

406
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,120
was opened by Madam Xu.

407
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,200
And

408
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,560
His Majesty heard

409
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,400
that Madam Xu prepared

410
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
an embroidery work for his birthday,

411
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
so he's very

412
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,280
interested in the gift.

413
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,480
That's why...

414
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,040
It's His Majesty's graciousness.

415
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,720
It's a good thing for the Xu family.

416
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,600
My Lord, you need not to worry.

417
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,360
Eunuch,

418
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360
Official Ou,

419
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,840
please give me a moment.

420
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
to get ready.

421
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,240
And then I'll go to the Palace with you.

422
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,040
Please, Madam Xu.

423
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,120
But don't take too long.

424
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,560
No one can

425
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,960
afford to be late.

426
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,200
That's right.

427
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,800
We'll wait right here for you.

428
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,120
Marquis, you also came.

429
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,400
Eunuch Huang.

430
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,720
Greetings, Eunuch Huang.

431
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,840
Madam Xu.

432
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,680
His Majesty asks me

433
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
to take a view of

434
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,960
Madam Xu's work on his behalf.

435
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,760
This is a picture of
the Four Divinities,

436
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,000
which are Vermilion Bird,
Black Tortoise,

437
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,480
Azure Dragon and White Tiger,

438
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,080
It is used for fending off the evil
and praying for good fortune.

439
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,100
(Longevity)

440
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,600
I've been in the Palace for decades,

441
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
(Longevity)
and I've seen countless good stuff,

442
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,440
but it's the first time I've seen

443
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
such an exquisite embroidery.

444
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm flattered, Eunuch Huang.

445
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,400
Your embroidery skills are
indeed excellent.

446
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,840
And the picture holds
auspicious meanings.

447
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,440
The idea and the techniques

448
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,640
are totally comparable with that

449
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,360
of the best embroidery girls
in the Palace.

450
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,600
Eunuch Huang,

451
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,720
we can't present this work
to His Majesty.

452
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,440
Official Ou,

453
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,920
did I miss anything?

454
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
What's wrong with this embroidery?

455
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,080
What Madam Xu registered was
"One Hundred Longevity Picture."

456
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,680
Yet the one she brought today

457
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,520
is the picture of the Four Divinities.

458
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,160
She secretly switched the presents.

459
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,720
Isn't that cheating His Majesty?

460
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,640
Marquis, Madam Xu,

461
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,960
is what Official Ou said true?

462
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
Eunuch Huang,

463
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
what Official Ou said is true.

464
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,840
Xianling Pavilion did register

465
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,280
"One Hundred Longevity Picture"
originally.

466
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,520
Madam Xu, so how will you explain this?

467
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,640
Eunuch Huang,

468
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,240
I definitely dare not

469
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,920
cheat His Majesty.

470
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,840
His Majesty's birthday celebration
is an important event.

471
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,240
Embroidery is easy to get dirty

472
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,560
or damaged.

473
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,160
In case of any accident,

474
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,120
I've asked

475
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,320
the Ministry of Rites

476
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,160
to add another item a few days ago,

477
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,560
which is the picture of
the Four Divinities.

478
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,560
I'm the one who's in charge

479
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,480
of the birthday celebration.

480
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,920
If there's a new item added,

481
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,600
how come I didn't know about it?

482
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,320
Servant,

483
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,240
bring me the list of the presents

484
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,200
for His Majesty's birthday.

485
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,280
Yes.

486
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,600
You mean

487
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,920
Ou Lixing will make trouble

488
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
when Xianling Pavilion
presents the gift?

489
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,640
Judging from

490
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,600
all the things he did before,

491
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,280
it's highly possible.

492
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,200
Xianling Pavilion means nothing

493
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,160
to the Ou family.

494
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,520
If they are going to make trouble,

495
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,360
their target must be our Xu family.

496
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,160
It is impolite not to reciprocate.

497
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,960
It's time for our Xu family

498
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,880
to make a move in the Ministry of Rites.

499
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,860
(Xianling Pavilion)

500
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,940
(Picture of the Four Divinities
One Hundred Longevity Picture)

501
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,140
(Ou Lixing)

502
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,200
Xianling Pavilion did register

503
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,600
the picture of the Four Divinities.

504
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
Madam Xu was telling the truth.

505
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,120
I'm sorry for questioning you.

506
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,400
No way.

507
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,560
What's going on?

508
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,640
How come I knew nothing about it?

509
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,880
Minister,

510
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,400
you reviewed

511
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,920
the list in person.

512
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,000
There's even your signature on it.

513
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,320
Official Ou,

514
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,800
these items

515
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,880
will be delivered tomorrow morning.

516
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,000
Do you think we need anything else?

517
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,040
Minister,

518
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,000
these documents

519
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,240
need your signature.

520
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,520
Minister,

521
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,080
we need you to make a decision on this.

(Gift List For
The Emperor's Birthday Celebration)

523
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,680
And here, Minister.

524
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,200
Minster, it's quite urgent.

(Xianling Pavilion Gift List
Signature: Ou Lixing)

526
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,280
Official Ou,

527
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,200
take a close look.

528
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,800
Is that your handwriting?

529
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,960
I got confused just now.

530
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,640
Eunuch Huang, please forgive me.

531
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,360
It is my

532
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,680
signature.

533
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,880
As long as there's no mistake.

534
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,000
I guess you forgot
since you've been busy

535
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,120
with the celebration preparation.

536
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,960
Although they registered two items,

537
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,840
His Majesty wants to view the
"One Hundred Longevity Picture."

538
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,240
Madam Xu,

539
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,640
when can you present

540
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,240
the "One Hundred Longevity Picture"
to His Majesty?

541
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,160
Madam Xu,

542
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,480
when can you bring that picture here?

543
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,800
Eunuch Huang,

544
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,080
actually the
"One Hundred Longevity Picture"

545
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
was already finished a few days ago.

546
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,840
But it was accidentally burned

547
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,440
right before we came to the Palace.

548
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,760
While I was terribly shocked,

549
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,320
the edict suddenly came,

550
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,760
asking us to present the gift
ahead of time.

551
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,040
Hadn't been prepared for the other item,

552
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
I'm afraid

553
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,400
I wouldn't have been able to get away

554
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
with the crime of cheating.

555
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,960
I will tell everything to His Majesty

556
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,800
and let His Majesty to make a decision.

557
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,600
Marquis, Madam Xu,

558
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,520
excuse me for a moment.

559
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,760
I'll go tell His Majesty right now.

560
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,080
Thank you, Eunuch Huang.

564
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,000
Mr. Ou.

565
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,240
How come you are here alone?

566
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,200
Where's Shiyi?

567
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,040
Your brother came to our mansion
with His Majesty's edict

568
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,920
right after Concubine Wen burned the

569
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
"One Hundred Longevity Picture,"

570
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,680
and asked Her Ladyship
to bring the picture

571
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
and enter the Palace immediately.

572

(Delicate Meticulousness)

573
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,120
Her Ladyship already left.

574
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,360
I just told everything

575
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
to His Majesty.

576
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,640
His Majesty is very satisfied

577
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,240
with the picture of the Four Divinities.

578
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,640
Here's a verbal edict from His Majesty.

579
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,200
Ou Lixing,
Minister of Ministry of Rites,

580
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,800
failed in fulfilling his duty
and used his position for private gains.

581
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
He shall be flogged for 20 times.

582
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,360
How come?

583
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,760
Servants.

584
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,160
Take Official Ou outside

585
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,320
and flog him in the front yard.

586
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,920
Eunuch Huang.

587
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,880
I'm loyal to His Majesty.

588
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
I've never used my position
for private gains.

589
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,280
I want to see His Majesty.

590
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,440
Eunuch Huang.

591
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,760
Let me see His Majesty.

592
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,760
Let me see His Majesty.

593
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,600
Marquis.

594
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
You've seen

595
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,200
what happened just now,

596
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,920
and you know
whose side His Majesty is on.

597
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,960
Do not let His Majesty down

598
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,400
since he trusts your
Xu family this much.

599
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,320
I'm thankful for His Majesty's trust.

600
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,040
And thank you, Eunuch Huang,
for backing us up.

601

Madam Xu.

602
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,560
His Majesty has chosen Xianling Pavilion

603
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,040
as the representative of
the folk embroidery workshops

604
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,000
to participate in
his birthday celebration,

605
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,360
Please go back and prepare for it.

606
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,960
I'm grateful for His Majesty.

607
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,120
And thank you, Eunuch Huang.

608
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,560
Let's go.

609
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,840
Official Ou,

610
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,600
you should go home and take a good rest.

611
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,840
Servants.

612
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,480
Yes.

613
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,120
Help Official Ou to go back.

614
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,720
Yes.

615
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,640
Eunuch Huang.

616
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,760
May I ask why

617
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
His Majesty punished

618
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,960
Official Ou

619
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,440
since he didn't

620
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,320
seem to make a big mistake?

621
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,120
Official Ou told His Majesty on purpose

622
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,120
that Madam Xu

623
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,040
was preparing the embroidery,

624
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,680
which aroused His Majesty's interest.

625
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,320
But somehow,

626
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,360
the just finished embroidery work

627
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,640
was burned all of a sudden.

628
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
His Majesty knows clearly

629
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,360
what happened in between.

630
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,680
The Ou family have made
a lot of trouble recently.

631
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
His Majesty is well aware of that.

632
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,600
So he took this chance

633
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,280
to give the Ou family a warning.

634
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,880
My Lord, thanks to your precautions,

635
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,630
we didn't fall into Ou family's trap.

636
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,670
But I didn't expect

637
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,000
that even Zhun and Yu

638
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,230
were used by them.

639
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,480
Marquis.

640
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,920
Madam Xu.

641
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Are you okay?

642
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,230
Mr. Ou, we are fine.

643
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,920
Thank you for your reminder,

644
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,230
so that we could be prepared.

645
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,120
Otherwise, we'd be in for a big trouble.

646
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,230
Let's go.

647
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,150
Lixing.

648
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,600
What happened to you?

649
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,480
What are you doing here?

650
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,800
To make fun of me?

651
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,480
Lixing,

652
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,000
let's go home first.

653
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,800
You haven't told me

654
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,800
why you'd show up there.

655
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,760
I see

656
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,800
that you are very close with
that Madam Xu.

657
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,480
Did you collude with
the Xu family to set me up?

658
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,920
You are the ill-intentioned one.

659
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,880
You asked for it.

660
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,840
Don't take it out on me.

661
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,360
What did you say?

662
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,840
Don't you have nothing to do
with burning

663
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,360
the embroidery work of
Xianling Pavilion?

664
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,160
You are a victim of your own evil deeds.

665
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,040
As your brother,

666
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,320
I have to remind you,

667
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,440
who is unjust is doomed to destruction.

668
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
You are just an illegitimate son.

669
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,360
Who gave you the right to educate me?

670
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,200
Don't think we don't know

671
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,240
that you invested

672
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,520
in Xianling Pavilion.

673
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,600
I've already become

674
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,840
one of the owners

675
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,880
of Xianling Pavilion

676
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,920
before Madam Xu joined.

677
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,120
She has nothing to do with it.

678
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Father.

679
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,680
I think he has long been colluding

680
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,840
with the Xu family.

681
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
According to our clan regulations,

682
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
he should be expelled from our family

683
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,280
and removed from the household.

684
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,400
Yanxing, come with me.

685
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,040
About what happened today,

686
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,240
it's all because Lixing was too stupid

687
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,320
and fell into the others' trap.

688
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,040
He deserved it.

689
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,960
I don't even care to ask.

690
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But as one of our Ou family,

691
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,120
you should help Lixing

692
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,040
and share the burden.

693
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,800
Take a look.

694
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,220
(Picture of a Female)

695
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,840
This is the girl

696
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,160
I chose for you.

697
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,360
She's the legitimate daughter

698
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,840
of Minister Fang
of the Ministry of Personnel.

699
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,680
She's gentle and kind,

700
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,080
a perfect match for you.

701
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,240
Father,

702
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,080
please let me make my own decision
about my marriage.

703
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
You don't need
to worry about it, Father.

704
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,320
What?

705
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,320
You don't want to marry her?

706
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,160
Because of that Madam Xu?

707
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,160
Father.

708
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,040
Madam Xu is my friend and I admire her.

709
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,160
She's the Marquis's wife.

710
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,800
She could have enjoyed a carefree life.

711
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,600
But for her interest

712
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,480
and aspiration,

713
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,280
she's still devoted to what she likes.

714
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,040
I admire her a lot.

715
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,000
You don't just admire her.

716
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,720
You've got to know

717
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,760
that she is

718
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,680
after all one of the Xu family.

719
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,080
And you should know clearly
what the relationship

720
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,000
between the Xu family
and our Ou family is.

721
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,840
Father.

722
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,120
There's something

723
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
I've always wanted to say to you.

724
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,920
And today I have to say it.

725
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,040
Alright. Go ahead.

726
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,320
Our conflict with the Xu family

727
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,000
is pointless

728
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,160
to the court

729
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,880
and harmful

730
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,360
to the people.

731
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,160
His Majesty has expressed his attitude

732
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,320
by flogging Lixing this time.

733
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,760
If we keep going against the Xu family

734
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
and anger His Majesty,

735
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
it will do nothing good
to our Ou family.

736
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,520
Why don't we just back off now?

737
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,200
It may offer us a chance to survive.

738
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,840
Father...

739
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,720
Shut up.

740
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,880
Lixing is right.

741
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,360
Because of my indulgence,

742
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,920
you've become out of control.

743
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,440
Servants.

744
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,000
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

745
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,720
Take Master Yanxing out

746
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,920
and punish him according to
our family rules.

747
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,840
Yes.

748
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,520
You have to know

749
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,440
that Xu family and Ou family
hold a deep grudge against each other.

750
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,280
On every aspect,

751
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,960
it's going to be an endless war
between the two families.

752
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,120
If we back off,

753
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,360
we'll lose everything and never

754
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,800
be able to come back again.

755
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,320
As one of the Ou family,

756
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,200
you must make a choice.

757
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,920
Nanny Tao.

758
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,680
Your Ladyship.

759
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,240
How's Zhun doing?

760
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,320
Zhun was startled,

761
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,720
but he's okay.

762
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,520
I'll come to check on him often.

763
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,080
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

764
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
Nanny Tao,

765
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,200
please take good care of Zhun.

766
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,360
My Lord, no worries.

767
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,240
I will take good care of him.

768
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,120
As long as I'm alive,

769
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,120
I won't let Zhun get hurt ever again.

770
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,080
Luckily Zhun is alright.

771
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,200
But it made Mother worried.

772
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,160
It's okay.

773
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,400
Let's explain it

774
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,160
to Mother tomorrow.

775
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,400
When you first told me

776
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,680
that Concubine Wen was an informant,

777
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,560
I couldn't believe it.

778
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
And now I see

779
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,440
how evil-minded Concubine Wen is.

780
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,200
I've sent her to the farm

781
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,920
and she'll never be allowed to return.

782
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,520
Shiyi.

783
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,840
You made the biggest

784
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
contribution this time.

785
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,480
We couldn't have made it

786
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,160
hadn't been for
His Lordship's meticulous plan.

787
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,360
You and Lingyi worked together

788
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,720
and prevented a big trouble
for our family.

789
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,200
No need to be modest

790
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,120
about your contribution.

791
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,240
Thank you for your compliment, Mother.

792
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,640
Shiyi,

793
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,440
from today on,

794
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,760
I hope you can leave Xianling Pavilion.

795
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,040
Mother,

796
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,400
I understand your concern.

797
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,320
I promise we'll

798
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,520
take care of this thing.

799
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,800
Although

800
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,880
Zhun is safe

801
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,440
and you didn't get into trouble

802
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,920
in the Palace this time,

803
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,560
what about next time?

804
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,040
Have you thought about that?

805
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,960
I will say no more.

806
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,680
You two should think about it.

807
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,520
Zhun, you are here.

808
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,640
Let me get you a piece of cake.

809
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,440
Here.

810
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,320
Good boy.

811
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
What are you doing?

812
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,320
You'll drown yourself just because
your hand is injured?

813
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,880
What... What are you doing?

814
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,600
If you are worried
that no one will marry you,

815
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,000
I'll marry you.

816
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,000
Who... Who would marry you?

817
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,480
And I wasn't going to kill myself.

818
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,920
So what were you doing?

819
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,160
I was going to pick up
this handkerchief.

820
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,640
Besides,

821
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,760
I don't care about

822
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,920
scars at all.

823
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,640
That's it?

824
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,480
I misunderstood you.

825
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,800
But I meant what I said.

826
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,840
You can think about it.

827
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,560
If you talk nonsense again,

828
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,840
I won't forgive you.
