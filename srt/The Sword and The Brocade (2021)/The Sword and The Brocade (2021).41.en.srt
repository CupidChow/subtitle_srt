00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,260
=Episode 41=

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,920
I heard that in order to
persuade Mother to change her mind,

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,600
you had been given
a good dressing down by her.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,440
Don't mind it, Lingyi.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,520
Being scolded by Mother

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,400
is nothing to me.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,880
I have got used to it.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,400
While Mother was
in the heat of the moment,

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,240
why must you contradict her?

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,520
There is something
you don't know.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,630
After what happened to Xiaolan,

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,240
I came to realize that

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,160
rules can restrict people,

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,880
but can't control people's feelings.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,240
And in a love relationship,

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
there can't be a third person.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Lingyi,

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,400
I can see that

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,240
Shiyi is special to you.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,280
To protect your conjugal bond with her,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,800
as far as I am concerned,

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,520
you should consider
the matter prudently.

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,520
I will never

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,160
take Dongqing as my concubine.

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,320
There is no room for discussion
regarding this matter.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,720
Mother is determined
to make this happen.

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,880
So she won't give up
till she attains her aim.

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,280
But she is doing this
for the sake of our Xu family.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,120
You can't disregard her feelings

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,720
completely.

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
If I were you,

49
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,400
I would not know what to do, either.

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,360
If Mother can see sense,
this matter will turn out well.

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,400
If she persists with her decision,

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,480
I won't give in.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,480
But you need not worry.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,520
I won't make it hard for Mother.

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
And I won't hurt
Shiyi's feelings, either.

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,360
I believe that

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,240
there will always be
a solution to this problem.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,640
Your Ladyship.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,720
You have been shirking your meals

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,400
over the past two days.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
For whatever reason,

62
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,720
you can't starve yourself
and impair your health.

63
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
I want to see Dongqing.

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,480
Your Ladyship,

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,840
I failed you.

66
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,560
I believe what you said.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
You need not apologize to me.

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,000
You have been treated unfairly.

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,520
Rise to your feet.

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,440
Your Ladyship,

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,200
I am afraid that I will let you down.

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,760
What do you mean by saying this?

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,320
There is one thing
I have been hiding deep in my heart.

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,320
I have no intention
to let it known by others.

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,270
But under the current circumstances,

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
I have to speak my mind.

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Since I came to
the Mansion of Xu with you,

78
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,600
I have been able to see
His Lordship day in and day out.

79
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,120
Unconsciously,

80
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,400
I took a fancy

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,800
to His Lordship.

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
I love His Lordship.

83
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,840
What did you say?

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,560
I said I have a crush on His Lordship.

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,280
But His Lordship

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,160
only has eyes for you.

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,960
He never

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,440
sees me.

89
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
So I took His Lordship's belt secretly

90
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
and kept it

91
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
as a reminder of the owner.

92
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,600
Your Ladyship,

93
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,440
please fulfill my wish

94
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
considering that

95
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,880
I have been serving you
for so many years.

96
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
If I become His Lordship's concubine,

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,440
I won't vie with you for anything.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,680
And I will obey you in everything.

99
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,640
Based on what you said,
you have a thing for His Lordship

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,040
and you want to be

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,240
his concubine.

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
I know it is improper for me
to have such thoughts,

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
but I just can't control my feelings.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Please fulfill my wish, Your Ladyship.

105
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,520
Your Ladyship,

106
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,880
you look pale.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,520
Is anything wrong with Dongqing?

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
Do you know what Dongqing said to me?

109
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,920
She asked me to grant her wish

110
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,280
and allow her to become
His Lordship's concubine.

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,280
Dongqing has worked as my maid
for so many years.

112
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,800
I used to think that
I know her very well.

113
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,840
But I still can't guess right

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,560
what she is thinking.

115
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,280
Your Ladyship.

116
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
Don't get excited.

117
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
Just sit down to have a rest.

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
You've been
so nice to Dongqing.

119
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,000
But now, even she...

120
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,320
What are you planning to do,
Your Ladyship?

121
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,840
Amber.

122
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Be seated.

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes.

124
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,320
I can do nothing.

125
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,200
I can't sit idly and watch

126
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,840
Dongqing get sold to others.

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,120
Besides,

128
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,920
it is a fact that she longs
to be His Lordship's concubine.

129
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,640
Once His Lordship accepts her,

130
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,680
we will harbor hard feelings

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
toward each other forever

132
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,720
for we love the same man.

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,280
In the coming days,

134
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,600
we will clash with each other

135
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,600
due to conflicts of interests.

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,840
I feel afraid even thinking of it.

137
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Your Ladyship.

138
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,160
I have never seen you look so upset.

139
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,520
I prefer what you used to be

140
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,560
when you were doing things
in Xianling Pavilion.

141
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,480
Back then,

142
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,200
you were free and unrestrained

143
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,760
as well as glowed with a radiant look.

144
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,280
But now,

145
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,400
you are making concessions
for the common good

146
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,120
and are out of spirits.

147
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,640
It is hard for me to imagine

148
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,760
you are living such a constrained life

149
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
in this mansion

150
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,800
after losing Xianling Pavilion.

151
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
Yes.

152
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,680
It is such an honor to be
the wife of Marquis Yongping.

153
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,920
But I think

154
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,600
the three years

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
I spent in Yuhang

156
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,360
have allowed me to enjoy more freedom.

157
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,320
Your Ladyship, do you really think

158
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,600
you were happier
living in Yuhang in the past

159
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,030
than living here now?

160
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,640
Even if I think so, what's the help?

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
I can't go back to the past.

162
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,720
Your Ladyship,

163
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,920
you can't give up

164
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,800
so easily.

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
You always strike me

166
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,200
as a courageous person

167
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
who is brave enough
to take control of your own fate.

168
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,240
You even dared to

169
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
do an earth-shaking deed

170
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,120
like escaping marriage.

171
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,880
However,
after you married into the Xu family,

172
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
you lost your courage gradually,

173
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,240
became afraid to move forward

174
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,920
and kept deviating from your past self.

175
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,280
Are you really willing to

176
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
be manipulated by others
throughout your life?

177
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,680
What?

178
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,640
Xu Lingyi is going to
take Dongqing as his concubine?

179
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,600
This is going to happen
in the next couple of days.

180
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,200
Shiyi has to accept Dongqing,

181
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,360
who is like a sister to her,
as her husband's concubine.

182
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,440
How can she survive
such an emotional blow?

183
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
What has she done on earth

184
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,760
to make the Xu family
force her like this?

185
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,200
How about Marquis Yongping?

186
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,680
Has he done nothing

187
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,880
and just watched Shiyi suffer
such unfair treatment?

188
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
His Lordship has said loads of things

189
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,240
to appease Her Ladyship.

190
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,280
But if he dares to

191
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,040
neglect his filial duty

192
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
and disobey the Great Madam,

193
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
he will be denounced
by the scholars

194
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
in both speech and writing.

195
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,080
In the end,

196
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,840
he still can't stop this from happening.

197
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,760
She must be very sad now.

198
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,880
But I can do nothing to help her.

199
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Since Her Ladyship
married into the Xu family,

200
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,720
she hasn't enjoyed any peaceful days.

201
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,280
I can't bear to

202
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
see her be treated so unfairly anymore.

203
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,000
I beg you to help Her Ladyship, Mr. Ou.

204
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,280
If I can help her,

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,080
I will definitely do my utmost.

206
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,840
But this is an internal affair
of the Xu family,

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,280
I can't interfere in it.

208
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
If it is an internal affair
of the Xu family,

209
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,680
it is natural that
you can do nothing about it.

210
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
But if Her Ladyship

211
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,800
leaves the Xu family...

212
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,640
She will leave the Xu family?

213
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,880
I will be honest with you.

214
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,840
I know Her Ladyship is in possession of

215
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,920
a Divorce Agreement

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
signed by His Lordship himself.

217
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,800
I have heard of the whole thing.

218
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,080
It was caused by me.

219
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,560
I didn't mean to

220
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
cause you such great trouble.

221
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
I am really sorry.

222
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,880
Mr. Ou, you need not blame yourself.

223
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,880
Even without you,

224
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,520
things will turn out this way.

225
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,000
Since I married into the Xu family,

226
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,960
I have been aware of

227
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,440
the things awaiting me ahead.

228
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,680
I once had the naive thought that

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,400
as long as I made efforts,

230
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,240
I would be able to make a difference

231
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,360
and would be able to

232
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,240
get the life I want.

233
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,080
However, unknowingly,

234
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
I sank into

235
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,040
the plight I am in now.

236
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,760
Well, what is your plan now?

237
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,520
Will you really give in
to Great Madam Xu

238
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,400
and resign yourself
to their arrangements?

239
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
Of course I won't.

240
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
But if I want to keep Dongqing,

241
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,320
this will be my only choice.

242
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,560
I know in your mind,

243
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,080
there is a different world.

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,160
If you compromise now,

245
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
you will be confined
to the household affairs

246
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,680
and all your talent will be wasted

247
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,760
with all your wishes going up in smoke.

248
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

249
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,800
If you don't make compromises willingly,

250
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
how can you swallow the bitterness?

251
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,160
Shiyi,

252
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,960
you always say that

253
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,320
a person's destiny

254
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,840
should be taken
into one's own hands, right?

255
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,200
If you want to leave the Mansion of Xu,

256
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,240
I will give you a hand.

257
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,080
Do you know what you are saying?

258
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,320
Don't worry.

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,480
I didn't say this
with any selfish motive.

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,520
I just want to try my best

261
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,240
to help you out of the plight.

262
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,320
Then, in the coming days,

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,520
you will be like
the fish swimming in the vast sea

264
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,920
and the bird flying high in the sky.

265
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,480
You will feel free

266
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,080
to live the life you want.

267
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,480
Right, Your Ladyship.

268
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Mr. Ou said the right thing.

269
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,080
If you continue staying
in the Mansion of Xu,

270
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,160
I am afraid that
you won't be able to enjoy any peace.

271
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,520
Your Ladyship!

272
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,960
Your Ladyship!

273
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,960
Your Ladyship!

274
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,120
It doesn't matter.

275
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,960
Sorry to let you see this.

276
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,320
Go fetch my outer gown

277
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,680
from the carriage.

278
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,800
Yes, Your Ladyship.

279
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
Please allow me
to think about it carefully.

280
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,880
Madam.

281
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,480
This is the camellia

282
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,040
just delivered today.

283
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,080
Put it there.

284
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Yes.

285
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Go back to your work.

286
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,900
(Luo Shiyi and Ou Yanxing
met as planed.)

287
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,320
The two of them met so soon.

288
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,160
It seems that
a great drama is going to unfold.

289
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,280
Where is Shiyi?

290
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,600
Report to you, My Lord.

291
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,600
Her Ladyship went out

292
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,600
with Amber.

293
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,320
I don't know where they've gone.

294
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,420
(Ou Yanxing: Please meet me
at Mingyang tea house.)

295
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,240
My Lord.

296
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,200
You went to see Ou Yanxing?

297
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,680
Yes.

298
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,040
You know clearly that our family

299
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,800
doesn't want to see you
associate with Ou Yanxing.

300
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,680
Why did you act arbitrarily

301
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
and meet him in secret?

302
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,720
He asked me to meet him suddenly.

303
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,440
I worried that
there might be something urgent.

304
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,520
Now our whole mansion is in a mess.

305
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,240
Could you please bear in mind that

306
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,720
you are Marquis Yongping's wife.

307
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,720
Marquis Yongping's wife!

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
So what?

309
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,320
You only want a woman

310
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,600
to bear you children

311
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,520
and manage your household affairs.

312
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,440
You only want a tool
who obeys you in everything.

313
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,240
I am fine to

314
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,440
give up the title!

315
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
How could you say such words?

316
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I am always forced by you to

317
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,800
make one choice after another.

318
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,680
None of you cares about my feelings.

319
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,640
Amber.

320
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Pack my things.

321
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
What are you going to do?

322
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
I am going to leave this place

323
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,040
and leave you.

324
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,240
You can't leave here

325
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,160
as you like!

326
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,320
My Lord, don't you remember that

327
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,200
you have given me

328
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,640
a Divorce Agreement.

329
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,280
Zhaoying.

330
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,480
My Lord.

331
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,350
Go find the Divorce Agreement.

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,160
Yes, My Lord.

333
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,520
My Lord,

334
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,840
I can't find it.

335
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
From today onward,

336
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,160
without my consent.

337
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,880
you mustn't leave your room.

338
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,720
Shiyi has been grounded
by His Lordship.

339
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,640
How come this happened?

340
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,800
Since she married into our Xu family,

341
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,680
she has been causing trouble constantly.

342
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,800
As the matron of our Xu family,

343
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,520
how could she act arbitrarily?

344
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,240
It is time to rein in her temper.

345
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,080
Darling.

346
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,280
How do you like my writing?

347
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,920
Master Lixing.

348
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,060
(All is ready except what is crucial.)

349
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,320
The fish has bitten.

350
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
We will be able to
bring in the net soon.

351
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,240
Ask our people

352
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,040
to keep watching the Xu family.

353
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes.

354
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,880
What we have planned

355
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
is going to be achieved soon.

356
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,960
Darling.

357
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,000
Why aren't you happy?

358
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,320
Yes, I am.

359
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,600
Of course I am happy that

360
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,200
your plan can work.

361
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,760
But as far as I am concerned,

362
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,640
to be the master of the family

363
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,440
is not the most important.

364
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,360
For me,

365
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,600
the most important thing is that

366
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,160
you can be

367
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,120
safe and sound.

368
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,000
Rest assured.

369
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,400
I will definitely stay by your side

370
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,800
world without end.

371
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,280
Our good life is on the way.

372
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,580
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

373
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,680
(Now Her Ladyship)

374
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,040
(can't even get out of her room.)

375
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,960
(How can she go meet Mr. Ou?)

376
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
(I must figure out a way.)

377
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,600
Madam.

378
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,280
What did you say?

379
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,600
His Lordship has written a
Divorce Agreement to Her Ladyship.

380
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,760
Yes, he did.

381
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,240
But he didn't allowHer Ladyship to leave.

382
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,400
As I see it, His Lordship

383
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
is giving Her Ladyship
a hard time intentionally.

384
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,440
Madam,

385
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,560
I guess you are very clear about

386
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,600
what happened to my sister.

387
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
And you know the best

388
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,200
what kind of person His Lordship is.

389
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,120
Her Ladyship won't be happy

390
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,560
staying in the Xu family.

391
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
Madam,

392
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
now you are the only person

393
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,160
who can help Her Ladyship.

394
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,960
Well...

395
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,000
What are you doing?

396
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,360
Don't let others see this.

397
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,720
What do you want me to do?

398
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
Could you please

399
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,000
help Her Ladyship
get out of the Mansion of Xu?

400
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
It is possible for Her Ladyship
to leave the Xu family.

401
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
But you must think it through.

402
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,760
Once she leaves,

403
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,160
she won't be able to return.

404
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,760
Madam,

405
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,120
Her Ladyship will never want to return.

406
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

407
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,340
(Divorce Agreement)

408
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Your Ladyship.

409
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,420
(Xu Lingyi)
(Luo)

410
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,900
(Xu Lingyi)
(Luo Shiyi)

411
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,160
Fire!

412
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,880
How come there is a fire?

413
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Why are you still standing here?

414
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,800
Hurry to put out the fire!

415
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,400
But His Lordship ordered us...

416
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,600
At such a time,

417
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,520
if you let the fire spread,

418
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,720
it might reach this courtyard

419
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,680
and hurt Her Ladyship.

420
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,440
By then, how can you
answer to His Lordship?

421
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,880
Well, we will come back soon.

422
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,200
Hurry up!

423
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
The time will come soon.

424
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,400
The time will come soon
for everything to come to a close.

425
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,960
Giddyup!

426
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,520
Marquis Yongping is here!

427
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,520
Shiyi!

428
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,200
Shiyi!

429
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,400
My Lord,

430
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,560
I have signed the Divorce Agreement.

431
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,520
From now on,
we will have no ties with each other.

432
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,280
Without my permission,

433
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
you can't leave.

434
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,120
Marquis,

435
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,400
Shiyi is no longer your wife.

436
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,760
Please don't do improper things.

437
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,520
You were lucky last time.

438
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,080
This time, I won't go easy on you.

439
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,680
You can't protect her.

440
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,000
If you wish her the best,

441
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,600
you shouldn't stop her from leaving.

442
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,320
Xu Lingyi, let go of him!

443
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
You are courting death!

444
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,000
Who are you people?

445
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
Ou Lixing,

446
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,920
I can see that
you have been plotting this for long.

447
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,080
I don't find it odd that
you want to kill me.

448
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,680
But it surprises me that

449
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,840
you also want to kill
your brother.

450
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,560
A man doing great things
doesn't care about small matters.

451
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,720
Ou Yanxing,

452
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,520
you have abandoned yourself to vice.

453
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,240
So you don't deserve to be
one member of our Ou family.

454
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,160
I will just take this chance to

455
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,120
rid our family of its black sheep.

456
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,320
Lixing,

457
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,880
though we don't see eye to eye,

458
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,080
we are still siblings.

459
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
How could you be so cold-blooded?

460
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,800
If you devote yourself
to doing business outside,

461
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,120
I won't give you any trouble.

462
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,760
But you returned to our family.

463
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,640
Then you have been
going against me in everything.

464
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,440
You just get yourself killed!

465
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,760
If you kill the officials
of the imperial court,

466
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,800
His Majesty will hold you accountable.

467
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,600
By then, can your Ou family afford
to face the consequences?

468
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,680
That's not true, Marquis Yongping.

469
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,280
My brother and your wife
love each other dearly.

470
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,480
They decided to elope.

471
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,680
You burst into anger learning of it.

472
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,600
You chased and intercepted them here.

473
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
Then you killed them cruelly.

474
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,200
Tomorrow,

475
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,600
across the capital,

476
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
the stories about my brother and you

477
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,480
who killed each other for a woman

478
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,400
will go around.

479
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,800
How pathetic and sad!

480
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,000
So you planned to kill the three of us

481
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
at the very beginning.

482
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,800
By doing this,

483
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,280
Shiyi won't find out

484
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,040
the cause of her mother's death;

485
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
I, the enemy of your Ou family

486
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,200
will be eliminated;

487
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
More importantly,

488
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,080
you can eliminate your brother.

489
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,600
Then he won't be able to

490
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
vie with you for the title
of the heir apparent.

491
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
This is killing three birds
with one stone.

492
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,320
Shiyi's mother

493
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,640
is really killed by you?

494
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,040
Why did you kill her?

495
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,720
You will join her

496
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,200
in the nether world soon.

497
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,760
If you want to know the reason,

498
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,080
you can ask her yourself.

499
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,080
My mother happened to

500
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,800
see you meet the pirates secretly.

501
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
So you killed her.

502
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,320
Right?

503
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,960
Even if you find out the truth,

504
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,120
what can you do to me?

505
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,160
It's her fault.

506
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,840
She shouldn't have seen

507
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,080
what she was not allowed to see.

508
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
Break into the jail?

509
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,840
Do you think
the jail of the Ministry of Justice

510
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,600
is similar to the prison
of the county government?

511
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,560
Even if I muster troops here,

512
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,640
it is impossible for us
to rescue the prisoners.

513
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,440
While Xu Lingyi were taking you back

514
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,680
to the capital,

515
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,720
I sacrificed my informant

516
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,880
that I planted in his barracks

517
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,800
many years ago

518
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,320
to rescue you from his hands.

519
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,400
I didn't expect that you two

520
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,560
would fall into his hands

521
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,960
for a second time.

522
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,000
I won't leave

523
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,480
unless you rescue my elder brother.

524
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,520
Remember that

525
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,040
over all the past years,

526
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,720
your Ou family has made a lot of money

527
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,520
with our help.

528
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,600
Stop!

529
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
Catch her!

530
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,640
I didn't expect that

531
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,400
she would leave evidence behind

532
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,440
and the evidence
would get obtained by you.

533
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,520
You killed innocent people

534
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,880
to eliminate the evidence

535
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,280
proving you colluded with the pirates.

536
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,920
So it is true that your Ou family

537
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,600
has been colluding with the pirates.

538
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,960
No wonder you have been
trying to stop us

539
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,320
regarding the sea ban
in every possible way.

540
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,200
I have been listening for quite a while.

541
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,440
It is late now.

542
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,640
It's time for you

543
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,160
to embark on your trip
to the nether world.

544
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,400
Master Lixing!

545
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Ou Lixing.

546
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,320
You finally admitted

547
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,640
your crime.

548
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,640
Ren Kun!

549
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,080
Why are you here?

550
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,800
Xu Lingyi.

551
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,880
You made a mistake

552
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,960
using my maid for you conspiracy.

553
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,320
Rise to your feet first.

554
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,200
We grew up together.

555
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,080
I know you better than others.

556
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,400
You are very kind.

557
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,200
It is impossible for you
to have done that.

558
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,880
What is your reason for doing that?

559
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,120
Tell me.

560
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,640
Your Ladyship.

561
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,480
I...

562
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,320
Silly girl.

563
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,760
As long as I can help you,

564
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,760
I am willing to do anything.

565
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,040
Help me?

566
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,680
Who taught you to say those words?

567
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,480
This matter might concern

568
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,320
the fate of the Xu family.

569
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,160
You must come clean with me.

570
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,520
It's Amber.

571
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Amber said that

572
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,520
only by saying those words,
could I help you.

573
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,000
It is impossible for Amber
to intend to harm me.

574
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,000
It is more unlikely that
she allied herself with the Ou family.

575
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,760
I am afraid that she has fallen
into others' trap.

576
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,160
If our relationship

577
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,400
is jeopardized,

578
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,080
nobody will benefit from it.

579
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,640
The wirepuller
must have subsequent plans.

580
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,560
Well, what should we do for the next?

581
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,600
This stratagem seems to

582
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,160
depend on Dongqing.

583
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,800
But actually, it is up to

584
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,480
your reaction and action.

585
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,960
You'd better
take a wait-and-see approach

586
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,040
to gain the initiative.

587
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,120
I will arrange
trustworthy people of our family

588
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,760
to coordinate with you.

589
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,840
Are you suspecting Amber as well,

590
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,280
Mr. Ou?

591
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,400
Going through so many things,

592
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,040
I have faith in the personality
of Marquis Yongping.

593
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,000
Even if he is condemned by everybody,

594
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,080
he won't

595
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
take Dongqing as his concubine

596
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,600
to hurt you.

597
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,280
Based on your personality,

598
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,640
even if you have to leave the Xu family,

599
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
you won't turn to me for help.

600
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,840
Because if you do that,
Marquis Yongping will be hurt.

601
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,360
So it is confusing for Amber

602
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,480
to take this action.

603
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,560
Mr. Ou still held expectations for you

604
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,000
at first.

605
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,240
He thought

606
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,120
you would not be so vicious.

607
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,480
It is a pity that

608
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,640
he thought too positively of you.

609
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,440
Ou Yanxing,

610
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,640
how could you collude
with the Xu family to frame me?

611
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,080
Lixing.

612
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,520
Believe it or not,

613
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,400
I never meant to hurt you

614
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,600
and to fight for power with you.

615
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,360
I hope strongly that

616
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,960
Marquis Yongping has misjudged you.

617
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,080
I didn't stop hoping till now that

618
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,640
you would not show up.

619
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,040
It is you who forced yourself

620
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,040
to take this road of desperation.

621
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,360
Don't be phony!

622
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,280
If you don't want to
fight for power with me,

623
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,040
why have you given up

624
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,120
your life of sightseeing

625
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,920
and returned to our Ou family?

626
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,600
Why have you showed up

627
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,080
time and again in front of our father?

628
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,400
Why have you reminded father that

629
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,680
he has failed your mother?

630
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,280
Why,

631
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,960
why have you turned father against me?

632
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,320
I am not turning father against you.

633
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,080
It is you yourself.

634
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,760
If I can stay alive,

635
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,080
I will kill you with my own hands.

636
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,560
Ou Lixing,

637
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,760
you will have no chance to do that.

638
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,680
Now we have both
human witnesses and material evidence.

639
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,640
What awaits you ahead is only
the severe punishment by laws.

640
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,320
Move! Retreat!

641
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,150
Protect Shiyi!

642
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,670
Be careful, My Lord!

643
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,120
Linbo, the bow and arrows!

644
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,080
You kept a private army,
colluded with the pirates,

645
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,320
as well as tried to
trap and kill court officials.

646
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,640
You can't be absolved from your crime.

647
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Ou Lixing,

648
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,000
you have committed such serious crime.

649
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,520
Marquis Jingyuan is in
a hopeless situation now.

650
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,800
You want to bring down
my family using me.

651
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,520
Move!

652
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,000
-Get on your knees!
-Kneel down!

653
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,560
In father's eyes,

654
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,720
I am much inferior to you.

655
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,720
See clearly now

656
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,360
who deserves to be
the son of our Ou family!

657
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,160
Lixing!

658
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,240
Lixing!

659
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,960
Lixing!

660
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,840
My dear wife,

661
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,800
I will break my promise.

662
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,880
Are you all right?

663
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,120
Linbo,

664
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,640
take all captives
to the Ministry of Justice for trial.

665
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,280
Yes, My Lord.

666
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,240
They all committed suicide, My Lord.

667
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,640
Now we lost all witnesses.

668
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,280
Will Marquis Jingyuan
make countercharges against us?

669
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,040
If he doesn't want to be accused of

670
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,160
maintaining an army for rebellion,

671
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,880
he won't
make this matter public for sure.

672
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,120
I am sorry.

673
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,360
I never expected this matter

674
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,040
would end up like this.

675
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,880
We intended to subdue him

676
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,480
and bring him
to trial pursuant to the law.

677
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,160
- It is unexpected that...
-I know.

678
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
He has got what he deserved.

679
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,880
He is a real man.

680
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,720
It is a pity that
he was born into the Ou family.

681
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,400
It is really surprising that

682
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,200
Luo Shiyi

683
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,040
has done

684
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,120
such an indecent and shameless thing.

685
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,360
If I had known this,

686
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,720
I would not have allowed her

687
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,600
to marry into our Xu family.

688
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,640
This matter is still unclear.

689
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,920
His Lordship has gone
to chase Shiyi.

690
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,760
Let's wait for them to come back.

691
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,600
If this matter turns out to be true,

692
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,000
I will not forgive her, no matter what.

693
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,460
(Mansion of Xu)

694
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,560
Great Madam, His Lordship is back.

695
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,160
Mother, His Lordship is back.

696
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
Greetings to you, Mother.

697
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,160
Why do you still
have the face to come back?

698
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,680
Servants!

699
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,040
Drive her out!

700
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,120
Lingyi.

701
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,280
How could she do such a thing?

702
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,280
Why are you still defending her?

703
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,120
Mother.

704
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
There are reasons for her to do that.

705
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,160
Shiyi ran away purposefully.

706
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,080
It is our plan.

707
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,360
Just now,

708
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,080
Ou Lixing died.

709
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,640
An unjust man is doomed to destruction.

710
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,480
Ou Lixing

711
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,080
just got the punishment he deserved.

712
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,160
Shiyi,

713
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,200
I have granted you
three days to think about it.

714
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,400
Now I want to know your choice.

715
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,040
Mother.

716
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,200
I know you are determined to

717
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,600
safeguard our Xu family.

718
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,320
But Dongqing is my maid.

719
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,520
Whether she will be married off or sold,

720
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,160
only I can decide that.

721
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,560
I won't exchange her life

722
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,200
for anything.

723
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,400
Lingyi.

724
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,840
What is your thought?

725
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,800
She is my wife.

726
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,160
Of course,

727
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,480
I will respect her decision.

728
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,240
You can't forget that

729
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,360
the ethical rules
governing human relations

730
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,400
were passed down to us

731
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,000
by our ancestors.

732
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,240
It is the foundation for our Xu family

733
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,960
to survive in this world.

734
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,040
Mother, please make wise judgment.

735
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,800
As the saying goes,
as time goes by, things change.

736
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,480
So the rules must be changed over time.

737
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,160
We mustn't apply ancient rules
to modern times.

738
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,920
Otherwise,

739
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,880
back then, father and Ling'an

740
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,680
needn't have opposed firmly
the ancestral policies

741
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,280
and advocated persistently
the lift of the sea ban.

742
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,080
Mother, do you think

743
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,760
father and Ling'an
were also wrong?

744
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,040
Do you think I am wrong, too?

745
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,640
Lifting the sea ban is for the good
of our state and people.

746
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,240
It is a lofty deed.

747
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,360
It can't be

748
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,760
put on a par with

749
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,440
the small Xianling Pavilion.

750
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,320
Don't do bad things
even if they are petty.

751
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,080
Don't hesitate to do good things
even if they are minor.

752
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,960
In Xianling Pavilion,

753
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,120
Shiyi helped the refugees,

754
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,560
taught them embroidery skills

755
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,800
and enabled those homeless people

756
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,600
to be skilled in some kind of work

757
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,080
and to make a living.

758
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,680
This has also ridded the imperial court

759
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,280
of extra worries and troubles.

760
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,320
Isn't such a deed

761
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,560
also in the interest
of the state and the people?

762
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,240
Why must Shiyi be fettered
by old conventions

763
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,480
just because she is a woman?

764
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,280
Will this really be conducive to

765
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,120
the prosperity of our Xu family?

766
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,680
Mother, please lay your hand
on your heart and ask yourself.

767
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,840
After Shiyi managed
the household affairs,

768
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,920
has she ever neglected her duties

769
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,320
because of Xianling Pavilion?

770
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,120
Why must you
force her to give it up, Mother?

771
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,160
So do you mean that

772
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,680
I am wrong?

773
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,040
Dongqing is a pure-minded maid.

774
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,360
But you forced Shiyi

775
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,640
with Dongqing's fate as the chip

776
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,200
to achieve you aim.

777
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,520
This is a wrong deed.

778
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,520
I,

779
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,680
I did this for the sake
of our Xu family.

780
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,120
You must remember

781
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,520
I am your mother.

782
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,960
Mother,

783
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,280
I am not only your son,

784
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,440
but also Shiyi's husband.

785
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,400
Hereby I vow that

786
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,840
in all my life,

787
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,600
I won't take any concubines.

788
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,520
Mother,

789
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,520
I also vow that

790
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
like Lingyi,

791
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,680
I will not take any concubines
from today onward

792
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,440
and will be devoted to Danyang.

793
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Why are you also doing this?

794
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,080
Mother.

795
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
To bring glory to our Xu family,

796
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,000
Lingyi has sacrificed a lot

797
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,800
and has shed blood and sweat.

798
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,120
Doesn't he

799
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,840
deserve a chance to

800
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,160
decide his own matter?

801
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,280
Lingyi has risked his life

802
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,280
to earn today's status of our Xu family.

803
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,680
In terms of feelings, reason or justice,

804
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,920
Mother,

805
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,840
you must listen to
Lingyi this time.

806
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,480
Mother,

807
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,240
after Shiyi married
into our family,

808
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,640
she got deprived of her power

809
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,040
by Qiao Lianfang

810
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,760
and became the laughingstock
of the capital.

811
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,440
But she never complained.

812
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,920
And in the case of the moldy rice,

813
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,520
she sold her dowry

814
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,800
to help our Xu family out of trouble.

815
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,640
She requited injustice with kindness.

816
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,360
Zhun is your eldest legitimate grandson.

817
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,440
If Shiyi hadn't

818
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,680
found the cause of his disease
in a timely manner

819
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,880
and taken care of him carefully,

820
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,600
he would not have recovered his health.

821
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,280
Later, Shiyi also

822
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,880
revealed the truth
of late Her Ladyship's death.

823
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,040
She also helped the refugees
in Xianling Pavilion

824
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,800
to bring honor to our Xu family.

825
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,160
Can't all these good deeds

826
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,440
get her rewarded

827
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,440
with a life she wants?

828
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,840
Mother,

829
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,240
aren't you too harsh on her

830
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,560
by doing this?

831
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,320
Mother.

832
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,600
Since Ou Yanxing

833
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,240
has withdrawn from Xianling Pavilion,

834
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,560
I beg you to allow Shiyi

835
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,960
to continue with her work there.

836
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,920
Yizhen.

837
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,920
Am I,

838
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,640
am I really wrong?

839
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,240
As a matter of fact,

840
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,600
I am not against

841
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,360
Shiyi's work in Xianling Pavilion.

842
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,960
Back then,

843
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,160
I was just worried that

844
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,360
she might be
taken advantage of by others.

845
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,720
Now I can see

846
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,520
she and His Lordship are of one heart.

847
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,080
So nobody can affect them.

848
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,200
The Ou family has reaped what it sowed.

849
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,960
Based on the current situation,

850
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,040
I have nothing

851
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,400
to worry about anymore.

852
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,200
Mother.

853
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,720
I really see our Xu family

854
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,160
as my own home

855
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,000
and treat all members of our Xu family

856
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,480
as my own family.

857
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,920
I will never do things

858
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,400
detrimental to them.

859
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,200
Mother, please believe me.

860
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,760
Though Shiyi is the matron

861
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
of our Xu family,

862
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,840
I am also a daughter-in-law
of our Xu family.

863
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,280
I can't sit idle and do nothing.

864
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,240
From now on,

865
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,520
I will assist Shiyi
to manage the household affairs.

866
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,280
Please give it your consent, Mother.

867
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,400
Such being the case,

868
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,680
just do things as you like.

869
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,040
-Thank you, Mother!
-Thanks, Mother!
