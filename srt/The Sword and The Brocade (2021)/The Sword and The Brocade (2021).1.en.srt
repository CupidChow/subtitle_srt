(Residence of Luo)

20

Your Ladyship.

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,340
Shiyi is just a kid.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,420
She knows nothing.

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,660
(Concubine Lv)
She didn't mean to break

-Please spare Shiyi.

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,660
Your Ladyship.

27
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,060
She really didn't mean to break

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,380
Yuanniang's hairpin.

29
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,700
Your Ladyship.

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,380
She didn't mean to do that.

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,300
Please spare Shiyi, Your Ladyship.

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,220
Spare Shiyi, please.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,180
Shiyi.

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,540
Shiyi.

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,780
Shiyi.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,780
I'm begging you.

37
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,620
Just apologize, won't you?

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,220
Apologize to Her Ladyship.

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,740
Will you please do that?

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,660
Shiyi.

41
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,660
Stop the flogging, please.

(Madam Luo)

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,500
Yuanniang is the daughter
of Lord Luo's wife.

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,340
Shiyi is the daughter
of Lord Luo's concubine.

45
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
They are of different status.

46
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,380
The younger ones
must respect the elder ones.

47
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,380
That's the rule.

Mother.

Mother.

52

(Luo Shiyi)

53
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,860
What's wrong?

54
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,100
What's the matter, Shiyi?

55
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,380
Mother.

56
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,900
Did you have a nightmare?

57
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,900
It's alright. It's alright.

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
You're fine.

59
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,740
I'm with you.

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,340
Don't be afraid.

61
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,580
We need to hurry up
with our journey tomorrow.

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,860
Sleep early.

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,580
Come on.

64
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,100
You're getting more and more proficient.

65
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,260
Master Jian

66
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,980
has not wasted her energy training you.

67
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,860
Do you remember this?

68
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,500
It's the first piece of embroidery

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,340
you made and gave me three years ago

70
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,860
when you just learned how to embroider.

71
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,540
I've been carrying it
with me all this time.

72
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,740
Years have passed

73
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,260
in the blink of an eye.

74
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,300
Mother, when I've finished
this piece of embroidery,

75
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,540
you'll have something new
to carry with you.

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,140
Alright.

77
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,620
The Luo Family has been ignoring us

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,260
over the past three years.

79
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,740
It doesn't even pay us
the monthly sum sometimes.

80
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,340
If Lady Shiyi hadn't been
selling her embroidery works,

81
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,980
we would have starved to death

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,420
in Yuhang.

83
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,260
On a side note,

84
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,300
Her Ladyship has summoned us

85
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,820
back to the capital out of the blue.

86
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,460
I wonder what kind of fortune awaits us.

87
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,340
Mother, don't worry.

88
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,980
I won't let you suffer anymore.

89
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,220
My Lord.

90
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,900
Proper arrangements have been made
at Yunlai Inn.

91
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,540
My Lord.

92
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,180
Will those two fugitives

93
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,220
really go there?

94
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,820
That place is a secret lair
of the Fujian pirates.

95
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,380
Jiang Huai and Liu Yong

96
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,580
intend to flee to Fujian.

97
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,380
They need help from Yunlai Inn.

98
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,820
Forgive us for our dereliction of duty.

99
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,700
What's done is done.

100
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,380
Pointing fingers is useless at this stage.

101
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,780
Now we must capture the fugitives

102
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,220
and take them to the capital

103
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,340
as soon as possible.

104
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,180
Yes.

105
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
It's getting late.

106
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,020
Dongqing.

107
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,620
Let's find an inn
and settle down for the night.

108
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,580
Take a look. Take a look.

109
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,020
(Xu Lingyi)

110
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,060
(Yunlai Inn)

111
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,500
Welcome.

112
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,620
Come in, please.

113
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,220
Be careful.

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,660
Tea is here.

115
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,340
What would you like to have?

116
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,860
(Lin Bo)

117
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,620
Crap.

118
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,740
That's their code word.

119
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,540
New guests have arrived.

120
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Miss,

121
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,700
our inn is full.

122
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,140
You can move ahead

123
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,940
and find another inn a street away.

124
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,780
Please move ahead.

125
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,740
But you have an empty table there.

126
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,420
Madam, let's go there.

127
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,140
Mother.

128
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,940
It's getting late.

129
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,580
Let's find another inn
to spend the night.

130
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,060
But...

131
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,060
How about...

132
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,060
What are you doing?!

133
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,620
Jiang Huai, let her go

134
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,820
or you will die.

135
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,660
Interesting.

136
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,260
You, the government force, will subject us

137
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,900
to a fate crueler than death
if you capture us.

138
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,620
Let us go

139
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,660
or we'll kill her

140
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,180
right now.

141
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,380
Let her go.

142
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,180
Let her go.

143
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,580
Shiyi.

144
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,660
Shiyi.

145
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,100
My Lady.

146
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,740
Chief. Let's ride the horses.

147
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,980
Cross the bridge.

148
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,940
Shiyi.

149
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,340
Be careful.

150
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,180
My Lady.

151
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,300
My Lord.

152
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,460
My Lord.

153
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,660
Come on.

154
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,420
-Shiyi.
-My Lady.

155
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,780
Shiyi.

156
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,460
Shiyi.

157
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,580
Move.

158
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,340
Chief, what should we do now?

159
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,660
Tell them to get out of our way,

160
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,340
or I'll kill her

161
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,020
right now.

162
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,140
-Shiyi.
-My Lady.

163
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,500
My Lady.

164
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,460
My Lady.

165
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,540
Watch out, My Lady.

166
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,540
Don't injure her.

167
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,740
Capture them.

168
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,860
Hurry up and capture them.

169
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,700
Young Master, something seems to have happened.

170
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,860
Young Master, someone has fallen into the water.

171
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,060
I'll go help.

172
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,620
Young Master.

173
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,660
Shiyi.

174
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,460
You got us so worried.

175
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,460
Shiyi.

176
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,940
(Dongqing)
My Lady, you're finally awake.

177
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
How are you feeling?

178
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
I'm alright.

179
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,820
Be careful.

180
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,940
Where am I?

181
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,020
You're in the inn.

182
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,580
Thank goodness, a kind young man

183
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,260
saved you earlier.

184
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,180
Because you tried to save me,

185
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,380
you were held hostage by the criminals.

186
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,060
If you were

187
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,140
killed,

188
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,940
I'd lose the will to live.

189
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,340
Mother, it's over now.

190
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,780
Rest at ease.

191
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,100
I wonder what kind of official

192
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,340
that man is.

193
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
I've never seen

194
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,180
an official act with
such a disregard for human life.

195
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,940
They released the arrows

196
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,300
when you were

197
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,980
still held hostage by the criminals.

198
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,060
If that arrow

199
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,260
had hit a little off the mark,

200
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,780
you would be...

201
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,100
That man is cold and ruthless.

202
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,060
But if he hadn't acted with decisiveness,

203
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,060
I wouldn't have come through.

204
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,140
Alright. Alright.

205
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,380
Drink the ginger soup now.

206
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,740
Warm yourself up.

207
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,940
I failed to protect the innocent hostage

208
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,460
and almost injured her.

209
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,420
If you hadn't arrived in time,

210
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,700
I'd have made a grave mistake.

211
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,540
It was not entirely your fault.

212
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,780
But

213
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,380
why didn't you let me

214
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,580
explain the situation to them?

215
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,700
You got injured

216
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,700
for saving her,

217
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,260
yet they only remember the arrow you shot.

218
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,020
You're getting blamed wrongly.

219
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,460
They were endangered and frightened

220
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,140
because we failed to
carry out the operation.

221
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,940
It's fortunate enough

222
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,140
that they are safe.

223
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,980
My Lord,

224
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,260
the other pirate Liu Yong

225
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,220
escaped amid the chaos.

226
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,900
We haven't

227
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,220
found him yet.

228
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,820
Pass my order
to the nearby county governments:

229
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,060
assist us in searching for the pirate.

230
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,700
Yes, My Lord.

231
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,340
Don't worry, My Lord.

232
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,860
Liu Yong won't get away.

233
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,900
You and I both know

234
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,100
he'll be brought to justice

235
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,100
sooner or later.

236
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,340
But capturing him

237
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,580
is not our ultimate goal.

238
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,780
My Lady,

239
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,300
that's the young man who saved you.

240
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,860
(So he rescued me)

241
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,580
(from the water.)

242
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,540
I am Luo Shiyi.

243
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,100
Thank you for saving my life.

244
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
No worries.

245
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,660
Actually, someone else

246
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,660
rescued you that day.

247
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,580
I simply lent a hand.

248
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,260
In any case,

249
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,580
I should thank you.

250
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,940
May I know your name?

251
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,380
(Lin Shixian)

252
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,540
I am Lin Shixian.

253
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,380
Mr. Lin.

254
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,500
With the water you inhaled,

255
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,020
be sure to have enough rest.

256
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,180
Young Master.

257
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
It's getting late.

258
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,220
We should take to the road.

259
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,980
Take care, Lady Luo.

260
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,900
See you around.

261
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,900
(The Capital)

262
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,380
(Auspicious Abundance)

263
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,460
Remember to come again.

264
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,020
Her Ladyship ordered me

265
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,780
to pick you up here.

266
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,420
Thank you, Nanny Xu.

267
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,340
(Xianling Pavilion)

268
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,380
Mother.

269
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,580
We've arrived at Xianling Pavilion.

270
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,300
I want to see my teacher first.

271
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,700
I don't know when I'll get to come out

272
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
and visit her

273
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,460
if I miss this opportunity.

274
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,540
Shiyi.

275
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,820
I know you two feel a deep attachment
to each other.

276
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,380
But we just came to the capital,

277
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,420
we should be cautious.

278
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,620
Don't give people
any excuse to condemn us.

279
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
It's alright.

280
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,860
Nanny Xu,

281
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,700
can we stop at Xianling Pavilion?

282
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,980
I want to see my teacher.

283
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,900
But...

284
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,980
Right. Please, come back soon.

285
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,540
Her Ladyship is waiting for you at home.

286
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,580
This riverside embroidery painting

287
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,820
had been pre-ordered.

288
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,820
(Master Jian)
If you like it,

289
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,940
please give me a couple of days

290
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,940
to make an exact copy.

291
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,700
(Delicate Meticulousness)

292
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,940
I want this one.

293
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,500
I want that new one too.

294
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,660
(Wang Yu)

295
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,620
Master Jian,

296
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
you are something of a beauty.

297
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,140
How about you

298
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,460
take your embroidery works
and come home with me?

299
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,620
I'll keep you company
while you embroider.

300
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,660
Please respect yourself.

301
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,980
So you prefer the rough treatment.

302
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,900
Take her home along with the paintings.

303
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,580
Yes.

304
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,100
How dare you!

305
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,780
Stop.

306
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,540
Shi...

307
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,420
Master Jian.

308
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,940
Our Madam Luo sent me here to ask you

309
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,500
whether the riverside
embroidery painting

310
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,700
she ordered has been completed.

311
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,580
Of course it has been completed.

312
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,540
I said

313
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,620
that painting is mine.

314
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,100
Come to the Wang Family's property for it

315
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,460
if you dare.

316
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,740
Our Madam Xu might not

317
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,300
be able to visit you,

318
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,020
but Sir, the Marquis will

319
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,020
if you don't mind.

320
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,580
You've got a sharp tongue.

321
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,460
For what family do you work?

322
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,340
Listen up.

323
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,660
My lord is Xu Lingyi,

324
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,980
Marquis Yongping.

325
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,500
Marquis Yongping?

326
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
That carriage

327
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,260
is the Luo Family's carriage.

328
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,340
The eldest lady of the Luo Family

329
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,740
is the wife of Marquis Yongping.

330
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,980
I'm sure

331
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,820
you know that.

332
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,220
Sir,

333
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,860
the carriage outside
does belong to the Luo Family.

334
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,700
I don't need you to remind me.

335
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,700
Master Jian,

336
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,580
I'm letting you off

337
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,220
not because I'm scared of Xu Lingyi.

338
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,500
I just don't want

339
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,100
to lower myself to a fighter's level.

340
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,420
We'll settle this another day.

341
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Shiyi.

342
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,220
Teacher.

343
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,260
Shiyi.

344
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:39,940
I haven't seen you in a long time.

345
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,860
Take a seat.

346
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,580
Teacher,

347
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,260
who was that?

348
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
He acted in such conceit.

349
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,740
That was Wang Yu, the heir of Duke Mao.

350
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,980
He is infamous for
his debauchery in the capital.

351
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,620
If his family hadn't gone downhill,

352
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,380
he might have done something worse.

353
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,500
His family was bound to go downhill

354
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,820
with a degenerate like him.

355
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,740
Why did you

356
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,500
suddenly come back?

357
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,220
Her Ladyship has summoned us

358
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,860
back to the capital out of the blue

359
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,140
without telling us why.

360
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,340
I feel somewhat uneasy.

361
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,180
Now that I think about it,

362
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,980
you've reached the age of fifteen.

363
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Madam Luo

364
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,820
probably wants to arrange

365
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,300
a marriage for you.

366
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,380
She has always seen me and my mother

367
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,500
as thorns in her flesh.

368
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,260
She'd never arrange
a good marriage for me.

369
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
Besides,

370
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,180
I've seen too much

371
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,060
deception in the Luo Family.

372
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,460
It makes me unwilling to get married.

373
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,580
I wish to stay single

374
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
and free

375
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,540
like you.

376
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,180
Silly girl,

377
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,820
you are not aware of the pain

378
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,300
behind my freedom.

379
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Remember,

380
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,580
don't rush to make any decision.

381
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,260
I don't care if my future is bright

382
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,580
or full of dangers and difficulties,

383
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,100
I won't regret

384
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,180
my choices.

385
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Well-said.

386
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,220
No matter what you do,

387
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,900
I will do my best

388
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,420
to support you.

389
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,180
Teacher,

390
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,820
I know life in the capital

391
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,420
won't be easy.

392
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,700
I'm already hard up

393
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,420
and I'll need money
to spend in the future.

394
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,980
Would you sell my embroidery works

395
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,460
for me,

396
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,740
so I could make ends meet?

397
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,620
No problem.

398
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,420
Just bring the embroidery works

399
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,700
here for me to sell.

400
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
Thank you.

401
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,460
(Residence of Luo)

402
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,460
(Residence of Luo)

403
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,540
I pay my respects to you, Your Ladyship.

404
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,500
You look fine.

405
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,780
The beautiful landscape of Yuhang

406
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,620
suited you better as I expected.

407
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,900
Thank you for your kindness.

408
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,700
Your Ladyship, look,

409
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,180
only three years have passed

410
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,740
and Shiyi

411
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,540
has grown

412
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,540
prettier

413
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,300
and demurer.

414
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,580
(Concubine Yang)
She probably won't trouble you

415
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,220
as much as she once did.

416
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,420
Mother,

417
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,580
I have kept your teachings in mind

418
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,620
over the past three years.

419
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
Now that I have returned,

420
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,300
I'll talk and act cautiously

421
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,700
and not let you down.

422
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,500
You really have become more prudent.

423
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,620
Get up.

424
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,340
-Thank you, Your Ladyship.
-Thank you, Mother.

425
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,660
I heard that you

426
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,980
ran into criminals on your way here.

427
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,540
Did you get hurt?

428
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,220
Thank you for your concern.

429
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,820
We just got a scare.

430
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,260
Amber,

431
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,180
pack your stuff

432
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,260
and start serving Lady Shiyi

433
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,260
from now on.

434
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,940
(Amber)

435
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,300
You have too few

436
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,620
handmaids.

437
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,180
Yes.

438
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,820
Mother, that won't do.

439
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,660
Amber is your capable assistant.

440
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,780
Who will serve you

441
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,100
if she starts serving me?

442
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,580
His lordship is back.

443
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,460
I pay my respects to you, My Lord.

444
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,740
Qingtong.

445
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,100
(Lord Luo)

446
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,460
You're back.

447
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,580
Yes, My Lord.

448
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,860
My Lord.

449
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,620
I pay my respects to you, father.

450
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,860
How was your journey?

451
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,340
Thank you for your concern.

452
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,180
We had a small incident
on the way and got a scare,

453
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,740
but we came through, thankfully.

454
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,820
Good. Good.

455
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,260
Have you got a place to stay?

456
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,620
If you need anything,

457
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,820
tell your mother.

458
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,300
Don't worry, My Lord.

459
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,820
I have made arrangements.

460
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,260
I have also sent Amber

461
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
to serve her.

462
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,340
Great.

463
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,580
Tell the kitchen staffs to prepare
a slew of seasonal dishes

464
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,740
for the welcome dinner
for Shiyi and the others.

465
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
-Thank you, father.
-Thank you, My Lord.

466
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,380
The long journey
must have exhausted them.

467
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,980
Let them go and rest.

468
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,340
You're dismissed.

469
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,020
Yes.

470
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,220
My Lord.

471
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,060
What happened?

472
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,100
My teacher argued with

473
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,060
Grand Secretary Chen about tea taxes.

474
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,700
In a rage, he asked to resign

475
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,740
and His Majesty approved.

476
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,700
What?

477
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,820
That's shocking news.

478
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,980
Does it mean

479
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,340
you won't be reinstated?

480
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
Don't worry too much.

481
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,660
Marquis Yongping
has come back to the capital.

482
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,180
His elimination of the bandits
is a feat.

483
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,540
I don't think the court

484
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,260
will try too hard to stop me

485
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,500
from getting my position back.

486
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Good.

487
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,460
The furnishings in this room

488
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,660
are so nice.

489
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,380
My Lady,

490
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,540
is this table

491
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,180
made of rosewood?

492
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,460
Has Her Ladyship turned?

493
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,460
Watch your mouth.

494
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,580
Dongqing is right.

495
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,380
It seems the reason behind

496
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,780
the summoning is not simple.

497
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,820
Greetings, Madam.

498
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,940
Hello, Lady Erniang.

499
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,020
Hello, Lady Wuniang.

500
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,020
Let me make tea for you.

501
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,740
Sister Erniang, sister Wuniang.

502
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,100
Shiyi.

503
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,060
We haven't seen you in a long time.

504
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,260
The furnishings in your room

505
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,860
are much fancier

506
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,060
than those in our rooms.

507
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
I envy you so much.

508
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,460
It's not worth your envy.

509
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,900
(Luo Erniang)
Mother picked a good man

510
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,020
(Luo Erniang)
for you to marry.

511
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,700
That's enviable.

512
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,060
Congratulations

513
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,300
on your desirable marriage.

514
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,020
I wonder

515
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,420
who this

516
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
lucky man is.

517
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,980
You're too kind.

518
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,780
(Luo Wuniang)
He is not high-born.

519
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,940
He is our eldest brother's schoolmate
at the Imperial College.

520
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,700
But he is modest and gentle.

521
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,060
He treats me well.

522
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,580
Shiyi,

523
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,820
just be obedient

524
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,060
and this family

525
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,380
will find you a good man too.

526
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,660
Understood?

527
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,260
Your room

528
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,180
may have new furnishings,

529
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,020
but it lacks an air of elegance.

530
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,860
I created a calligraphic work for you.

531
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,020
Let Dongqing hang it up.

532
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,180
(Reeds on the walls,
bamboo shoots in the mountains)

533
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,020
Thank you for thinking of me.

534
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,460
And thank you for this gift.

535
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,420
You have traveled a long way.

536
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,980
Rest early.

537
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,980
Don't forget

538
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,660
to pay your respects to mother tomorrow.

539
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,260
Yes.

540
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,540
I'll get going.

541
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,340
My Lady,

542
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
she was so pompous,

543
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,060
as if her status

544
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,860
was second only

545
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,700
to that of Her Ladyship's.

546
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,540
Alright.

547
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,620
Don't lower yourself to her level.

548
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,980
I just can't stand

549
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,380
her smugness.

550
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,540
My Lady,

551
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,060
what do these words mean?

552
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,140
Top-heavy and uncultivated

553
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,820
like the reeds on the wall.

554
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,580
Sharp-tongued, thick-skinned and hollow

555
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,540
like the bamboo shoots in the mountains.

556
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,180
Dammit.

557
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,580
I knew she meant ill.

558
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,580
I'm going to burn it

559
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,420
and piss her off.

560
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
Alright.

561
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,500
Don't be mad.

562
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,460
Hurry up and put this away.

563
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,980
Don't give people
any excuse to condemn us.

564
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,020
Where are they?

565
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,060
They left?

566
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,540
What's the matter, Shiyi?

567
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,700
Erniang wasn't exactly close to me

568
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,820
the last time I lived here.

569
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,580
But she'd never been arrogant

570
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,820
and relentless toward me

571
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,740
like she was today.

572
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,860
Have we been summoned back

573
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,940
because something abnormal?

574
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,580
I'll find out the answer tomorrow

575
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,620
when I pay my respects.

576
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,340
Otherwise,
we'll miss the best opportunities

577
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,860
and come under other people's control.

578
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Your Ladyship.

579
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,980
Which hairpin
would you like to wear today?

580
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,900
This one.

581
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,860
Your Ladyship.

582
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,420
The ladies have come

583
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,780
to pay their respects to you.

584
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,820
Her Ladyship is being groomed.

585
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,180
Tell the ladies to wait for a while.

586
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,500
Let them in.

587
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,860
Yes.

588
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,500
I pay my respects to you, mother.

589
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,700
You came at a good time.

590
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,860
I'm torn between the hairpins.

591
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,740
Which one should I wear today?

592
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,340
Erniang,

593
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,700
I have faith in your taste.

594
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,060
Pick a hairpin for me.

595
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,820
Mother,

596
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,700
you've been treating me with kindness

597
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,780
and letting me
learn the skills of embroidery.

598
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,700
It's time for me to serve you.

599
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,260
Let me help you pick a hairpin.

600
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,060
Mother,

601
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,860
Shiyi has been away from you

602
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,140
in the past few years.

603
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,900
She doesn't know your preferences.

604
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,340
Your skin is fair and smooth

605
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,580
and your hair is silky and shiny.

606
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,260
Gorgeous bright-colored accessories

607
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,020
suit you the best.

608
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,860
This hairpin with gold wires,
eight gems and pearls

609
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,300
does the best job at highlighting

610
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,820
your dignified and graceful beauty.

611
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,860
Shiyi,

612
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,620
what do you think?

613
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,660
The hairstyle you sport today

614
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,060
seems to match the velvet peony

615
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,100
more than anything.

616
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,140
The velvet peony

617
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,620
can flatter your nobility
and elegance better.

618
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,180
What do you think?

619
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,180
Good. Good.

620
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,180
You know me the best.

621
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,260
I love it.

622
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,940
But I'm not

623
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,940
as young as you.

624
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,100
The peony looks gaudy on me.

625
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,420
No way.

626
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,900
You are the peony.

627
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,140
We are just the flower buds

628
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,100
around you.

629
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,660
We grew up

630
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,220
under your care.

631
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,060
Therefore,

632
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,940
this peony suits you the best.

633
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,900
You're so thoughtful.

634
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,260
Alright.

635
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,820
I'll wear it then.

636
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,340
Yes.

637
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,180
You're in your prime

638
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,580
and you look gorgeous.

639
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,740
The peony

640
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,740
suits you the best.

641
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,500
Since you see yourselves

642
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,620
as flower buds,

643
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,660
I'll take you out

644
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,340
for some sunlight

645
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,260
and to expand your horizons.

646
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,300
Come with me to
the Xu Family's spring banquet

647
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,900
on the third day of March.

648
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

649
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,260
Alright. I'm tired.

650
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,740
You're dismissed.

651
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

652
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,740
Shiyi,

653
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,900
you've grown much wittier

654
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,900
over the past three years.

655
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,500
You've been back for less than a day

656
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,420
and you've already pleased Mother.

657
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,580
She's even decided to take you

658
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,700
to our brother-in-law's spring banquet.

659
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,340
Because she is kind enough

660
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,900
to expand

661
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,060
our horizons.

662
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,180
Yeah.

663
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,380
Mother has not only a kind heart,

664
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,060
but also good judgment.

665
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,860
She can see right through

666
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,980
those who

667
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,900
harbor despicable thoughts.

668
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,260
I suggest somebody should

669
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,340
grow some awareness
of their humble status,

670
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,700
before fawning on their superiors.

671
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,820
You can't have both prizes.

672
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,420
Insatiable greed is most unwanted.

673
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,340
Enough with your sarcasm.

674
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,020
What exactly do you mean?

675
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:30,980
I'm sure Shiyi knows

676
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,300
what I mean.

677
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,220
You want to compete with me?

678
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,740
You don't have what it takes.

679
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,580
I suggest

680
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,380
you lay low

681
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,420
and wait for a good marriage.

682
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,340
What did she mean?

683
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,380
She was talking in riddles.

684
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,860
She even mentioned marriage.

685
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,100
Has your marriage

686
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
been arranged already?

687
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,140
Does she know something?

688
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,180
The important thing is to
visit our eldest sister.

689
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,420
I need to get back and prepare myself.

690
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,860
You should

691
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,900
prepare yourself too.

692
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,020
Yes.

693
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,900
My Lady.

694
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,860
You told me

695
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,620
not to lower myself to her level.

696
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Why did you do the opposite?

697
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,220
Silly girl,

698
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,500
if I hadn't done that,

699
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,460
Erniang wouldn't have

700
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,180
given away so much information.

701
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,300
So

702
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,700
you irritated her on purpose.

703
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,860
Erniang is Her Ladyship's favorite daughter.

704
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,780
She is definitely
the most well-informed person.

705
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,500
We needed to make her

706
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,060
come forward with information

707
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,940
instead of throwing questions

708
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,380
at her aimlessly.

709
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,420
But what did she reveal today?

710
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,660
I didn't understand anything she said.

711
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,180
Her Ladyship summoned me back

712
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,700
to arrange my marriage

713
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,700
and Erniang's marriage.

714
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,140
Marriage?

715
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,460
Who will you marry?

716
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,780
She meant "two men" by "two prizes".

717
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,300
She despises one of them,

718
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,900
whom she thinks

719
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,420
as a match for me perfectly.

720
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,740
She eagerly wants the other one

721
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,940
and is determined to marry him.

722
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,820
Because he is of higher social status,

723
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,340
she fears

724
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,100
I may compete with her.

725
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,060
It seems

726
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,740
the man arranged for you

727
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,060
is very undesirable.

728
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,140
After Her Ladyship said

729
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,700
she'd take us to the Xu Family,

730
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,860
Erniang couldn't help herself.

731
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,900
The Xu Family's spring banquet

732
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,460
must be the key.

733
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,940
Vested with authority by heaven,

734
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,940
the emperor has issued an edict:

735
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,940
The empire rewards anyone

736
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,460
who performed great feats.

737
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,740
Xu Lingyi, Marquis Yongping

738
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,820
and the Grand General
of Westward Conquest,

739
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,980
has eliminated bandits, quelled riots,

740
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,540
shown his loyalty
and performed a great feat.

741
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,260
He has proven to be
a competent official.

742
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,900
(Imperial Edict)
He will be rewarded with the title of

743
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,500
(Imperial Edict)
Imperial Tutor of the Second Standard Rank.

744
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,700
Respect this edict.

745
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

746
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,060
Grand Secretary,

747
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,940
Marquis Yongping's
elimination of the pirates

748
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,780
is a great feat indeed.

749
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,820
But he failed to guard
the leaders of the pirates

750
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,420
and let them run away.

751
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,020
He allowed them to regain freedom,

752
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,620
(Marquis Jingyuan)
which spells trouble in the future.

753
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,700
That incident has nothing to do
with Marquis Yongping.

754
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,340
I was the one...

755
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,180
Grand Secretary,

756
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,140
it was true.

757
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,980
Because I didn't guard

758
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,100
the leaders Jiang Huai

759
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
and Liu Yong well,

760
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,380
they fled.

761
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,740
But we've recaptured Jiang Huai

762
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,220
and sent troops after the other leader.

763
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,940
We won't let Liu Yong get away.

764
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,620
Although

765
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,540
most of the pirates have been eliminated,

766
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,260
riots may occur again

767
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,620
(Grand Secretary Chen)
because the leader is still alive.

768
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,140
The sea ban is the reason

769
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,020
that the pirates have been difficult

770
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,260
to wipe out.

771
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,900
Marquis Jingyuan,
have you got any great opinions?

772
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,700
Grand Secretary,

773
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,540
we didn't come here

774
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,100
for this kind

775
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,860
of groundless cliché.

776
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,580
Marquis Jingyuan,

777
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,100
when you said "groundless",

778
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,220
you were either being one-sided

779
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,300
or confusing right with wrong.

780
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,700
(Mansion of Xu)

781
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,820
His Lordship is back.

782
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,300
(Great Madam Xu)

783
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,580
My son.

784
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
I pay my respects to you, Mother.

785
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,820
My son.

786
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,620
Spare the formality.

787
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
Let me get a good look at you.

788
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,220
I've been on a Buddhist diet

789
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,260
and prayed to the Buddha
every day in the past year.

790
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,380
Now you have finally come home.

791
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,300
Lingyi,

792
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,300
do you know

793
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,460
how much we missed you?

794
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,940
Look what you have done.

795
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,660
The first thing you did upon your return
was entering the palace

796
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,460
(Xu Lingkuan)
and reporting on your mission, not coming home.

797
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,420
Because I went on an expedition
on His Majesty's order,

798
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,740
I must report on my mission
upon my return to the capital

799
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,980
before coming home.

800
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,180
You've made no progress,
incompetent boy.

801
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,860
Lingyi.

802
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,220
What made you reproach him
when you just came home?

803
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,220
Lingkuan has been well-behaved at home.

804
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,100
He caused no trouble.

805
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,180
Yizhen.

806
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,860
Mother. Where is my wife?

807
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,860
Yuanniang...

808
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,700
Yuanniang has become

809
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,820
even sicker recently.

810
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,620
You should go

811
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,140
and check on her.

812
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,540
I'll go right away.

813
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,220
Yes.

814
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,740
(Luo Yuanniang)

815
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,180
My Lord.

816
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,980
I pay my respects to you.

817
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,420
You're ill.

818
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,620
You can skip the formality.

819
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,060
Zhun.

820
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,620
You cried for your father

821
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,980
just now.

822
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,860
Now your father is back.

823
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,700
Greet him.

824
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,300
(Xu Sizhun)

825
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,260
Father.

826
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Let me take a look at you.

827
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,740
Concubine Wen and
Concubine Qin are here.

828
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,620
I pay my respects to you,
Your Lordship and Your Ladyship.

829
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,780
(Xu Siyu)
I pay my respects to you, Father.

830
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,020
Spare the formality.

831
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,460
Take a seat.

832
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,700
When you were away,

833
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,860
I was...

834
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,060
(Concubine Wen)

835
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,100
Yu

836
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,900
studied even harder than before.

837
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,220
Even the teacher commended Yu

838
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,780
for his good writing.

839
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,140
Good.

840
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,340
Zhun studied hard too.

841
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,140
Zhun, go up.

842
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,580
Zhun.

843
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,060
How well did you do at school
in the past year?

844
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
Have you made any progress?

845
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,180
Zhun.

846
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,940
Recite a paragraph to your father.

847
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,540
My Lord.

848
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,860
Zhun is still young.

849
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,140
He is feeling a little shy

850
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,420
around so many people.

851
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,020
My Lord,

852
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,580
you have performed another great feat.

853
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,540
Has His Majesty rewarded you

854
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,940
with anything other than
the title of Imperial Tutor?

855
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,140
When His Majesty

856
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,580
proposed to confer one more title
of nobility on me, I turned him down.
