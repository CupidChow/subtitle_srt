=Episode 26=

19
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,140
They had such

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,460
a big fight.

21
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,980
Why doesn't His Lordship

22
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,620
divorce her?

23
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,580
Do you think the maid

24
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,980
of the Luo family was lying?

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,820
I don't think so.

26
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,060
Many people of the Luo family
witnessed that.

27
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,500
It's said

28
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,380
that Her Ladyship made
His Lordship furious.

29
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,900
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have come back alone.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm just worried that His Lordship will

31
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,420
forgive her again
if it drags on any longer.

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,700
Madam, don't worry.

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,780
Now that Mingjing has left,

34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,220
no one will link the death of

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,740
late Her Ladyship to us.

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,380
Luo Shiyi

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,060
will never be able to come back.

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,900
Sooner or later,
His Lordship will divorce her.

39
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,060
A long delay may cause trouble.

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,340
I still can't feel at ease.

41
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,460
Looks like

42
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,180
I have to give His Lordship a nudge.

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,900
Usually,

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,100
I would ask
the master of Xianling Pavilion

45
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,940
to make me a unique embroidery

46
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,460
to go with this bracelet.

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,540
That would be the best.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,180
Exactly.

49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,420
What a pity.

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,620
I'm afraid we can't go

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
to Xianling Pavilion any longer.

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,540
Why can't we?

53
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,660
Anything happened?

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,980
The news has been widely spread.

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,180
You still haven't heard?

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,980
Madam Xu took in

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,660
many refugees and trained them

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,540
to be embroidery girls.

59
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,620
But in reality,

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,340
she bullied those refugees

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,260
under the name of Marquis Yongping.

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,900
The refugees created total chaos
because of this.

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,340
Really?

64
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,140
It'll be hard

65
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,900
for Xianling Pavilion

66
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,660
to get back to business.

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,140
Furthermore,

68
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,020
the good name of Marquis Yongping

69
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,380
will be destroyed completely.

70
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,740
(Mansion of Xu)

71
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,660
Marquis Yongping is also involved?

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,860
I know what kind of person
the Marquis is.

73
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
And his wife

74
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,460
doesn't seem to be

75
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,300
a reckless woman.

76
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,540
What happened exactly?

77
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,180
The rumor has

78
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,860
been spread to everywhere.

79
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,260
This Luo Shiyi

80
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,820
has made our Xu family

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,660
a target of public censure.

82
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,740
Is it really Madam Xu
who caused the trouble?

83
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,980
Sister,

84
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,060
listen to me.

85
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,860
You have to fix this problem quickly.

86
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,420
If people with bad intention

87
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,460
distort the truth

88
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,540
and report this to His Majesty,

89
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,620
your family will be in big trouble.

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,140
Of course I know that.

91
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,380
But...

92
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,620
You mean

93
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,260
our Xu family wronged her?

94
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,620
Marquis,

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,300
how could you say that?

96
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,700
You are suspicious of Shiyi?

97
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,420
You don't trust her?

98
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,220
I asked you to be here
for one thing only.

99
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,380
(Divorce Agreement)

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,620
Take this

101
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,860
Divorce Agreement back.

102
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,860
From now on,

103
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,220
Xu family will have nothing to do

104
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,980
with Luo family.

105
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,420
Marquis, are you really
going to divorce Shiyi?

106
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,580
Xu Lingyi.

107
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,020
Don't think you can
push around Luo family.

108
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,500
How dare you?

109
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,860
That's wonderful.

110
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,220
Come on. Let's go to Banyuepan.

111
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,740
Listen carefully.

112
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,060
Don't you come here again.

113
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,020
(Divorce Agreement)

114
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,500
Madam.

115
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,340
His Lordship divorced Luo Shiyi.

116
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,660
Finally.

117
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,220
This day finally comes.

118
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,940
Zhun.

119
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,500
-Zhun, what are you doing?
-I want my mother.

120
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,100
I want my mother.

121
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,740
You are such

122
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,980
a willful kid.

123
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,140
That...

124
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,940
That bad woman will come back no more.

125
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,700
And she's no longer your mother.

126
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,500
Got it?

127
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,220
She won't...

128
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,060
She won't leave me alone.

129
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,500
She will come back.

130
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,460
You are a bad woman.

131
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,780
You...

132
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,740
Zhun,

133
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,500
I know you don't like me.

134
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,500
But I promise

135
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,820
I will do my best to take care

136
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,780
of you in the future.

137
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,540
Okay?

138
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,460
Stop.

139
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,900
Here.

140
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,580
Are you hurt?

141
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,660
Thank you for your care, My Lord.

142
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,540
I'm fine.

143
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,660
Zhun,

144
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,980
don't be rude,

145
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,980
or I'll ground you for three days.

146
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,540
Father, I miss my mother.

147
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,020
Please go and get my mother back.

148
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,700
Okay?

149
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,100
Don't mention that again.

150
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,300
She won't come back anymore.

151
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,300
Zhaoying.

152
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,820
Get a few servants later

153
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,260
to clear out

154
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,060
the room.

155
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,020
My Lord.

156
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,260
Go.

157
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,300
Yes, My Lord.

158
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,380
Mother.

159
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,260
I want my mother.

160
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,140
-I want my mother.
-Zhun.

161
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,940
Zhun.

162
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,460
-I want my mother.
-Zhun.

163
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,780
Zhun.

164
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,100
How did you get here

165
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,780
all of a sudden?

166
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,140
Take Zhun back.

167
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,860
-Yes.
-I want my mother.

168
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,740
Zhun, let's go.

169
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,060
-Mother.
-Zhun.

170
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Zhun, let's go.

171
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,140
I want my mother.

172
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,020
Let me walk you back.

173
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,260
Thank you, My Lord.

174
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,900
Great Madam,

175
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,540
Xu family is so big.

176
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,540
There are many things to take care of.

177
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,460
You need someone to
manage the household affairs.

178
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,140
The wife of the Marquis

179
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,460
shouldn't be vacant for long.

180
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,020
You watched

181
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,380
Lianfang grow up.

182
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,140
As the legitimate daughter
of the Qiao family,

183
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,220
she's a perfect match for the Marquis.

184
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,460
Don't you think the legal wife position

185
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,100
should be...

186
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,180
I understand what you are saying.

187
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,660
It is a little unfair

188
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,380
for Lianfang to be a concubine.

189
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,100
But legitimizing a concubine

190
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,020
is against the rules.

191
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,100
People will criticize us

192
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,300
if they find out.

193
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,260
Great Madam.

194
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,540
I...

195
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,940
But

196
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,620
we can find a way around it.

197
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,100
As soon

198
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,380
as Lianfang is pregnant,

199
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,580
the two families can go to the Palace

200
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,700
and ask His Majesty
to grant her this favor.

201
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,940
That'll make things different.

202
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,100
But we have to be patient about this.

203
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
That's right.

204
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,300
You are so right.

205
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,180
Absolutely.

206
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,100
We need to be

207
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,420
patient about this.

208
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,060
Great Madam,

209
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,420
after talking to you

210
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,580
about this thing,

211
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,980
I feel so

212
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,020
relieved now.

213
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,860
Good. Good.

214
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,060
Have some tea.

215
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,900
Great Madam really said so?

216
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,180
(Elegant and Fine Lady)
It's all truth.

217
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,060
When did I ever lie to you?

218
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,180
That's great.

219
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,860
As long as I'm pregnant,

220
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,060
my dream will come true.

221
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,300
But,

222
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,260
we need to be patient about this

223
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,140
and plan it for the long term.

224
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,380
Mother,

225
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,860
no worries.

226
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,580
I understand.

227
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,180
I can wait.

228
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,500
Lately, His Lordship

229
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,780
doesn't treat me as coldly as before

230
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,980
anymore.

231
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,380
That day,

232
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,540
he even walked me back

233
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,260
worrying if I got hurt.

234
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,900
I just knew it.

235
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,060
There's no way that the Marquis

236
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,300
won't be interested in my daughter.

237
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,780
Turns out that Luo Shiyi

238
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,420
was indeed my biggest stumbling block.

239
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,780
Now that she's gone,

240
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,020
His Lordship treats me so differently.

241
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,620
My happy days have finally arrived.

242
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,420
(Elegant and Fine Lady)
Then you should seize the opportunity

243
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,300
and get pregnant as soon as possible.

244
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,820
Mother, don't worry.

245
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,980
Since His Lordship cares about me now,

246
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,580
getting pregnant

247
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,300
will only be a matter of time.

248
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,980
Before long,

249
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,380
I will become Marquis Yongping's wife.

250
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,340
But

251
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,420
I found

252
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,420
that the Luo family has been

253
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,420
looking for

254
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,020
Mingjing's whereabouts recently.

255
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,860
It must be because Luo Shiyi
doesn't want to give up.

256
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,860
She wants to find Mingjing
to prove her innocence.

257
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,100
Mother,

258
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,180
have you made the arrangement?

259
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,260
Mingjing has

260
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,020
left the capital.

261
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,540
There shouldn't be any problem.

262
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,340
Mother, I'm still worried.

263
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,380
I think

264
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,820
you should send someone
to confirm again.

265
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,580
Better yet,

266
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,580
don't let him

267
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,860
come back ever.

268
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,740
Alright.

269
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,620
I'll send someone to confirm again.

270
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,820
I'll also

271
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,060
ask a few people to
keep an eye on the Luo family.

272
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,260
If there's anything wrong,

273
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,860
we can handle it in time.

274
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,340
Just rest assured

275
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,060
and get ready to become

276
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,900
the Marquis's wife.

277
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,620
I thought

278
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,540
His Lordship would get Her Ladyship back.

279
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,420
I didn't expect
that he'd actually divorce her.

280
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,940
Her Ladyship...

281
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,980
Wait,

282
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,820
she shouldn't be called
Her Ladyship anymore.

283
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,580
After all,

284
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,220
Shiyi

285
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,780
is just an illegitimate daughter.

286
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,300
If she were a legitimate daughter
of Luo family,

287
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
His Lordship wouldn't
divorce her this easily.

288
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,380
So,

289
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,580
what do you think

290
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,980
will happen next?

291
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,780
What next?

292
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,820
Do you think Concubine Qiao
will be legitimized?

293
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,220
I'm afraid that'll be against the rules.

294
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,540
How come?

295
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,220
Think about it.

296
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,460
She even took Shiyi down.

297
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,580
There's nothing

298
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,740
that she isn't capable of doing.

299
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,700
You mean

300
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,420
Her Ladyship left because of her?

301
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,340
Are you stupid or what?

302
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,100
Didn't you see that?

303
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,980
Concubine Qiao has always tried

304
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,780
to set Shiyi up.

305
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,980
Look at her.

306
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,060
In terms of Shiyi's

307
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,580
fake pregnancy,

308
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,420
she slandered her.

309
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,700
She cried so hard

310
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,940
and threatened with her life.

311
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,100
In the end, she forced Great Madam

312
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,660
to get rid of Shiyi.

313
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,860
But, come to think of it,

314
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,660
Shiyi didn't blame

315
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,500
Concubine Qiao for no reason.

316
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,460
Qiao family and Xu family

317
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,740
are very close to each other.

318
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,100
Plus, Great Madam

319
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,020
favors Concubine Qiao a lot.

320
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,660
Normally,

321
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,300
when late Her Ladyship passed away,

322
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,580
Concubine Qiao should've

323
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,900
replaced her.

324
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,020
Do you think in the future she will...

325
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,820
I...

326
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,860
If you talk nonsense again,

327
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,540
I'll kick you out.

328
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,460
-How dare you slap me?
-Don't. Don't.

329
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:36,820
Don't.

330
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,380
We are of equal status.

331
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,380
And I married into
the Xu family earlier than you.

332
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,500
You should call me sister.

333
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,300
How dare you kick me out?

334
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,700
You don't believe me?

335
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,460
Then let's wait and see.

336
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,660
Why are you hiding?

337
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,380
Actually, I should thank you

338
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,460
for making my life better.

339
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,380
What did she mean?

340
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,220
Why would she thank you?

341
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,420
I don't know.

342
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,620
(It won't take long)

343
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,340
(before I become your legal wife.)

344
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,540
(I'll read poem)

345
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,340
(and dine with you.)

346
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,460
(I'll give birth to your children)

347
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,500
(and spend the rest
of my life with you.)

348
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,020
(I'll be the only one in your eyes,)

349
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,540
(and I'll be the only one)

350
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,780
(you love.)

351
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,300
My Lord,

352
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,100
I think you should get Her Ladyship back.

353
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,020
Even though Her Ladyship made a mistake,

354
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,980
you've never smiled again

355
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,140
ever since she left.

356
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,260
(Residence of Luo )

357
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,020
Madam,

358
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,860
your mother sent a letter to you.

359
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,140
Madam,

360
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,860
what's wrong?

361
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,460
Mingjing is missing.

362
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,260
Last night,

363
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,780
the people my mother sent

364
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,500
saw a carriage of the Luo family

365
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,260
leave the capital secretly.

366
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,300
Unfortunately, they lost sight
of the carriage on the way.

367
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,460
That should be

368
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,380
the carriage for picking up Mingjing.

369
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,900
Then what should we do, Madam?

370
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,700
Go and tell my mother

371
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,940
that what matters the most

372
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
right now is to find Mingjing

373
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,220
as soon as possible.

374
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,540
Yes.

375
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,980
Mother,

376
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,740
Shiyi is still young.

377
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,180
If you insist on kicking her out,

378
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,100
the rest of her life

379
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,540
will be ruined.

380
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,300
All you can think about is your sister.

381
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,380
Have you ever thought about Zhun?

382
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,580
The Divorce Agreement

383
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,220
ended years of in-law relationship

384
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,180
between our family and the Xu family.

385
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,620
On whom can Zhun

386
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,220
rely now in the Xu family?

387
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,220
Yes.

388
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,180
I understand your concern, Mother.

389
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,820
Out of sight and out of mind.

390
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,420
If you don't want to see her,

391
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,300
you can send her

392
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,220
to the suburb villa.

393
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,060
Maybe things can still turn around.

394
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,980
Fine.

395
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,100
Just send her there.

396
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,420
As long as

397
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
I don't have to see her again.

398
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,300
First, a carriage
left the capital secretly.

399
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,500
And now, Luo Shiyi

400
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,460
went to the suburb villa.

401
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,980
No matter what,

402
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,860
this thing feels quite suspicious.

403
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,020
It's highly possible that Mingjing

404
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,820
is hiding in the suburb villa.

405
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,860
Then why wouldn't Luo Shiyi

406
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,540
let him testify for her,

407
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,620
but hide him instead?

408
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,620
Mingjing wouldn't tell the truth

409
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,540
easily.

410
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,140
Otherwise,

411
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,140
he'd get himself involved, too.

412
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,540
Xiuyuan,

413
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
we'll go to the villa

414
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,020
at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.

415
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,140
If Mingjing

416
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,900
is really hiding there...

417
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,740
My mother is too soft-hearted.

418
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
She let him live.

419
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,220
The villa is located in a remote place.

420
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,540
It won't be too hard

421
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,060
to kill him.

422
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,380
It's really Mingjing.

423
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,820
Kill him.

424
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,740
Do it.

425
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:14,980
Come on.

426
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,620
Qiao Lianfang.

427
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,180
What are you doing?

428
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,540
Shiyi,

429
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,860
I wasn't going to kill you.

430
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,060
But since you are looking for death,

431
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,980
I'll satisfy you.

432
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,940
You tried so hard

433
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,660
to get here to kill Mingjing,

434
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,540
which means it is you
who murdered Yuanniang.

435
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,980
You are right.

436
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,500
I asked Mingjing

437
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,980
to tamper with Yuanniang's medication.

438
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,700
I am the one who murdered Yuanniang.

439
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,260
So what, if you know?

440
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,780
How can you talk when you are dead?

441
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,660
Your Ladyship.

442
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,700
My... My Lord.

443
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,340
How...

444
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,700
How come you are here?

445
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,060
If you want to kill Mingjing,

446
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,860
I'm afraid you got the wrong person.

447
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,260
Madam,

448
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,780
I'm sorry.

449
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,380
Linbo?

450
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,540
I cared about you

451
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,700
and trusted you so much.

452
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,380
Even when you made mistakes,

453
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,660
I'd still give you a chance.

454
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,540
I can't believe

455
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,580
that all your kindness

456
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,220
was just an act.

457
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,300
Yuanniang

458
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,100
was actually killed by you.

459
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,460
And you didn't stop there.

460
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,860
You even wanted to
kill Mingjing to cover your sin

461
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,740
so that you could frame Shiyi.

462
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
You lured me into your trap.

463
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,140
When did you start

464
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,740
to set the trap for me?

465
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,580
Ever since the accident happened
in Xianling Pavilion

466
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,860
and Mingjing went missing,

467
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,740
I've sensed

468
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,140
that you'd raised your guard.

469
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,940
But I didn't have any evidence,

470
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,300
so I had to trick you

471
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,780
into making a confession.

472
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,580
That's why I pretended to confess

473
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,460
and put myself
in the worst possible situation,

474
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,100
so that you will

475
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,620
let your guard down

476
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,620
and think that your plan worked.

477
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,340
My Lord,

478
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,860
back then, all the evidence

479
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
was against her.

480
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,940
Why were you still willing to trust her?

481
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,540
Because I knew
what kind of person Shiyi is.

482
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,820
There must be something wrong.

483
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,860
So I visited Luo family

484
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,700
and talked to Shiyi

485
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,740
right after I got the news.

486
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,340
My Lord, you are really
willing to trust me?

487
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,500
I've led the army for years.

488
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,740
I think I'm quite good at
discern people's nature.

489
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,820
I can tell who's wrong and who's right.

490
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,860
You are my wife.

491
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,460
I know what kind of person you are.

492
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,660
Even if everybody doubts you,

493
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,460
I'll still trust you.

494
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
Thank you, My Lord.

495
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,100
My Lord,

496
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,580
Mingjing is missing.

497
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,060
The only way of making

498
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,220
Qiao Lianfang admit her guilt

499
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,020
is to disrupt her plan

500
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,300
and have her confess herself.

501
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,740
But,

502
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,460
I need your help to make that happen.

503
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,940
If I'm right,

504
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,140
I think Qiao Lianfang has also

505
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
bribed someone
in Luo family into helping her.

506
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,780
My Lord, would you like to
put on a show with me?

507
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,780
We had a fight in the Residence of Luo

508
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,420
to let you believe

509
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,180
that His Lordship and I were over.

510
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,340
When the time came, he'd issue me

511
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,100
a Divorce Agreement.

512
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,780
And we didn't expect

513
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,620
that the time would come so quickly.

514
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,340
Madam Qiao maliciously
spread the rumor

515
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,260
and tried to worsen the situation.

516
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,180
It actually offered me

517
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,940
(Divorce Agreement)
a chance to issue the Divorce Agreement.

518
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,420
So

519
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,940
the Divorce Agreement was fake?

520
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,260
(Divorce Agreement)

521
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,620
I'll let them spread the news

522
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,060
that Mingjing has been found
by the Luo family.

523
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,980
And next,

524
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,340
just ask Shiyi to go to the villa.

525
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,780
Alright.

526
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,540
I'll figure out a way.

527
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,380
I first sent a carriage
to leave the capital,

528
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,860
and then I left for the villa myself,

529
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,700
in order to have you believe

530
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,780
that I was hiding Mingjing

531
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,500
in the suburb villa.

532
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,260
The moment you saw Mingjing,

533
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,900
you ordered to kill him,

534
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,260
making the truth revealed.

535
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,820
In order to deal with me,

536
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,020
you planned everything so carefully.

537
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,380
My Lord,

538
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,700
I also married you.

539
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,220
But for her,

540
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,420
you deliberately deceived me.

541
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,260
That is so unfair.

542
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,340
You first murdered Yuanniang,

543
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,060
then repeatedly framed Shiyi

544
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,660
and lied to me and Mother.

545
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,140
Does that sound fair to you?

546
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:25,860
I...

547
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,980
You are actually blaming Lingyi?

548
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,540
Kid,

549
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,820
it's all your fault.

550
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,220
Great Madam,

551
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,540
I know it's my fault.

552
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,940
I know it.

553
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,260
But she...

554
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,460
Hasn't she done anything wrong?

555
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,340
Great Madam,

556
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,180
don't forget

557
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,900
that it's Luo Shiyi
who bullied the refugees

558
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,180
and ruined the good name of Xu family.

559
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,860
You personally saw that,

560
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,420
Great Madam.

561
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,940
At this point,

562
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,940
you are still trying to shift the blame.

563
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,620
Linbo,

564
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,340
bring her in.

565
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,140
Who asked you to turn
the embroidery girls

566
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,660
against Shiyi and defame the Xu family?

567
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,860
It's...

568
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,540
It's Madam Qiao.

569
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,540
She gave me 100 tael of silver

570
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,900
and asked me to abet the refugees

571
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,340
and stir up trouble.

572
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,940
Besides,

573
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,140
it's also Madam Qiao
who arranged those people

574
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,660
to buy the embroidery at a high price,

575
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,500
so as to

576
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,060
destroy the reputation

577
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,980
of Xu family

578
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,620
and let Madam Xu take the blame.

579
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,980
In that case, Madam Xu would never

580
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,340
be able to come back.

581
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,940
Turns out...

582
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,420
Turns out you were

583
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,540
behind the whole thing.

584
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,420
For your own benefit,

585
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,900
you'd rather ruin our Xu family.

586
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,300
But you are also one of us.

587
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,180
Bring her in.

588
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,580
Confess.

589
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,540
When I was in charge of
the Xishan Villa,

590
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,860
Concubine Qiao gave me money

591
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,300
and asked me

592
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
to lure away

593
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,700
Her Ladyship's guards

594
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,260
in order to find a chance
to kidnap her.

595
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,660
And,

596
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,740
the dog that made Zhun sick.

597
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,820
It would get everybody
who has a close contact with it sick.

598
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,580
It's also...

599
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,420
It's also Concubine Qiao

600
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,860
who asked me to bring it here.

601
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,900
So...

602
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,700
So you are responsible for
all those things.

603
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,660
You are simply out of control.

604
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,540
That's right.

605
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,660
It's all me.

606
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,980
I did all those things.

607
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,580
My Lord.

608
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,540
Great Madam.

609
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,540
How shall we punish Concubine Qiao?

610
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,380
Please advise.

611
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Lingyi,

612
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,460
it's up to you.

613
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,180
Qiao Lianfang poisoned Yuanniang

614
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,580
and caused her miscarriage and death.

615
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,580
She also repeatedly framed Shiyi.

616
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,060
She is gravely sinful

617
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,580
and completely unforgivable.

618
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
According to our family rules,

619
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,260
she'll be flogged 30 times

620
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,220
and then sent to the village

621
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,180
to be a nun with hair.

622
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,500
She'll never be allowed to
come back to the capital.

623
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,780
My Lord, this is...

624
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,340
Of course I'd put some effort

625
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,940
to welcome you back.

626
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,260
What do you think?

627
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,100
My Lord, you are so thoughtful.

628
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,620
I didn't know until today that

629
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,940
you've been keeping it a secret for me

630
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,700
about me teaching in Xianling Pavilion.

631
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,060
Don't you mind it?

632
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,820
In the beginning, I also thought

633
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,820
that women shouldn't
show themselves in public.

634
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,620
But

635
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,060
when I personally saw you

636
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,700
teach the refugees embroidery,

637
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,100
I knew that you sincerely wanted

638
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,260
to help them.

639
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,100
I shouldn't stop you from doing that.

640
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,060
My Lord,

641
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,340
I want to discuss something with you.

642
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,500
Because of me, Xianling Pavilion

643
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,820
suffered a big loss.

644
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
I want to pay Master Jian

645
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,460
compensation for the damage.

646
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,180
You decide.

647
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,740
If you don't have enough money,

648
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,820
you can go to Steward Bai.

649
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,060
My Lord, why are you so nice to me?

650
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,020
Because when you are happy,

651
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,020
I am happy, too.

652
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

653
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,700
General Fu sent a message,

654
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,820
saying that Concubine Qiao
wants to see His Lordship,

655
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,420
and she wouldn't stop crying.

656
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,580
I guess she has something to say to you.

657
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,780
Tell her

658
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,140
His Lordship will be there soon.

659
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,540
My Lord,

660
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,500
do you still remember

661
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,660
that when I was ten,

662
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,380
my mother brought me to Xu family,

663
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,740
and I saw you play zither in the yard.

664
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,260
By accident, I fell down.

665
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,980
To cheer me up,

666
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,860
you folded a big bunch of
peach blossoms for me.

667
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,500
I was looking at you

668
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,420
and thinking

669
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,460
you are so handsome.

670
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,140
When I grow up,

671
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,980
I must marry you.

672
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
From then on,

673
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,380
no one else could walk into my heart.

674
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,780
You like playing zither,

675
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,660
so I learned it from
all the famous teachers

676
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,060
and practiced very hard.

677
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,940
When you went into battles,

678
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,980
I was worried sick

679
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,100
and couldn't sleep every day.

680
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,220
That's how I loved you

681
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,820
for over ten years.

682
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,260
If this is why you asked to see me,

683
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,540
you can stop now.

684
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,100
My Lord,

685
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,900
it's true that I murdered Yuanniang.

686
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,660
But Luo Yuanniang

687
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
wasn't a good person anyway.

688
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,140
If it hadn't been for her,

689
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,620
how could I, a legitimate daughter

690
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,180
of the Qiao family, have ended up like this

691
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,220
and become a concubine?

692
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,820
Yes, I made mistakes.

693
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,140
But Luo Yuanniang and Shiyi

694
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,660
colluded in setting me up.

695
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,500
Haven't they done anything wrong?

696
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,980
My Lord, why

697
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,340
do you blame me only?

698
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
Hadn't you trespassed on
the inner garden,

699
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,940
Yuanniang's plan wouldn't have worked.

700
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,980
You claim yourself
as a legitimate daughter,

701
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,860
yet you don't even have the concept

702
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,980
of avoiding arousing suspicion?

703
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,380
Besides,

704
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,460
that was done by Yuanniang.

705
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,460
Shiyi had nothing to do with it.

706
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,500
In fact, Shiyi has never

707
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,020
given you a hard time.

708
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,940
But you framed her

709
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
over and over again.

710
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,540
You are such an evil woman.

711
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,180
But I did that for you.

712
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,380
Luo Yuanniang
didn't understand you at all.

713
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,820
And Luo Shiyi is lowborn.

714
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,620
She doesn't deserve to be your wife.

715
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,900
I'm the only one...

716
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,540
I'm the only one who deserves

717
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,740
to be your wife.

718
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,940
For you,

719
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,740
I can forget about

720
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,780
my pride and dignity.

721
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,340
I've done so much for you.

722
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,060
Why do you

723
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,900
still not understand my heart?

724
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,260
I've loved you for over ten years.

725
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,780
Why can't you

726
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,380
accept me?

727
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,620
I'm the one who loves you

728
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,980
the most in this world.

729
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,260
Love is about mutual appreciation,

730
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
respect,

731
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,380
trust,

732
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,820
and compromise.

733
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,940
It cannot be forced,

734
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,940
or obtained by humbling yourself.

735
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,380
Even though you are
a legitimate daughter,

736
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,020
your evil intentions have made

737
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,940
you a heartless person.

738
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,260
Shiyi may be an illegitimate daughter,

739
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,220
but she gained our respect through her

740
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,580
kindness and good heart.

741
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,180
It means

742
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,180
the value of a person

743
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,020
doesn't depend on status,

744
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,260
but nature.

745
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,500
For all this time,

746
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,060
you've never

747
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,020
had any feelings for me?

748
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,700
Mother, I faked my pregnancy

749
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,260
and lied to you.

750
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,820
I also taught the refugees embroidery

751
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,780
in Xianling Pavilion behind your back,

752
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,300
almost ruining
the good name of Xu family.

753
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,220
I'd like to accept punishment.

754
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,020
You did those things for a reason.

755
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,940
I can't blame you.

756
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,300
It's my fault

757
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,460
that I backed up the wrong person

758
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,860
and made you

759
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,820
suffer so much for no reason.

760
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,340
Lingyi,

761
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
help Shiyi rise.

762
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,300
Here.

763
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,100
Thank you, Mother.

764
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,420
Please rise.

765
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,500
Mrs. Du.

766
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,980
This ruby head-ornament

767
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,660
is my dowry.

768
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,580
Take it.

769
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,180
Hope it'll help to calm your nerves.

770
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,220
Mother,

771
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,500
this is too valuable.

772
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,740
I can't take it.

773
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,620
It's a great gesture from Mother.

774
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,620
Just take it.

775
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,740
Thank you so much, Mother.

776
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,380
Lingyi has told me

777
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,140
what happened.

778
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,700
He knew everything,

779
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,020
but he didn't tell me

780
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,780
in case I'd get worried.

781
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,740
But, Shiyi,

782
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,020
you are the Marquis's wife.

783
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,780
It's inappropriate for you

784
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,740
to show yourself in public like that.

785
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,340
I hope you can stay away

786
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,100
from Xianling Pavilion from now on.

787
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,260
You should stay at home
being a good wife and mother.

788
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,220
That's what women

789
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,500
are supposed to do.

790
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,660
-Mo...
-Mother.

791
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,900
Shiyi's good deed of teaching

792
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,900
refugees embroidery in Xianling Pavilion

793
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,260
has won wide praise in the Palace.

794
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,860
Imperial consorts and concubines
are all impressed

795
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,860
by her kindness.

796
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,740
If Shiyi leaves

797
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,660
now,

798
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,180
they may think

799
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,020
that we

800
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,700
did it only for fame

801
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,860
when they find out.

802
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,820
In that case,

803
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,660
you can

804
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,380
keep doing it for now.

805
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,860
But I need you

806
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,740
to promise me one thing.

807
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,540
You must not

808
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,860
make a profit for yourself

809
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,260
by using Lingyi's power.

810
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
And you must not

811
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,580
take advantage of the people

812
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,060
and harm the reputation
of the Xu family.

813
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,700
Can you promise?

814
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,100
Mother, rest assured.

815
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,540
I promise

816
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,620
that I will not use

817
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,500
His Lordship's power

818
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,700
to make a profit for myself,

819
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,820
and I will not

820
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,580
do anything that'll harm our Xu family.

821
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,500
Good.

822
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,500
Father-in-law, please accept my apology.

823
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,140
Our Xu family misunderstood Shiyi.

824
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,300
Shiyi was wronged for no reason.

825
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,100
I did what I had to do on that day.

826
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,460
So I brought you gifts today
to apologize to you.

827
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,540
Father, I was too thoughtless.

828
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,700
Sorry that I made you, Mother,

829
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,740
Zhenxing and my sister-in-law worried.

830
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,620
My Lord, never mind.

831
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,260
It's all because you and Shiyi

832
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,260
understand

833
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,300
and trust each other,

834
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,500
that Qiao Lianfang finally...

835
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,660
When Yuanniang was pregnant,

836
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,380
Qiao Lianfang

837
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,700
poisoned

838
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
her medication

839
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,100
and caused her death.

840
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,980
I failed in protecting her.

841
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,940
I'm willing to
accept your punishment.

842
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,540
Yuanniang

843
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,180
was murdered by Qiao Lianfang?

844
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,140
That's true.

845
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,900
The Marquis said so himself.

846
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,420
Yuanniang

847
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:18,660
was murdered?

848
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,460
What an awful sin.

849
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,740
I've been cunning for all my life,

850
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,260
but I've never thought

851
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,900
that my precious daughter

852
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,100
would be murdered

853
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,940
by another scheming person.

854
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,940
Is it karma?

855
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,100
Your Ladyship. Are you alright?

856
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,020
Your Ladyship.

857
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,700
Your Ladyship. Are you okay?

858
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,140
Maybe

859
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,260
she has a stroke.

860
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,180
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

861
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,860
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

862
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,780
Great Madam,

863
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,100
you watched Lianfang grow up.

864
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,660
You know her better

865
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,780
than anybody else does.

866
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:24,860
She...

867
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,220
She was just confused.

868
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,620
Please give her another chance.

869
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,340
Please let her stay in Xu family.

870
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,780
She can be a concubine or a slave,

871
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,740
as long as you let her stay by your side

872
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,820
and serve you and the Marquis,

873
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,140
so that she can atone for her sin.

874
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,060
I'm begging you. Great Madam.

875
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,300
If I give her another chance,

876
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,180
what about Yuanniang?

877
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,860
What about my grandchild?

878
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,140
Who would give them another chance?

879
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,860
If she doesn't want to be a nun,

880
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,620
then she'll be sent to
Shuntian Prefecture Office.

881
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,900
It's your choice.

882
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,180
Great Madam.

883
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,420
This is...

884
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,740
Lianfang.

885
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,060
Mother.

886
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,460
Lianfang.

887
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,700
This is not a place for humans to live.

888
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,540
Come on.

889
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,660
Let me get you out of here.

890
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,540
Let's go.

891
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,500
If the Xu family go to

892
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,140
Shuntian Prefecture Office and sue us,

893
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,740
we'll find a few people

894
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,220
to take the blame.

895
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,220
Let's go.

896
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,340
Mother.

897
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,940
Please just let me stay.

898
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,980
Lianfang.

899
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,220
What's...

900
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,820
What's wrong with you?

901
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,060
Don't scare me.

902
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,580
Lianfang.

903
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,660
Mother,

904
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,020
I've striven for

905
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,260
the things

906
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,460
I wanted.

907
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,100
And now,

908
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,260
I've found peace

909
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,340
and I want no more.

910
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,940
It's my fault.

911
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,460
I've been teaching you

912
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,820
how to be scheming
since you were little.

913
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,540
I'd do whatever

914
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,060
it takes to get what you wanted.

915
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,540
But I forgot to tell you

916
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,100
that some obsession

917
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,980
can be dangerous.

918
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,540
I thought I could

919
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,060
protect you for a lifetime in that way.

920
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,460
But I didn't expect...

921
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,260
It's my fault.

922
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,860
It's all my fault.

923
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,940
Lianfang.

924
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,780
Mother.

925
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,540
At this point,

926
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,940
I won't blame anybody.

927
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,580
You've got to take good care

928
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,300
of yourself.

929
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,220
I'm your only daughter.

930
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,020
And now,

931
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,460
I can no longer care for you.

932
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,980
Your life will be

933
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,700
even harder in the future.

934
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,340
Lianfang.

935
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,780
Lianfang.

936
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,460
Lianfang.
