You good-for-nothings!

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,480
So many people have been mobilized,

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,840
but you still failed to find Xu Lingyi.

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
What's the point of hiring you?

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,840
My Lord, please cool off.

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,640
As you ordered,

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,120
we'd rather kill anyone who's suspicious

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,560
than let a single one escape.

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,400
Therefore,

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,680
many innocent common people
were mistakenly killed.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
But even so,

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,400
we still haven't got any clues

31
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,680
about Xu Lingyi's whereabouts.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm really wondering

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,240
how on earth he avoided

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
our rigorous search.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,840
It's time for the execution.

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,520
Come out.

37
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,820
(Mansion of Xu)

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,720
Great Madam Xu,

39
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,840
nobody is allowed

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,520
to leave the Mansion of Xu

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,800
without permission.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,880
My family

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,880
is going to be executed

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
as a victim of a false charge.

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,440
If you don't let me out,

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,640
I prefer to kill myself here.

-Mother!
-Mother!

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,080
After getting changed,

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,760
you go and guard the ways

50
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,220
which must be passed
if he wants to enter the Palace.

51
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Make sure you stop Xu Lingyi doing that.

52
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,480
Take off your mask

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
so that Official Yan can see your face.

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,680
Go.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,070
Go.

57
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,760
Go.

58

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,280

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
-Yes, sir!
-Yes.

63
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,080
What do you mean
by doing this, Duke Wei?

64
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,560
We're under orders

65
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
to assist Censorate
in arresting the convict.

66
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Duke Wei,

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
please hand him over.

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Who are you

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
to say that he's a convict?

70
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
I'm telling you.

71
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,400
He's a nobody

72
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,280
who has run away from my military camp.

73
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm going to take him back.

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,760
To decide if he's a convict,

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,480
we just need to take off his mask

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
to have a look at his face.

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,160
Guards!

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,200
How dare you?

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
Who do you think you are?

80
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,200
How dare you run wild
in the presence of me?

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
Even if the Imperial Censor

82
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,240
is here right now,

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,360
I'll take him away!

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,920
Take him away!

85
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,240
Send guys to lie in ambush
around the Imperial Palace.

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,560
No matter how bold Ren Kun is,

87
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,640
he dares not

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,800
take Xu Lingyi to the Imperial Palace.

89
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,720
We have to say goodbye here.

90
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
As for the rest,

91
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,440
you have to depend on yourself.

92
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
Duke Wei, how did you know

93
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,440
I would show up there?

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
Luo Zhenxing came to me.

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,800
He said your wife thought

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,400
you would come into town

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,400
disguising as a killer
working for Marquis Jingyuan.

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,480
So I sent some guys

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,840
to watch over their turf.

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,800
You should hurry.

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Your wife is going to

102
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
be executed soon.

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,400
Duke Wei, thank you for your help.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,760
Go ahead.

105
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,840
Isn't that Marquis Yongping's wife?

106
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,640
Yeah.

107
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,920
What has happened?

108
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,520

What happened?

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,240
Stop there!

120
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,280
Go.

121
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,360

-God!
-No way.

127
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
I even got disaster relief
from her after the disaster.

She's a kind person.

129

This way.

136
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,760
Notify them.

137

Hurry.

138
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,640

my father

147
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,360

see you in another life.

158
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,960
Time is up.

159
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,200
Hold on!

161

Shiyi is wronged.

You can't kill her.

Shiyi.

167
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,440
It's a heavy offense to enter
the execution ground without permission.

168
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
You must've suffered a lot.

169

Considering the contributions

170
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,280
the Xu family made to the country,

171
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,640
I'll let you off.

172

Get out of here now.

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,280
Don't try to stop the execution.

174
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
Shiyi

175
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
is my daughter-in-law.

176
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,280
She's the victim of a false charge.

177
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
I won't give up on her

178
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,400
even if I have to

179
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,760
put the Xu family at risk.

180
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,880
What are you waiting for?

181
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,360
Get them out of here.

182
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,400
You want to

183
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
kill Shiyi today?

184
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Over my dead body!

185
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Shiyi, don't worry.

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,600
His Lordship is sure
to come and save you.

187
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,280
You'll be fine.

188
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,440
When villains are in power,

189
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
the faithful and upright
suffer persecution.

190
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,840
Where is the justice?

191
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,280
What's the point of

192
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
being a faithful and upright official?

193
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,840
If you kill

194
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,760
Shiyi today,

195
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,840
aren't you afraid you'll be infamous

196
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,520
for persecuting good and honest people?

197
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,800
Time is up.

198
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,880
Drive them away.

199
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,400
Don't you dare...

200
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,480
-Go away.
-You can't kill her.

201
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Go away.

202
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
You can't kill her.

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,800
Madam Xu is a good person.

204
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,320
Shiyi.

205
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,720
Hurry.

206
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,240
You're a good girl.

207
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,120
Mother!

208
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Hang on.

209
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,960
Lingyi will come and save you.

210
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,600
Get out of here.

211
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,720
You can't kill her.

212
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,840
Thank you

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,280
for what you did, Mother!

214
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,920
You can't behead her!

215
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,840
You can't behead her!

216
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
You can't behead her!

217
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,160
You can't behead her!

218
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,480
You can't behead her!

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,120
You can't behead her!

220
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,220
(Honest and Just)

221
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,720
Mother!

222
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,420
(Mansion of Xu)

223
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,400
Great Madam,

224
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,400
what to do with Her Ladyship's stuff?

225
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,320
Burn them away.

226
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,560
Yes, Great Madam.

227
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,640
My Lord, is Her Ladyship
still unconscious?

228
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
Your Ladyship, you're awake!

229
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,840
My Lord!

230
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,160
My Lord.

231
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,120
You're awake.

232
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,160
Your Ladyship,

233
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,800
I'm going to

234
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,040
get some food for you.

235
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,480
My Lord.

236
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Why am I...

237
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,080
It's alright now.

238
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,400
The death penalty has been remitted

239
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,520
by His Majesty.

240
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,400
What happened?

241
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,120
I've presented the evidence

242
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,280
to His Majesty.

243
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
Soon enough,

244
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,640
the truth will come out.

245
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,320
My Lord,

246
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,120
you must've suffered a lot.

247
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,920
Mother told me

248
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
you looked undaunted

249
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,640
even if you were going to be beheaded.

250
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,120
At that time,
everything went black suddenly

251
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,000
and I can't remember anything.

252
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,840
I was not as brave as Mother thought.

253
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,280
It's not that you're not brave enough.

254
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,800
It's just...

255
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400

(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)

272
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
Marquis Jingyuan,

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,880
come with us.

274
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,080
I just

275
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,310
lost the game.

276
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,820
(Beloved Husband Ou Lixing's Tablet)

277
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,460
(Prisoner)

278
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,280
Mr. Ou.

279
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,560
Now that you've been out of prison,

280
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,240
you shouldn't have come in again.

281
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
If you hadn't helped us many times,

282
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,760
the Xu family and I
couldn't have escaped our doom.

283
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,960
I was to say thank you,

284
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,000
but compared to what you did for us,

285
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
a verbal thank-you

286
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,840
is far from enough.

287
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,600
Actually, I'm not as good as you think.

288
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,320
I've got the evidence that

289
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
my father colluded with
Wang Jiubao for long.

290
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,880
But I chose to abandon you

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,080
to save the Ou family from damage.

292
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
I'm the one who pushed you
to the execution ground.

293
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,760
Understood?

294
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,600
In that case,

295
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,800
why did you help my husband later?

296
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,080
You knew well

297
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,840
that the evidence he collected

298
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,440
would deal a death blow
to the Ou family.

299
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,280
When I got to know

300
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,640
my father even killed
innocent common people

301
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,240
to hunt down Marquis Yongping...

302
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,720
You good-for-nothings!

303
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,640
So many people have been mobilized,

304
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,040
but you still failed to find Xu Lingyi.

305
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,640
What's the point of hiring you?

306
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,840
My Lord, please cool off.

307
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,640
As you ordered,

308
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,000
we'd rather kill anyone who's suspicious

309
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
than let a single one escape.

310
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,080
Therefore,

311
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,360
many innocent common people
were mistakenly killed.

312
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,320
But even so,

313
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,120
we still haven't got any clues

314
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,480
about Xu Lingyi's whereabouts.

315
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
Family members are important,

316
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,920
but without
the sense of right and wrong,

317
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,240
we can't even be called humans.

318
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,240
I just can't watch my father

319
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,640
repeat his mistakes and do nothing.

320
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,680
We all know that

321
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,800
you never got involved in

322
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,080
any crime Marquis Jingyuan
had committed.

323
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,000
You're innocent.

324
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,840
My husband will report it
to His Majesty.

325
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,360
I believe before long

326
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,640
you'll be discharged.

327
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,360
Don't bother.

328
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,280
I deserve such punishment.

329
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,320
Mr. Ou.

330
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,680
I used to think,

331
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,240
having similar life experience,

332
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,440
similar tastes and hobbies to yours,

333
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,280
I'd be the right one for you

334
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,800
instead of Xu Lingyi

335
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,040
if it weren't for fate.

336
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,400
But now I know I was wrong.

337
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,560
Life is full of twists and turns

338
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,080
when you two are together,

339
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,600
but it has never stopped him from

340
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,120
caring for and loving you.

341
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,480
He even planned to save you

342
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,960
at the cost of his career

343
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,000
and his own life.

344
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm already no match for him

345
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,480
in terms of persistence and firmness.

346
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,680
I'm sincerely convinced.

347
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,440
Shiyi,

348
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
I wish you happiness.

349
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,320
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

350
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,440
(Ignoring the existing laws
and regulations,)

351
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,400
(Marquis Jingyuan colluded
with coastal pirates)

352
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,840
(and conspired against the government.)

353
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,160
(He posed a major threat
to national security.)

354
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,480
(He's been stripped of his title)

355
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,080
(and will be beheaded by law.)

356
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,080
(His descendants are never allowed
to become an official.)

357
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,840
(His second son Ou Yanxing)

358
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,920
(is excluded from the death penalty)

359
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,480
(because of exposing crimes)

360
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,800
(and will be exiled to the border with
the female members of the Ou family.)

361
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Father.

362
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,280
Father.

363
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,760
Can I have a talk

364
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,680
with my son?

365
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,840
Keep it short.

366
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,480
The Ou family is destroyed.

367
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,960
Are you happy now?

368
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,560
You once said

369
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,000
all you did

370
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,720
is for the sake of

371
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,840
the Ou family.

372
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,160
That's the responsibility of

373
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,400
every patriarch of the Ou family.

374
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,520
In my opinion,

375
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,280
the only mistake I made

376
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,160
is that I had unrealistic
expectations of you.

377
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,920
The journey to the border may be tough.

378
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,880
Take care.

379
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,200
Father.

380
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,600
Father.

381
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,360
Mr. Ou!

382
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,960
Mr. Ou!

383
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,120
Mr. Ou!

384
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,960
Mr. Ou!

385
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,560
Amber.

386
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,560
Please don't leave me alone.

387
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,480
I want to go with you.

388
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,800
Shiyi asked Great Madam Xu

389
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,560
to forgive you

390
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,880
and she agreed.

391
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,400
You don't have to go there with me.

392
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,800
Amber,

393
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,800
I know you're a good girl.

394
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,960
You deserve someone better.

395
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
I can't give you what you want.

396
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,880
As long as you let me

397
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,360
stay by your side,

398
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,280
I don't care about anything else.

399
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,560
But I do.

400
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,560
Now I have nothing at all.

401
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,240
I don't want you to suffer.

402
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,320
Mother!

403
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,360
Mother!

404
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,080
Yu!

405
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,600
Why are you here?

406
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,680
Mother, I miss you so much!

407
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,760
I miss you too.

408
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,080
You seem to have lost weight.

409
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,640
How did you come here?

410
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,120
Who brought you here?

411
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,520
Greetings, My Lord.

412
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,240
The truth has been revealed.

413
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,440
Concubine Qin is the informant
working for the Ou family.

414
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,480
You were just being used by her.

415
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,560
Concubine Qin?

416
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,520
Come on, Yu.

417
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
Let's go play inside.

418
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,160
Even if I was just

419
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,240
being used,

420
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,080
I did evil deeds eventually.

421
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,680
I deserve to be punished.

422
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,480
When all goes to all,

423
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,840
it's because I ignored your feelings.

424
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,000
If I had showed more concern

425
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,320
for you,

426
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,160
you might not have

427
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,520
done those things.

428
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,960
You married me,

429
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,920
but I didn't treat you well.

430
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
It's my fault.

431
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,280
But in terms of my feelings,

432
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,160
I can't force myself.

433
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,760
I've discussed it with Shiyi.

434
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
If you want to keep staying
in the Mansion of Xu,

435
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,680
I won't treat you unfairly

436
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,480
for daily necessities.

437
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,240
But if you

438
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,360
want to leave,

439
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,760
I'll also give you enough money.

440
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,560
And you have every right
to do whatever you want.

441
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,120
We won't interfere.

442
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,640
If you want to do business,

443
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
you'll also have full support

444
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,200
from Shiyi and me.

445
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,520
My Lord,

446
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
you want to abandon me?

447
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,280
That's not what I mean.

448
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm just offering you some options.

449
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,040
I've got no chance to do anything

450
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,000
for Concubine Qin or Tong,

451
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
but for you,

452
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,120
I can do something.

453
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
You're Yu's mother.

454
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,120
I hope you can live a happy life.

455
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,120
My Lord,

456
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,680
it's the first time

457
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,680
you're talking to me
in such a soft voice.

458
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,760
But as for what to do in the future,

459
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,320
I have no idea, either.

460
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,920
There's no hurry.

461
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,280
You have enough time

462
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,720
to think about it.

463
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,560
How about Yu?

464
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,720
I got a letter from Leshan

465
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,240
and they suggested
Yu go there beforehand.

466
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,080
I'll let him set off

467
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,520
in the coming days.

468
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,160
My Lord,

469
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,560
Yu is so young.

470
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,360
Now that he's going
to study in Leshan alone,

471
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,120
I can't help feeling worried.

472
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,760
Can I go along with him

473
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,920
so that I can take care of him?

474
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,200
Greetings,

475
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,840
Your Ladyship.

476
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Come on. Rise.

477
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,840
Your Ladyship,

478
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
I'm here

479
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,240
just to say goodbye.

480
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,840
You're going to stay away from home.

481
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
Take good care of yourself.

482
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,400
Come back here as soon

483
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,560
as Yu has a vacation.

484
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
We're a family.

485
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,760
I look forward to family reunion.

486
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,600
Your Ladyship,

487
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,240
I used to

488
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,200
treat you like that.

489
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,280
Don't you hate me?

490
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,720
My birth mother was a concubine too.

491
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,040
I know well

492
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,600
you have to suffer a lot

493
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,320
as a concubine.

494
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,600
Your Ladyship,
you're really broad-minded

495
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,720
and pure-hearted.

496
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,840
No wonder His Lordship

497
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,200
is deeply attached to you.

498
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,080
May you two

499
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,880
live a peaceful life together

500
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,080
till old and grey.

501
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,920
Thank you, Wen.

502
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,880
Where did you learn to drink and gamble?

503
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,080
At such a young age,

504
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,320
you've developed such bad habits.

505
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,720
What's wrong with me
drinking and gambling?

506
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,000
I heard that my father did that too

507
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,520
when he was alive.

508
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,280
Why don't you learn
from his strong points?

509
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,800
And you even dared to talk back.

510
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,840
Go

511
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,360
and copy the family rules 100 times.

512
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
There you go again.

513
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,720
I can recite the family rules already.

514
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,040
Do you want to listen?

515
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,640
Well.

516
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,920
You talked back again.

517
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm telling you.

518
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,400
I'll beat you to death today!

519
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,160
What's going on?

520
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,160
What...

521
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,440
What brought you here?

522
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,320
What's happening?

523
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,600
Why are you so polite?

524
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm here

525
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,320
just to express my gratitude to you.

526
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,280
Gratitude?

527
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,080
For what?

528
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,080
I want to thank you for seeing me

529
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,440
before I was going to be executed.

530
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,680
You saved me and His Lordship.

531
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,200
Don't thank me.

532
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,800
I didn't mean to help you.

533
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,360
I was just afraid I'd lose face

534
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,760
once the Xu family was destroyed.

535
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,800
No matter what,

536
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,880
I have to say thank you, Erniang.

537
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,160
Take a seat.

538
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,480
Chengzu made a mistake again?

539
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,160
He's so young.

540
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,800
There are many things
he doesn't understand.

541
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,720
You need to be patient with him.

542
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,920
If you always scold and punish him,

543
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,000
he'll be scared

544
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,760
and more estranged from you.

545
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
He drank and gambled

546
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,520
with those servants

547
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,480
while I was out.

548
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,240
How could I stay calm?

549
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,600
But

550
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,240
he's just a kid, after all.

551
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,200
Maybe

552
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,880
he just thinks it's much fun to do that.

553
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,520
How about

554
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,480
letting him study

555
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,920
together with Zhun

556
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,800
so that he can stay away
from those wretches?

557
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,800
In that case,

558
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,040
he's sure to make progress.

559
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,080
You're really nosy.

560
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
You're even worrying about my son.

561
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,480
Jinlian, come in

562
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,360
and get your master a cup of tea!

563
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,040
Greetings, Madam Xu.

564
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,560
Jinlian,

565
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,640
she's your real master.

566
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,400
You should address her Your Ladyship.

567
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,240
Erniang,

568
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,120
I can explain this.

569
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,760
No need.

570
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I just

571
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
didn't expect you

572
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,880
to pay so much attention to me.

573
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,040
You even tried to
persuade those around me.

574
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,040
Why?

575
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,080
Are you that afraid of me?

576
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,400
Yes.

577
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,800
I'm afraid you may be bullied.

578
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,760
I'll consider myself lucky

579
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,520
if you don't do harm to me.

580
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,440
In this case,

581
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,920
I'll leave you be.

582
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,000
See you.

583
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,630
Hold on.

584
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,670
Wait till you drink up the tea.

585
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,520
It's...

586
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,400
Madam Xu,

587
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,320
it's your favorite Queshe green tea.

588
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,760
Young Madam specially got it for you.

589
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
It's already prepared.

590
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,710
Don't forget to take it
with you when you leave.

591
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,040
It's not for free.

592
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Just take it

593
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,040
as Chengzu's tuition fees.

594
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
Why are you smiling?

595
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,040
Drink it.

596
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
It's expensive.

597
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,360
So good!

598
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,600
My Lord, you're awesome.

599
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,440
I failed to grasp the main points

600
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,000
although I'd practiced for a long time.

601
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,200
But right after you gave me some advice,

602
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,400
I've understood it completely.

603
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,440
I remember clearly

604
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
you can play the tune proficiently.

605
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,320
You did it on purpose.

606
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,040
General Fu once told me that

607
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
at a younger age,
you were gifted in many ways,

608
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,680
especially skills in playing the zither,

609
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,360
which was considered
unique in the capital.

610
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,320
But you've stopped playing it

611
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,720
since the late Marquis passed away.

612
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,160
Is that true?

613
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
After father and brother died,

614
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,240
I became the patriarch of the Xu family.

615
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,400
I have to shoulder the responsibility of

616
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,440
protecting and bringing
honor to the family.

617
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,440
How can I keep focusing
on playing the zither

618
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
and craving pleasure?

619
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,360
But I want to listen to your playing.

620
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,760
I know

621
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,440
you made that promise

622
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,680
because you felt guilty about the death

623
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,080
of your father and brother.

624
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,360
I also understand

625
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,000
how much you want to

626
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,080
be a qualified patriarch

627
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
to protect the family.

628
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,480
You chose to suppress your feelings

629
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,160
and gave up all your hobbies.

630
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,200
But My Lord,

631
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,640
by doing that,

632
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,120
you're actually punishing yourself.

633
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,080
For the sake of the Xu family,

634
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,800
you've tried so hard

635
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
and made so many efforts.

636
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,360
You've done a great job.

637
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,040
I hope

638
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
you can be happier.

639
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,720
With you by my side,

640
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,400
I'm already very happy.

641
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,160
But My Lord,

642
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,720
life is really short and unpredictable.

643
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,160
It'll be more boring

644
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,240
if you have to

645
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,840
give up your hobbies.

646
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,960
If your father and brother

647
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,000
knew about this,

648
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,960
they'd also prefer

649
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,040
you live a happier life.

650
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,720
Recently, my legs...

651
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,480
How about

652
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,760
I go out with you

653
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,920
for a walk?

654
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,120
Okay.

655
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
The melody...

656
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,640
His Lordship is playing the zither.

657
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,720
His Lordship is playing the zither.

658
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,160
I didn't expect he could even do that.

659
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,400
It's been many years

660
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,720
since I last saw Lingyi play the zither.

661
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,640
(In 1567, the Longqing Emperor
of the Ming Dynasty)

662
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,680
(lifted the sea ban.)

663
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
(The Wharf)
(He restarted foreign trade)

664
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,360
(and allowed common people
to do business)

665
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,520
(with countries in Europe
and other parts of Asia.)

666
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,960
(Since then,)

667
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
(non-governmental overseas trade)

668
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,080
(in China's south-east coastal areas)

669
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
(ushered in a new era of)

670
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,240
(all-round opening up,)

671
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,400
(known as
"Opening up in Reign of Longqing".)

672
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,800
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

673
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,520
How I wish

674
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,720
Jie could come back

675
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,960
and spend some time with us!

676
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,080
He always studies hard

677
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,720
and he's grateful.

678
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,640
He's so lovable.

679
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,760
Greetings, Great Madam Xu.

680
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,240
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

681
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,160
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

682
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,960
Great Madam Xu,

683
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,160
thank you for your invitation.

684
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,200
My husband has gone to Yunnan.

685
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,520
I thought I'd have to
spend the festival alone.

686
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,920
I'm so happy

687
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,040
to spend the day with you here.

688
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,520
You're Shiyi's sister,

689
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,120
so we're a family.

690
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,800
Make yourself at home.

691
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,280
At the Mid-Autumn Festival,

692
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,200
the whole family gather here

693
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,560
enjoying a dinner together.

694
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,040
I'm so happy!

695
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,720
Exactly.

696
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,520
Greetings, Mother.

697
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,880
You're all here.

698
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,880
I just got a letter from Yu.

699
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,520
He said he did a good job

700
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,120
and came out in front

701
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,720
in the provincial examination.

702
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,640
It seems

703
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,720
he's been studying hard

704
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,000
and has made great efforts

705
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
in the past years.

706
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,160
Yu is diligent and eager to learn.

707
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,320
He's willing

708
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,800
to put in time and energy
in his studies.

709
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,080
His success can be expected soon.

710
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
Concubine Wen is lucky

711
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
to have such a good son.

712
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,840
Hasn't Shiyi been here?

713
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,560
Yesterday, Young Madam Jiang told us

714
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,480
we should

715
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,520
have the betrothal gifts prepared

716
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,480
for Zhun's future wife in advance,

717
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,360
so Shiyi is busy with it.

718
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,120
She's gone out

719
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,720
early this morning.

720
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,280
She should've left

721
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,560
such a trivial matter to me.

722
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,320
She's already busy

723
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,760
taking care of Nuan.

724
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,880
Father.

725
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,280
Father.

726
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:52,960
You're here.

727
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,800
Grandma.

728
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,880
Father,

729
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,680
you're speaking ill of me again.

730
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,040
Mother will be angry.

731
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,280
I'd like to see what you'll do by then.

732
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,320
Nuan, you're such a good girl.

733
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,400
All I want is

734
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,320
to praise you.

735
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,760
How could I speak ill of you?

736
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,920
Do you see your brother?

737
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,200
Go play with your sister.

738
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,800
-Go ahead.
-Let's go.

739
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,920
Mother.

740
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,720
Go have fun.

741
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,680
You're all here.

742
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,400
Mother.

743
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,400
Shiyi.

744
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,400
Wuniang.

745
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,400
I've been busy.

746
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,560
I'm sorry I didn't keep you company.

747
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,720
Never mind.

748
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,280
We're a family.

749
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,640
You don't need to be so polite.

750
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,480
It seems I need to

751
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,480
get Dongqing back.

752
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,040
Since she went to Fujian

753
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,080
with Linbo,

754
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,320
you've been exhausted.

755
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
In that case,

756
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,440
General Fu

757
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,800
the new commander

758
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,080
would hate me bitterly.

759
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,240
I'll interview a few
more people tomorrow.

760
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,600
I'm sure I can find someone capable.

761
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,840
Well.

762
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,520
My sister-in-law has solved it for me.

763
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,920
She'll leave for Zhangzhou Prefecture

764
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,000
as my brother is going to take office
in Bureau for Foreign Shipping there.

765
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,400
She can't take too many servants there,

766
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
so she has left some of the most capable

767
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,760
to me.

768
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,200
That's great.

769
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,040
We've been standing here for a while.

770
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,080
Shiyi,

771
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,200
why not ask all of us to take a seat?

772
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:04,840
Let's go.

773
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,040
Wuniang.

774
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,480
Let's go.

775
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,360
Come on.

776
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,200
Let's propose

777
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
the first toast to Mother.

778
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,240
No. Don't.

779
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,000
Put it down.

780
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,680
The first toast

781
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,560
is to Shiyi.

782
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,200
Mother, you're here with us.

783
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,520
How can we do that?

784
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,640
Xianling Pavilion is world-renowned now.

785
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,960
It has recruited many disciples

786
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,520
and the products have found
a good sale abroad.

787
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,840
His Majesty specially
granted a plaque

788
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,760
which reads
"Best Embroidery in the World".

789
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,080
Shiyi,

790
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,720
Master Jian and you

791
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,640
are an honor

792
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,960
to us women.

793
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,640
Mother, I'm flattered.

794
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,440
Come on.

795
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,560
Let's raise our glasses together.

796
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,240
Come on.

797
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,080
A peaceful family will prosper!

798
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,600
Wuniang, have some dishes.

799
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,560
Let's dig in.

800
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,120
What would you like to eat most?

801
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,880
Try this.

802
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,880
Mother, have a taste.

803
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,720
Okay.

804
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,920
(Fengtian Hall)
His Majesty's edict is as follows:

805
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,440
Xu-Luo Shiyi, wife of Marquis Yongping,

806
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,600
is virtuous and kind-hearted,
honest and faithful.

807
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,360
She's a woman of virtue.

808
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,840
By setting up the embroidery workshop
Xianling Pavilion

809
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,840
and recruiting many disciples,
she's carried the craftsmanship forward.

810
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,200
She's hardworking and reliable,
capable and independent.

811
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,200
The title of the First Standard Rank Madam
is therefore conferred on her.
