Mr. Ou,

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,640
about what I told you today, I mean it.

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm the one who should
leave Xianling Pavilion.

23
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,920
You really don't have to go.

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,320
Don't rush into any decisions.

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,880
I've been

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,840
thinking it over lately.

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,160
As a member of the Xu family,

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm duty-bound to
consider His Lordship's

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
and the Xu family's feelings.

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,520
It's not about you.

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,480
Follow me.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Do you still remember

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,440
how you felt

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,000
when you were making this embroidery?

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,080
Ask yourself this question:

36
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
wouldn't you feel sorry

37
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,960
if works such as this one,

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,600
on which you worked so hard,

39
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,680
should end up mothballed
in your boudoir,

40
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,680
and if your brilliant ideas

41
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,440
and craftsmanship

42
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,320
should fail to get passed on

43
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,280
in the service of others?

44
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,400
Greetings, Marquis Yongping.

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,560
My Lord,

46
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,800
what are you doing here?

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
It's getting late.

48
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,200
Let's go home.

49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,160
Wait for me in the carriage.

50
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,360
Marquis.

51
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,760
I hope there won't be
any misunderstanding.

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,760
Master Jian is my friend,

53
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
so I had to come

54
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,280
to celebrate her birthday.

55
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,080
Since my wife called you

56
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
a true gentleman,

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,160
I'll take her word for it.

58
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
I hope

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,160
you won't betray

60
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
her trust.

61
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,600
Since you're honest with me,

62
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
I'll tell you the truth, Marquis.

63
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,640
I did have a crush

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,960
on Shiyi

65
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
before I knew she's Madam Xu.

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,080
Now that I know it,

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,440
I won't embarrass myself

68
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,880
by pestering her,

69
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,840
not to mention doing anything reckless

70
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
that might tarnish
Madame Xu's reputation.

71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
Don't worry, Marquis.

72
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,720
A gentleman never goes back on his word.

73
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Marquis,

74
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,480
I've decided to withdraw
from Xianling Pavilion.

75
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,080
I've been sorting things out

76
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,720
with Master Jian.

77
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,800
In a few days,

78
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,240
I'll have nothing to do
with Xianling Pavilion.

79
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,740
(Xianling Pavilion)

80
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,920
Alas, a court official like me

81
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,200
should have been reduced

82
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,520
to looking after a drunken maid.

83
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:32,340
(Xianling Pavilion)

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
This lass

85
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
looks cute

86
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
when she's quiet.

87
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,600
General Fu,

88
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,160
what are you doing here?

89
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,640
Where's Her Ladyship?

90
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,880
You drank yourself into a stupor

91
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,160
in there,

92
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,680
so Wan Daxian sent Her Ladyship

93
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
and His Lordship home

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
and put you in my care.

95
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
What are you doing?

96
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,640
What am I doing?

97
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm taking you home.

98
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

99
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,200
What do you take me for?

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
I'm sorry, General Fu.

101
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,120
I misunderstood you.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
But I'm sober now.

103
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,560
I can find my way home.

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,550
You'd better go home, too.

105
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,840
I must get going.

106
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,150
Bye, General Fu.

107
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
How could a man like me

108
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,880
let a drunken girl

109
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,600
go home

110
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,400
on her own?

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,400
Let me get you home.

112
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,400
Get on the horse.

113
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,920
Hold on tight.

114
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,800
Hang on,

115
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
or you might fall off the horse.

116
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
Thank you, General Fu.

117
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
A lightweight like you

118
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,840
shouldn't drink like a fish

119
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
outside the home,

120
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
remember?

121
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Yes.

122
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,280
Young lady, why are you

123
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
so good and quiet today?

124
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,920
Not in a mood for talking back?

125
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,720
You're weird, General Fu.

126
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,280
Did you expect me to bicker with you?

127
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,160
Nonsense.

128
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,120
Don't get carried away.

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm alright, My Lord.

130
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
The wine went to my head.

131
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
It is Master Jian's birthday,

132
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,400
so I had a few more cups

133
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,800
than I could hold.

134
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,400
You really shouldn't

135
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,800
have drunk outside the home.

136
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,120
Remember you're the matron
of the Xu family?

137
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,360
It was thoughtless of me.

138
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,640
I'd love to drink at home

139
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,520
if you agree to drink with me.

140
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
OK.

141
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,160
I'll drink with you.

142
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,680
Which one do you prefer,

143
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,560
our home brew

144
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
or the wine from Xianling Pavilion?

145
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,600
Our home brew, of course.

146
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
But you'd rather drink

147
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,280
at Xianling Pavilion

148
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,680
than drink in the Mansion of Xu,

149
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,520
right?

150
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
No.

151
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,440
That's not true.

152
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,880
I have nothing against the Xu family.

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,080
Tell you what,

154
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,880
I didn't have a happy childhood

155
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,480
in the Residence of Luo,

156
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,760
as I always felt I was
walking on thin ice.

157
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,120
Luckily, Master Jian took me
as an apprentice

158
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,480
and taught me the art of embroidery.

159
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,840
I remember how I kept

160
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
visiting Xianling Pavilion

161
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,440
and having a great time there.

162
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,960
Those were the happiest
moments of my life.

163
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,360
I felt so free and at ease.

164
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
But I've thought things over.

165
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,160
As the matron of the Xu family,

166
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,320
I've got to prioritize the Xu family.

167
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,400
If they don't like me working there,

168
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,720
then I'll just

169
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,960
withdraw from Xianling Pavilion.

170
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,800
From now on,

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,120
I'll devote myself

172
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,720
to our household affairs.

173
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,000
I...

174
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,880
I've never considered

175
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
your work at Xianling Pavilion

176
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,200
a distraction from your duties at home,

177
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,800
so

178
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,160
you don't have to overthink it.

179
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,280
There's no need to
leave Xianling Pavilion

180
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,200
if you're really so fond of it.

181
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,880
As long as I'm here,

182
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,360
you can continue

183
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
doing what you want to do.

184
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,640
My Lord, you're so kind.

185
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,440
You're so good to me.

186
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,440
It's alright.

187
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,520
It's alright.

188
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
It's alright.

189
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,840
What's the matter?

190
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm so sorry

191
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,840
that I stabbed you

192
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,280
the other day.

193
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
I know

197
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,240
it was just an accident.

198
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,200
Shiyi.

199
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,760
(You've always been)

200
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
(so careful around me)

201
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
(that you'd even
leave Xianling Pavilion.)

202
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,760
(Is it because you care about me)

203
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,680
(or is it only because)

204
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,280
(you feel sorry?)

205
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,160
Good morning.

206
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,880
Good morning.

207
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,600
I was drunk last night.

208
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,640
Thanks for taking care of me, My Lord.

209
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,640
It's nothing.

210
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
Next time

211
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
you feel like drinking,

212
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
just come to me.

213
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
I'll drink with you.

214
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,640
I'll go and ask them
to prepare breakfast.

215
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,440
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship,

216
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
Amber requests an audience.

217
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,360
What's the matter?

218
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,200
Your Ladyship,

219
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,920
news just came from the Luo family

220
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
that Madam Luo is critically ill.

221
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,200
Marquis, please come with me

222
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,920
and have a seat in the side hall.

223
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,520
Qian Ming has gone to the farm village.

224
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,920
I had someone

225
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,640
send him the message
of mother's illness.

226
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,480
I'm sure he'll be back very soon.

227
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,310
Sister-in-law,

228
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,400
I heard

229
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,400
mother was getting better.

230
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
How did things get so bad?

231
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,830
The physician said

232
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,760
there was no hope for
mother to fully recover.

233
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,800
Her condition did begin to improve

234
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,240
with Erniang's problem solved.

235
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,560
But then somehow

236
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
her illness got worse.

237
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,440
Maybe we should try another physician.

238
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,080
We went to many different physicians.

239
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
Erniang.

240
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,360
Sister-in-law,

241
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,520
I came to visit mother

242
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,720
as soon as I heard of her illness.

243
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,520
Thank you, Erniang.

244
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
You still look

245
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,360
kind of pale.

246
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
I know you're young,

247
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,880
but you can't be too careful.

248
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,520
Take good care of yourself,

249
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,280
or it might become a chronic disease.

250
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,640
I owe my illness

251
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,200
to Shiyi

252
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
my good sister.

253
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,840
Stop acting like you care about me.

254
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,040
I won't buy it.

255
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,480
I'll go and see His Lordship.

256
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,280
Erniang,

257
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,040
it was thanks to Shiyi's help

258
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,440
that your problem

259
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,920
got solved.

260
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
Instead of thanking her,

261
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,520
you're now blaming her.

262
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,920
How could you do this?

263
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,840
Her help?

264
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,120
She was just using me

265
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
to deal with the Ou family.

266
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,560
Wuniang,

267
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,160
you're too naive

268
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,720
for your age.

269
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,760
Cut it out.

270
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,880
Why are you

271
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,680
still bickering now?

272
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,080
Did you forget about
your mother's illness?

273
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,240
If you don't want to visit your mother,

274
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,040
you might as well leave now.

275
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,360
They started the fight.

276
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,760
Why am I the only one who got scolded?

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,560
You...

278
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,400
You unfilial child.

279
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,640
Erniang,

280
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,800
haven't you missed

281
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,760
Concubine Yang?

282
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,320
Why don't you go and check up on her?

283
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,520
Mother, I've come to see you.

284
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,520
Lady Erniang,

285
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,880
you're finally back.

286
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,080
Mother.

287
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,920
Mother.

288
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Erniang.

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,640
Mother,

290
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,720
why didn't anyone

291
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
tell me you were so ill?

292
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm fine.

293
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,040
I'm happy

294
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
if you're doing well.

295
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,680
It's Her Ladyship.

296
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
Her Ladyship falsely charged her

297
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,640
of stealing money,

298
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
and had her kneel for
a whole night as punishment.

299
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,240
She caught cold
because of that.

300
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,000
Mother,

301
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,720
did you take any medicine?

302
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,800
What did the physician say?

303
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,200
Why isn't a physician here?

304
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
Why didn't anyone

305
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,320
tell me

306
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,280
mother is so ill?

307
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,320
Did Wuniang and Zhenxing know this?

308
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,320
Her Ladyship ordered

309
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,560
that no physician should be consulted

310
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
and that no decoction

311
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,760
should be prescribed.

312
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,560
Moreover,

313
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,440
Her Ladyship

314
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,960
had me so closely watched

315
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,920
that I couldn't send a message.

316
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
Old Master Luo

317
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
and Young Master Zhenxing
were stalled off

318
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,960
by some old biddies many times

319
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,600
when they wanted to
visit her.

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,920
Mother.

321
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,680
Is she

322
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,240
trying to kill my mother?

323
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,880
We've done so much for her

324
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,320
over the years.

325
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
Surely my mother deserves

326
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,400
a physician's treatment?

327
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,280
Mother.

328
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,520
Mother, please get up.

329
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,760
I'll take you to the physician.

330
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,480
Let's go.

331
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,560
Erniang,

332
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,760
I'm beyond cure.

333
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,240
Don't bother, my child.

334
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,080
Here.

335
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,520
This is all I've got now.

336
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,920
The rest

337
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,400
was taken away by Her Ladyship.

338
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,680
You can keep

339
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,960
what

340
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm left with,

341
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,760
as it might come in handy someday.

342
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,080
There's some money

343
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
under my pillow.

344
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,560
Take it as well.

345
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,280
No, no, mother.

346
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,320
I don't want anything else.

347
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,760
I just want you.

348
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
Silly child,

349
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,800
I can no longer be with you.

350
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,800
But

351
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I wish to see your father.

352
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
I wish to see him one last time.

353
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,000
I...

354
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,880
I wish to tell him

355
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,120
that if there's an afterlife,

356
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,880
I...

357
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,040
I'll never be a concubine again.

358
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,080
Mother.

359
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,480
Don't scare me.

360
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,280
Mother.

361
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,680
Mother, don't scare me.

362
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,840
Mother.

363
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,320
Mother.

364
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,280
Mother.

365
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,760
Mother.

366
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,680
Mother.

367
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,240
Remember Yuanniang's dying wish.

368
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Zhun has been entrusted to you.

369
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,600
Do take good care of him.

370
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,720
I will, mother.

371
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,120
Mother,

372
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm sure you'll get better.

373
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,560
I know

374
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,120
my condition.

375
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,720
Show them all in.

376
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,800
Yes, Your Ladyship.

377
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Zhenxing.

378
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,080
Mother.

379
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,400
I shall entrust our family

380
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,160
to your.

381
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,920
I know I can count on you.

382
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,400
Take care of our family.

383
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,000
You've been looking after
the family all your life.

384
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,560
Please relax

385
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,560
and take a good rest.

386
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,880
Your Ladyship,

387
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,360
please have some more ginseng soup.

388
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,600
Mother,

389
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,120
do you know

390
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,680
that Concubine Yang

391
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,000
just passed away?

392
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,800
Concubine Yang

393
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,960
beat me to it.

394
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,400
Has it ever occurred to you

395
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,520
why Yuanniang,

396
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,960
who was as calculating as you are,

397
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
died of such an early age?

398
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,360
Yuanniang.

399
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,160
Yuanniang.

400
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,360
Nobody cared about my natural mother

401
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,920
for she was just a concubine.

402
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,960
All of you were responsible

403
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,760
for her death.

404
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,880
Our family is in a mess now.

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
Will you stop making trouble?

406
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,280
Father,

407
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,200
you only care about her.

408
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,680
What about my natural mother?

409
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,920
She stayed by your side

410
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,320
for so many years.

411
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,280
Yet nobody paid her a visit

412
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,240
while she was on her deathbed.

413
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,000
She said

414
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,680
she wanted to see you one last time.

415
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,480
She wouldn't have died

416
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,760
if you had shown her
a bit more kindness.

417
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,920
I should be blamed.

418
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
I did her wrong.

419
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,080
Mother.

420
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Mother.

421
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,600
Mother.

422
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,080
Mother.

423
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,560
Mother.

424
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,120
Mother.

425
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
Mother.

426
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,000
Your Ladyship,
what are you thinking about?

427
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,640
I'm thinking about what happened
in the past few days.

428
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,960
Mother

429
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,320
Concubine Yang,

430
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,000
and Erniang,

431
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,560
I used to hate them.

432
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
But now I only feel pity for them.

433
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,680
Mother spent her whole life

434
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,160
scheming and calculating to entrench

435
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,760
her place as matron of the family,

436
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,040
but it turned out to be all in vain.

437
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,080
Knowing her own status, Concubine Yang

438
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,320
did everything to please others,

439
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,400
only to be disappointed.

440
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,120
Erniang tried to change her destiny

441
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,600
as the daughter of a concubine

442
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,840
by acting aggressively

443
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,960
and recklessly,

444
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,120
which has left scars

445
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,280
on her in the end.

446
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Be they legal wives,

447
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,120
concubines,

448
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,240
or daughters of either,

449
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
women always seem

450
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,400
to fall prey

451
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,480
to the same miserable fate.

452
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,960
Your Ladyship.

453
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,260
(Mourning)

454
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,040
Where is father?

455
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,320
Father has been hard hit

456
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,560
by the deaths of mother

457
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,360
and Concubine Yang.

458
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,600
He has fallen ill.

459
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,920
Then how are we going to handle

460
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,840
the funeral?

461
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,680
We have to work out a plan

462
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,360
after some discussion,

463
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,520
and then ask father to make a decision.

464
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,240
The Luo family is prestigious

465
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
in the capital.

466
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,440
Mother-in-law's funeral

467
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,080
ought to be of high standards.

468
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,800
Mother devoted her whole life
to the Luo family;

469
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,040
her funeral deserves meticulousness.

470
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,000
But

471
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,120
since father hasn't been reinstated yet

472
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,160
and that he's lost touch

473
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,520
with his former colleagues at court,

474
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,200
the funeral will have to
be a subdued one.

475
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,040
But a simple funeral

476
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,720
might disgrace father.

477
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,800
Don't worry, Zhenxing.

478
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,960
The Xu family can help manage

479
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,840
the funeral.

480
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,560
How could we do that?

481
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
How dare we trouble you, Marquis?

482
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,920
It would be improper.

483
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,200
We can't do that.

484
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,680
I'm a son-in-law of the Luo family,

485
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,840
and I'm supposed

486
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,600
to repay mother-in-law's kindness

487
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
for bringing up Yuanniang and Shiyi.

488
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,320
Don't overthink the matter, Zhenxing.

489
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,840
Marquis, I'll never forget

490
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,320
your graciousness.

491
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,680
There's no need of that, Zhenxing.

492
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,560
With Marquis's assistance

493
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,440
in the arrangements,

494
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,840
we'll have a proper funeral
for mother-in-law.

495
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
I'm sure this will ease

496
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,680
father-in-law's grief to some extent.

497
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,560
Mother-in-law would be pleased

498
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,000
if she knew it.

499
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,840
We don't know

500
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,560
how to repay your kindness, Marquis.

501
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,040
If Shiyi agrees,

502
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,120
I'll suggest to father

503
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,840
that Concubine Lv's memorial tablet

504
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,440
be admitted to the Luo family's
ancestral hall.

505
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,640
I'm sure father will give his consent.

506
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,800
What do you think, Shiyi?

507
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,160
Only a legal wife is allowed

508
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,680
to have her memorial tablet

509
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,560
enshrined in the ancestral hall
after her demise.

510
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,560
Shiyi,

511
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
just say yes.

512
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,920
Thank you, Zhenxing.

513
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,560
-I...
-In that case,

514
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,880
I'll have my natural mother's
memorial tablet

515
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,120
moved into the ancestral hall as well.

516
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,600
Say no more about it.

517
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,360
Father won't agree.

518
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Marquis,

519
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,760
let me tell you a secret.

520
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,360
Shiyi had no wish

521
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,880
to marry you in the first place.

522
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,600
Concubine Lv died

523
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,120
when she was running away
from home.

524
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,160
I knew it a long time ago.

525
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,800
You didn't have to snitch on Shiyi.

526
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,560
You knew it?

527
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,560
So...

528
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,800
Shiyi is my wife.

529
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,360
Of course she's honest with me

530
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,640
on everything.

531
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,640
No one could drive a wedge between us.

532
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,200
Zhenxing,

533
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,480
I didn't finish my words.

534
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,200
I appreciate

535
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,680
your kindness.

536
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,440
But I know my natural mother

537
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,800
wasn't meant to

538
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,160
be a concubine,

539
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,640
and I believe

540
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,640
she wouldn't want to continue staying

541
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,960
in the Residence of Luo as a concubine.

542
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,040
So I'd rather enshrine
her memorial tablet

543
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,840
on my own.

544
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,840
If that is the case,

545
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,760
we'll comply with your wish.

546
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,000
I've had enough

547
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,760
this life.

548
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,840
If there is an afterlife,

549
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
I...

550
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,360
I...

551
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,520
I'll never be a concubine again.

552
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,120
I'll take my natural mother's
memorial tablet with me

553
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,720
if it can't be admitted
to the ancestral hall.

554
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,480
If she had to remain a concubine

555
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,160
in the Residence of Luo
even after death,

556
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,160
I'm afraid she'd never find ease

557
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,160
in many lifetimes to come.

558
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,560
We'll have nothing to say

559
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,800
if you insist on doing so.

560
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,120
But, Erniang,

561
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,520
do remember that the Luo family

562
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,640
is your parents' home no matter what.

563
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:32,140
(Residence of Luo)
(Mourning)

564
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,680
Young Madam,

565
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,280
you didn't have to do that.

566
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,640
You've got an adopted child now,

567
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,320
so you'll be living on easy street

568
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
if you get along with the Luo family

569
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,880
and the Xu family,

570
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,640
but you had to...

571
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,640
I lost my natural mother

572
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,680
because of them.

573
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,360
How could I look to them

574
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,440
for backing?

575
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,200
I'd rather die

576
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,400
than do that.

577
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,520
Young Madam.

578
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,960
Jinlian,

579
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,480
did I do the wrong thing?

580
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,600
I just wanted to be better off,

581
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,630
but how...

582
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,480
How did I end up

583
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,190
in this plight?

584
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,150
What's the point

585
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,360
in living like this?

586
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,880
Young Madam. Young Madam.

587
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,230
Young Madam.

588
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,880
Young Madam.

589
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,000
Young Madam.

590
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,820
(Rites)

591
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,560
My Lord.

592
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,360
Thank you, My Lord,

593
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,000
for managing mother's funeral

594
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,880
and helping keep up
the Luo family's decency.

595
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,320
I'll never forget your kindness.

596
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,560
As your husband, I'm supposed

597
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,920
to support you when you're in trouble.

598
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,720
It's nothing.

599
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,880
Earlier

600
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,240
Erniang mentioned

601
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,160
that I tried to flee our marriage,

602
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,600
and I couldn't find a chance

603
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,200
to explain myself, My Lord.

604
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,360
-Let bygones be bygones.
-I...

605
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,320
There's no need to explain.

606
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,160
I've got something
important to deal with.

607
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,960
I must be off now.

608
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,720
Erniang was right.

609
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,800
At first

610
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
I didn't want to marry you,

611
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,040
and I tried running away.

612
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,720
So when you found out

613
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,760
that the Xu family was involved

614
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,080
in your mother's death,

615
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,040
you decided

616
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,360
to marry me

617
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,240
against your will.

618
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes.

619
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,160
It was like that at the beginning.

620
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,400
-But later...
-When evidence showed

621
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,720
that I was to blame
for your mother's death,

622
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,240
you believed it without hesitation.

623
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,320
In your heart,

624
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,480
I'm not

625
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,640
trustworthy,

626
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,640
so you never trusted me.

627
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,480
I'm sorry, My Lord.

628
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,040
It was my fault.

629
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,240
So all this time

630
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,560
you're just trying to make amends

631
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
for your guilt.

632
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,080
What do you

633
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,680
take me for?

634
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,960
I know

635
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,840
you've always been good to me, My Lord.

636
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,120
You've defended me

637
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,680
and protected me

638
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
even if I hurt you.

639
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,760
It was entirely my fault.

640
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,480
I let you down, My Lord.

641
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,680
So

642
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
your feelings for me

643
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,400
are just guilt and gratitude,

644
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,280
right?

645
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,940
(Rites)

646
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,800
Father,

647
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,720
I went to Banyuepan

648
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,560
but didn't find you there,

649
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,240
so I had to come here for you.

650
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,640
Yu.

651
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,960
It's my mother's birthday today.

652
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,160
I hope father could go and see her.

653
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
Greetings, mother.

654
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,160
I'll go and see her

655
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,360
since it's her birthday.

656
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,520
Let's go.

657
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,520
Thank you, father.

658
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,740
(Rites)

659
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,800
Your Ladyship,

660
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,520
His Lordship is gone.

661
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,800
I'd like to take a walk in the garden.

662
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,960
But it looks like

663
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,320
it's going to rain.

664
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,680
Come back soon

665
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,080
if you have to go there.
