Mr. Ou?

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,160
It's them.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,160
Madam Xu?

Young Master. Young Master.

24

It's Madam Xu.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,080
Mr. Ou, what brought you here?

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,160
Master Jian and I

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,400
heard Marquis Yongping had an accident,

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
and you were expelled by Xu family.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,360
I was quite worried,

30
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,320
so I came here and check on you.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,120
I'm fine. No need to worry.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,400
I saw what happened earlier.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,800
How can I believe that you are fine?

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
Look at your hands.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,120
You are so passionate about embroidery.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
You shouldn't ruin your hands

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,960
on a tough job like that.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,160
Even if something bad happens
to Marquis Yongping,

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,760
it's not your fault.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
They shouldn't blame you.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,760
I misunderstood His Lordship

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,560
and hurt his feelings.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
I feel sorry for what I did to him.

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
I should be punished.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Misunderstood?

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
Can you be sure

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,000
that you really misunderstood him?

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
Come to think of it,

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,160
the evidence

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,040
all led me to suspect His Lordship.

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
It's my fault that I was being impulsive

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,480
and wasn't thinking straight,

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,720
having my mind clouded by doubts.

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,400
Now that I think about it again,

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
it must be someone
who misled me on purpose.

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,880
Shiyi, are you saying that

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,520
because I'm one of the Ou family?

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,400
You suspect that I gave you

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,440
all the clues on purpose

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,680
in order to make you
hate Marquis Yongping?

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm not suspecting you.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,680
It's just that the Ou family

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,000
and the Xu family have held a grudge
against each other for long.

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,640
I don't want you

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,240
to help me anymore.

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,760
Mr. Ou, please leave.

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,320
Too many eyes are watching.

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
If people see you are here,

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
they'll misunderstand us again.

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,240
I understand.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
Take good care of yourself.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,680
Amber.

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,920
Mr. Ou's hand is hurt.

75
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,440
Go get some medicine for him.

76
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,520
Yes, Your Ladyship.

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,440
Mr. Ou,

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
thank you for traveling a long way here

79
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,320
to help us.

80
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,240
But there's something

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
I have to say to you.

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,640
His Lordship's whereabouts is unknown.

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,440
You'd better leave here

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,440
in case of any trouble.

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
If the Xu family finds out that you

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,840
and Her Ladyship still
talk to each other,

87
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200
they'll blame you

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
for His Lordship's

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,440
accident for sure.

90
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm not afraid since
I've done nothing wrong.

91
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
What matters the most right now

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,760
is Shiyi's safety.

93
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,520
How can I leave knowing

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,440
that she's suffering here?

95
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
But what if...

96
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,120
Don't worry.

97
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
I will be careful.

98
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
I won't let the Xu family find out,

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,960
and I won't put Shiyi in trouble.

100
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,720
Mr. Ou, you are from a wealthy family.

101
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,120
Why do you have to hide
in this shabby place

102
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,080
and make yourself suffer?

103
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,840
There aren't so many reasons.

104
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,080
I'm doing this because I want to.

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
Neat stitches

106
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,720
layered with bright colors.

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
Obviously, it's

108
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
Shiyi's work.

109
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,600
Mr. Ou, good eye.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Her Ladyship made
this Bodhisattva's portrait

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
to pray safety for His Lordship.

112
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,120
But I see her working hard

113
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,520
all day long.

114
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
How could she still have time for this?

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,200
Her Ladyship

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,920
sacrificed her sleeping time for it.

117
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,280
We couldn't stop her
no matter how hard we tried.

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Mr. Ou, look.

119
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,720
The stitches here

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,960
were originally made

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,960
of black silk thread.

122
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,040
But

123
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
we ran out of

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
black silk thread,

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,280
so Her Ladyship

126
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,000
thought of using

127
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,720
her hair instead.

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,120
To our surprise,

129
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,680
it turned out to be even
better than silk thread.

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Because of that,

131
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,160
we finally saw Her Ladyship smile.

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Amber,

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,320
you and Dongqing

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,720
have got to take good care of her.

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,640
She is so passionate about embroidery

136
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
and she's very gifted.

137
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
If her hands get hurt,

138
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,320
she'll never be able to do that again.

139
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
Mr. Ou, no worries.

140
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,120
Dongqing and I

141
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,840
will certainly take good
care of Her Ladyship.

142
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,720
You also need to take
good care of yourselves.

143
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,720
Mr. Ou, don't just think of us.

144
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,640
You should take care
of yourself as well.

145
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,600
You need to change medicine regularly.

146
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,920
Thank you.

147
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,200
Who are you?

148
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,160
Why do you want to kill me?

149
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,600
Stop.

150
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,120
Stop.

151
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,960
Guards, take him.

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,520
Freeze.

153
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Don't move.

154
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,880
Oh,

155
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
it's you.

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Take him away.

157
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,600
-Move.
-Hurry.

158
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,280
Move.

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Your Ladyship, sorry about that.

160
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,920
Chief steward, thank you for saving me.

161
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,720
I should thank you, Your Ladyship.

162
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
If it hadn't been for you,

163
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,480
I wouldn't have been able

164
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
to catch this ungrateful rascal.

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,240
What?

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Someone in the farm
attempted to kill you?

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,080
Your Ladyship.

168
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,840
Are you out of your mind?

169
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,670
Chief steward,

170
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,520
no matter what,

171
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm still Marquis Yongping's wife,

172
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,240
the matron of Xu family.

173
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,400
If anything happens

174
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
to me here,

175
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,880
you'll be held accountable for it.

176
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,520
So, what are you going to do,
Your Ladyship?

177
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,240
Move.

178
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,120
How come you are still here?

179
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Antai said

180
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,200
that someone just attacked you.

181
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
Shiyi,

182
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,120
what happened to you exactly?

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm fine.

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,520
You don't need to worry.

185
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,080
No.

186
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
If you don't tell me,

187
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,440
I won't leave here whatsoever.

188
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
A few days ago,

189
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
someone went through my stuff

190
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
and pushed me into a well,

191
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,120
but nothing was stolen,

192
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,920
which means he wasn't going after money.

193
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,920
So,

194
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,760
just now, I was trying to lure him out.

195
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
I didn't expect

196
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,040
that he is the assistant steward.

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
The assistant steward?

198
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,880
He didn't go after money,

199
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,840
and he has nothing against you.

200
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,960
Think again.

201
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,280
Is there anything

202
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,680
valuable among

203
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,680
your belongings?

204
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,520
The embroidery cloth.

205
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,040
Was he trying to steal
my embroidery cloth?

206
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,320
Maybe the murderer
who killed your mother

207
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,440
started to make a move on you.

208
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,920
It's possible.

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,320
But like you said,

210
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,440
the assistant steward
has nothing against me.

211
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,800
And he didn't go after my money.

212
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,040
So it only means

213
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,840
that someone asked him to do it.

214
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,320
Now that he's caught by you,

215
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,920
the person who's behind this

216
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
may not give up easily.

217
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,840
He may even plan on killing you.

218
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,760
No.

219
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,520
You must leave here right now.

220
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,600
I finally found some leads.

221
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,600
I won't leave.

222
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,920
Alright.

223
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,360
I've told you what happened.

224
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
You can leave now.

225
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,440
I have the chief steward
to help me here.

226
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,520
You need not to worry.

227
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
The chief steward?

228
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
Don't you remember how he treated you?

229
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:06,380
(Grain)

230
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
Wang Jinzhong.

231
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,280
How dare you

232
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,440
attempt to kill Her Ladyship?

233
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
We have nothing against each other.

234
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,280
Why did you try to kill me?

235
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Who asked you to do it?

236
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,280
Wang Jinzhong.

237
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,680
Have you thought

238
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
about your current situation?

239
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,040
You failed your mission,

240
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
so you've been disavowed.

241
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Who would care about

242
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
a disavowed person's life?

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
At the moment,

244
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,080
only the Xu family can protect you.

245
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,360
As long as you tell me

246
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,680
who's behind this,

247
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,640
the Xu family will
guarantee your safety.

248
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,680
But you can't even protect yourself,

249
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
how could you make sure

250
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,360
that the Xu family can protect me?

251
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
Whoever wants to kill me

252
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,400
will surely do harm to Xu family.

253
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,520
Therefore, the Xu family
won't sit back and watch.

254
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,920
Think carefully.

255
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,240
This is

256
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,120
your only chance to stay alive.

257
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,360
Say it.

258
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,360
Who asked you to do it?

259
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,960
Alright. Alright.

260
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,080
I'll say it.

261
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,280
I'll say it.

262
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,240
Actually...

263
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
Actually the one who wants
to kill Her Ladyship is...

264
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
Screw you.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,440
Stop.

266
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,680
You won't let me off even if I tell you.

267
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,720
-Hurry.
-Get him.

268
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,320
Kill all of them.

269
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,400
Protect Her Ladyship.

270
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,240
Shiyi, are you alright?

271
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,080
Mr. Ou.

272
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,720
It's dangerous here. Run.

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,480
Watch out.

274
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
Mr. Ou.

275
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,720
Run.

Has your wound healed?

290
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Almost.

291
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,840
They all said that the fire killed you.

292
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,160
But I just didn't believe it.

293
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,400
When I was ordered to go to Shandong,

294
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,080
you were misled into suspecting me.

295
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,800
So I thought that the Shandong trip

296
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
could also be part of their plan.

297
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
So I kept alert on my way.

298
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,120
Not long after,

299
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,400
I found that

300
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,920
some people were sneaking around

301
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,320
and waited to make a move.

302
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
So you deliberately

303
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,720
set the inn on fire

304
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,320
to lure out those people?

305
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Although I suspected that they

306
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,920
were sent by Ou family,

307
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,400
I wasn't quite sure

308
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,080
until the Ou family

309
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,120
thought that I was killed by the fire

310
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,520
and started their evildoings
without any scruple.

311
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,480
They even

312
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,760
made me a scapegoat for

313
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
the embezzlement they did in Shandong.

314
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,200
After it's confirmed,

315
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,680
I got back on them

316
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
without they preparing for it.

317
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,560
In order to make them believe

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,350
that you were killed by the fire,

319
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,520
the fire must've been very fierce.

320
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,350
You were badly injured.

321
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,590
It must have been quite difficult

322
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,840
for you to escape.

323
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
How did you know I was here?

324
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,280
On my way back,

325
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,600
I bumped into Wan Daxian

326
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,880
and learned that Mother was mad at you,

327
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,280
so I rushed here.

328
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,720
Actually, you could've showed

329
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,400
them the Divorce Agreement

330
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,920
and left Xu family.

331
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,760
Why did you

332
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
come here and make

333
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,560
yourself suffer?

334
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,480
How could I just take the

335
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,360
Divorce Agreement and leave?

336
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
I wouldn't leave.

337
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
I was still waiting for you
to come back.

338
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,160
Who are those people

339
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,560
in black?

340
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,240
What happened here?

341
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,800
I'm not sure

342
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
who those people in black are.

343
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
But the assistant steward here

344
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,840
has been bought off

345
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,800
and attempted to kill me.

346
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,280
The chief steward caught him.

347
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,400
When we were just trying to
find out who's behind this,

348
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,520
he was shot to death by an arrow.

349
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,760
So you are sure

350
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,040
that those people were here for you.

351
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,920
They wanted to kill you.

352
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,840
Then what about Ou Yanxing?

353
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
What is he doing here?

354
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,880
Master Jian was worried about me,

355
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
so she asked Ou Yanxing

356
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,080
to come here and check on me.

357
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,440
By the way, My Lord,

358
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,760
do you still remember that coroner,

359
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,120
the one who led me

360
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,880
into suspecting you?

361
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,040
He was actually found by Ou Yanxing.

362
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,480
But I know Ou Yanxing very well.

363
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,040
He wouldn't do such thing.

364
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,480
So I suspect

365
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,800
that he was used.

366
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
And the people who are able

367
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,680
to use him without him knowing it

368
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,200
can only be the Ou family.

369
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,720
So you think

370
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,760
it's the Ou family who killed

371
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,000
your mother?

372
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,280
It's just a conjecture.

373
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,760
Thank you

374
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,400
for saving my wife

375
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,680
when her life was in danger.

376
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,560
Marquis Yongping,

377
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,800
to be honest,

378
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,920
the coroner who misled Madam Xu

379
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,920
was found by me.

380
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,480
I made a careless mistake.

381
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,120
Please don't misunderstand Madam Xu.

382
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,760
I trust my wife,

383
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,760
but I don't trust the Ou family.

384
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,040
You can misunderstand me,

385
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,240
but please try to understand

386
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,640
Madam Xu's anxiety

387
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,040
for the truth.

388
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,520
It's between me and my wife.

389
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,760
It's none of anybody else's business.

390
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,480
Mr. Ou,

391
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,680
thank you for

392
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,200
taking care of me these days.

393
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,720
His Lordship and I will go home now.

394
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,000
It's been so many days.

395
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
Why is there still

396
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,880
no news from Shandong?

397
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,160
Mother, no news

398
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,040
is unnecessarily a bad thing.

399
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,000
Great Madam.

400
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,280
Good news.

401
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,200
His Lordship sent a message,

402
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,280
saying he's fine

403
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,880
and he'll be home soon.

404
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,960
Lingyi is alive.

405
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,240
That's so great.

406
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,280
I just knew

407
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
that a tough man like him

408
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,880
wouldn't die easily.

409
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,120
Steward Bai,

410
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,480
prepare some good wine.

411
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,760
I'll have a drink tonight

412
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
to celebrate.

413
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,080
Yes.

414
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,480
That's great.

415
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,760
Mother,

416
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,800
now we can finally be relieved.

417
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,280
Danyang.

418
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,320
Master Lingkuan.

419
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,240
Danyang.

420
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,040
Danyang.

421
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,480
Danyang.

422
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
Fiftth Madam is asleep already,
Master Lingkuan.

423
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,680
Asleep?

424
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,080
Then I won't wake her up.

425
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,720
Help me...

426
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,920
Help me to the East Chamber to sleep.

427
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,080
Yes.

428
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,200
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

429
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,680
(To Make A Pleasant Thing Happen)
Careful, Master Lingkuan.

430
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,520
Water.

431
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,080
Water.

432
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,360
Xiaolan?

433
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,280
What are you doing here?

434
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,320
It's all my fault.

435
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,080
I was confused.

436
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,320
Danyang.

437
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,760
You can hit me. You can yell at me.

438
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
But please don't ignore me.

439
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,880
It's alright.

440
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,640
It's not a big deal.

441
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,560
Lingkuan, you don't have
to be like this.

442
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,520
Help Lingkuan to get up.

443
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,600
If others see this,

444
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,120
they'll laugh at us.

445
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,120
-Master Lingkuan.
-Danyang.

446
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,800
Please trust me.

447
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,240
You are the only one I love

448
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,320
and I'll love you forever.

449
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,040
Last night

450
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,120
it was just a misunderstanding.

451
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,800
That's right, Madam.

452
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,720
Last night

453
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
Master Lingkuan was drunk.

454
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
He mistook me for you.

455
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,280
That's why...

456
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,480
Madam, I'm willing to be punished.

457
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,560
It's okay.

458
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,400
Look how scared you are.

459
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,000
Just get up.

460
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
Since you've slept

461
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,080
with Lingkuan,

462
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
how can I

463
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,000
punish you?

464
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
I will not punish you, instead,

465
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,720
I'll make you a concubine.

466
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,400
From now on,

467
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,480
you will serve Lingkuan
together with me.

468
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,240
Madam, thank you.

469
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,200
By the way,

470
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,200
you and Xiaodie have
been friends for years.

471
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,360
You may not be used to another maid.

472
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,840
I'll let Xiaodie

473
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,560
be your maid. How's that?

474
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,200
Yes, Madam.

475
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,120
Lingkuan,

476
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,880
do you think my arrangement

477
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,480
is proper?

478
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
I swear.

479
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,120
I won't do such

480
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,760
ridiculous thing ever again.

481
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,840
Master Lingkuan,

482
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,840
His Lordship is back.

483
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,280
He's arrived at the front gate.

484
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,480
Lingkuan, go and welcome His Lordship.

485
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,000
It's inconvenient for me to walk.

486
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
I'll just stay here.

487
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,320
Then take a good rest.

488
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,640
You may leave now.

489
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Yes, Madam.

490
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,640
Madam,

491
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,600
why did you do that?

492
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,320
If you are upset,

493
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,760
just send Xiaolan away.

494
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,440
Send this Xiaolan away,

495
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,720
there may come another Xiaolan.

496
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,040
Besides, Jie's matter

497
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,760
caused such a chaos last time.

498
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,680
My father was quite angry

499
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,600
with Lingkuan.

500
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,520
If he knows about this,

501
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,200
he won't let Lingkuan off easily,

502
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
which will hurt

503
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,760
my relationship with Lingkuan.

504
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,880
And people will criticize me

505
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,680
for being jealous.

506
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
In that case,

507
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,040
I'll put myself and my baby

508
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,080
in a difficult position.

509
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,240
Madam, you've become

510
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,000
so sensible.

511
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
It actually makes

512
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
me feel even sadder.

513
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,280
Nanny Shi, you told me

514
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,760
that I'll be a mother soon;

515
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
I can't be that willful anymore.

516
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,600
My Lord, you are back.

517
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,800
Mother.

518
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,240
My son, rise.

519
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,960
Please rise.

520
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,600
My son.

521
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
I've been looking forward
to your return.

522
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,040
Do you know that?

523
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,680
You are the protector

524
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,240
and the pillar of Xu family.

525
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,880
I can't live without you.

526
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,840
Mother, it's my fault.

527
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,360
I'm sorry that I made you worried.

528
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,200
Mother,

529
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,840
it's a happy thing
that His Lordship is back.

530
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,320
He had a long journey.

531
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,680
Let's go inside first.

532
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,800
Okay. Go inside.

533
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,440
Let's go inside.

534
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:23,880
Mother.

535
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Wait a moment.

536
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,320
Shiyi?

537
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,760
Shiyi.

538
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,040
Mother.

539
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,360
Why did you bring her back?

540
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,160
Shiyi is my wife.

541
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,200
Of course I'll take her back.

542
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,000
I won't allow it.

543
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
This woman

544
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,560
attempted to hurt her husband.

545
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,760
I won't allow her

546
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,720
to step into our Xu family.

547
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,040
Mother, you misunderstood.

548
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,040
It's not like what you think.

549
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,960
There are too many people passing by.

550
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,840
Let's go in first.

551
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,240
I'll explain it to you.

552
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,840
I've heard what you said.

553
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,000
But it's a fact that Shiyi stabbed you.

554
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,120
I was going to deal with her

555
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,320
after you are back.

556
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,640
But this woman

557
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,240
actually dared hurt her own husband.

558
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,040
Our Xu family has no place

559
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,080
for such a sinful person.

560
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,920
Mother,

561
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,560
it's all my fault.

562
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,880
-I...
-Mother,

563
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,360
it's just a misunderstanding.

564
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,360
I made myself hurt

565
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,720
on purpose.

566
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,920
And the wound wasn't

567
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,240
as serious as you thought.

568
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,400
It was all

569
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,320
an act to fool the Ou family.

570
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,440
To help me

571
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,920
make it work, Shiyi

572
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,360
suffered a lot.

573
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
She didn't do anything wrong,

574
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,040
instead, she made a contribution.

575
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,840
My Lord.

576
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,480
Lingyi,

577
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,480
are you making it up

578
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,440
and lying to me so that

579
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,280
you can protect her?

580
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,760
Mother, you've seen it.

581
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,120
Hadn't we done that,

582
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,600
the Ou family wouldn't have

583
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
fallen into our plan.

584
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
It matters to the future
of our Xu family.

585
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,680
I dare not lie to you, Mother.

586
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,160
Mother,

587
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,400
I told you that you misunderstood Shiyi.

588
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,080
Shiyi actually made a contribution.

589
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,400
You should reward her.

590
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,120
Lingyi, please rise.

591
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,080
My son,

592
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,720
you are the one who suffered

593
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,960
and repeatedly got injured.

594
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,600
As long as you are okay with it,

595
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,560
I have nothing more to say.

596
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's put an end to it.

597
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,920
I won't ask any longer.

598
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Lingyi,

599
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,160
you had a long journey.

600
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,840
Go back now.

601
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,360
Yizhen.

602
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,560
what do you think about

603
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,480
Lingyi's words?

604
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,680
I think

605
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,240
it doesn't matter if we

606
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,200
believe his words.

607
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,480
What matters

608
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,240
is His Lordship's heart.

609
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,280
I certainly understand

610
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,040
why he said that.

611
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,280
I'm just worried

612
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,560
that Lingyi's forgiveness

613
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,520
will bring him trouble in the future.

614
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,280
If His Lordship weren't
discerning enough,

615
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
our Xu family wouldn't

616
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
be able to get where we are today.

617
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,280
You think too much, Mother.

618
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,960
I hope so, too.

619
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,960
I've been hoping Lingyi

620
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,240
can find someone he loves.

621
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,360
They will understand each other
and lead a happy life.

622
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,240
Everybody can see how much

623
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,560
he cares about Shiyi.

624
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,080
But that makes me

625
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,000
worried even more.

626
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,320
He'll make himself hurt

627
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,160
if he falls for her too much.

628
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,200
Actually, Shiyi

629
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,280
is not an ungrateful person.

630
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,560
I'm sure

631
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
that she won't let His Lordship down.

632
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,720
His Lordship is so blessed

633
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,520
that he can return safely.

634
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
His Lordship is blessed

635
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,160
and came back safely.

636
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,920
But I didn't expect

637
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,760
that Her Ladyship came back, too.

638
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,230
And I don't understand

639
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,190
why His Lordship made up that story

640
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,480
to protect her.

641
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,080
Maybe

642
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,800
it was really a misunderstanding

643
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,230
as His Lordship told.

644
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,520
Misunderstanding?

645
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
We saw it in person

646
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,800
that Her Ladyship stabbed His Lordship.

647
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,360
Forget it.

648
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,630
Even Great Madam has let it go.

649
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,480
It's not our place

650
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
to make it a big deal.

651
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,670
But there's one thing

652
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,920
we can't get away with.

653
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,000
You mean

654
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,520
defying His Lordship's order

655
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,150
and giving Her Ladyship away?

656
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,840
About that,

657
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,960
we had no other choice.

658
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,760
Right?

659
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Wen,

660
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,560
I didn't

661
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,480
say anything on that day.

662
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,040
How does it

663
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,640
become my own fault?

664
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
Concubine Qin

665
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,640
appears to be quiet,

666
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,640
but she's actually very sly.

667
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,800
My Lord.

668
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,800
I deserve to be punished

669
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,040
in whichever way.

670
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,440
You shouldn't have covered for me again.

671
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,720
As long as you are my wife,

672
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,840
I will protect you

673
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,120
from being hurt.

674
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,440
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,040
Don't apologize anymore.

676
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,400
And don't mention it again.

677
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,760
Although I went to Shandong,

678
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,040
I still sent people

679
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,680
to investigate your mother's death.

680
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,840
The hunter you said

681
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,760
has been killed by a wild animal.

682
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,520
The coroner has also gone missing.

683
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,920
Even if you suspect the Ou family,

684
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,440
we don't have any evidence.

685
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,320
I've been thinking.

686
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,160
My mother and the Ou family
had nothing against each other.

687
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,600
Why would they kill her?

688
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,200
Some officials have
connections with the pirates,

689
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,360
and the Ou family
is the biggest suspect.

690
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,040
If that's the case,

691
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Liu Yong could be meeting the Ou family

692
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,080
at Ci'an Temple on that day.

693
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,560
My mother

694
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
might run into them by accident

695
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,320
so they killed her.

696
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,960
My Lord, look.

697
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,520
My mother had this piece

698
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,960
of embroidery cloth

699
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,440
in her hand when she died.

700
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,760
I think she ripped it off

701
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,840
from the killer's clothes.

702
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,400
Oh, right.

703
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,920
I found a handkerchief

704
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
from Yu and

705
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,320
the pattern on it

706
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
is exactly the same as this.

707
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,680
With that being said,

708
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,920
maybe the Ou family has

709
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,320
put a spy in our Xu family.

710
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,600
Your Ladyship,

711
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,920
Concubine Wen is here to see you.

712
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,680
Greetings, Your Ladyship, Your Lordship.

713
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,480
Your Ladyship, I'm so happy

714
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,400
that you came back today.

715
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,360
I prepared a small

716
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,600
welcome back gift for you.

717
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,400
Hope you'll like it.

718
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
You think doing this

719
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,400
can make up for your mistake?

720
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,080
My Lord,

721
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
I know I made a mistake.

722
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,680
I failed

723
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,480
in following your order

724
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,880
and keeping the secret from Great Madam.

725
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,360
Because of me,

726
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,280
Her Ladyship was sent to the farm.

727
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,400
But I really

728
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,160
had no other choice.

729
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,680
It really hurt

730
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
when they

731
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,560
flogged me.

732
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,440
My Lord,

733
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,000
Your Ladyship,

734
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,480
please

735
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,840
forgive me

736
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,160
on account of Yu.

737
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,200
Please rise.

738
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,080
I know you had no choice.

739
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,880
His Lordship and I
are both sensible people.

740
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,640
We won't blame you for it.

741
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,080
On account of Shiyi,

742
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,640
I'll go easy on you.

743
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
Copy the family rules for 100 times.

744
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,080
Conduct yourself from now on.

745
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,840
If I hear

746
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,920
any gossip

747
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,800
about that day again,

748
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
I won't forgive you.

749
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,720
Yes.

750
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,280
My Lord, don't worry.

751
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
I will behave myself

752
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,680
and watch my mouth.

753
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,880
You may leave now.

754
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,440
Then I'll take my leave.

755
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,420
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

756
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,760
Luckily, Her Ladyship is broad-minded,

757
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,800
so His Lordship didn't
punish you seriously.

758
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,680
His Lordship just wanted

759
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,920
to make Shiyi look good

760
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,240
and warn me not

761
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,760
to gossip again.

762
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,320
Concubine Wen shouldn't

763
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
be the Ou family's spy.

764
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,080
Yu is everything to her.

765
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,080
She wouldn't

766
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,520
put such obvious

767
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,280
evidence on Yu.

768
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,480
This person is hiding in the dark
and watching us.

769
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,560
And

770
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,200
after this incident,

771
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,560
I'm sure he'll be more careful

772
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,600
and won't make a mistake easily again.

773
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,840
Putting someone in the dark

774
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,160
could work both ways.

775
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,080
If he can hurt our Xu family,

776
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,280
he could also hurt the Ou family.

777
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,360
Since we know his existence,

778
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,160
we can turn the danger
into our opportunity.
