Are you willing to live
in the house in the countryside?

21
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,380
Why am I not?

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,220
Princess Danyang's going to give birth
to a baby for our family.

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,460
It's a happy thing.

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,740
I just need to go and stay
in the house in the countryside

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,780
for a few months.

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
I can just relax a bit there.

27
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,420
Seeing you so reasonable,

28
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,540
I'm not worried anymore.

Xiuyuan,

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,940
this is what Concubine Qiao needs.

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,860
They're of good quality

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,860
without any flaws.

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,580
Thank you.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,060
This is from Concubine Qiao.

39
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,620
Please thank her for me.

Where were

42
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,580
they bought?

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,940
Your Ladyship,

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,940
I'm servant from the Xishan Villa.
You can call me Mrs. Liu.

45
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,940
I'm here to specially take
you to the villa.

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,140
Those were stuff

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,620
that other concubines asked
me to bring here

48
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,860
from the storage room of the villa.

49
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,500
If that's the case,

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,860
then thank you.

51
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,820
No worries.

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,340
Everything is settled in the villa.

53
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Once the servants pack things up,

54
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,580
You can be on your way, Your Ladyship.

55
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,060
Your Ladyship,

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,220
Mrs. Liu is really...

57
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,500
Never mind.

58
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,180
After all,

59
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,660
she's the maidservant in charge of
the Xishan Villa.

60
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,380
We don't know

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,100
how long we'll have to stay there.

62
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,020
Though we offered

63
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,380
to go there,

64
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,460
I just feel a little upset.

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,660
Why do you feel that?

66
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,300
I'm not sure.

67
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,300
It's just

68
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
that I'm anxious

69
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,300
about us leaving here.

70
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,740
If we stay,

71
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,180
we'll have to deal with
various people here.

72
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,140
Once we go to the villa,

73
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,500
we can sit back and relax a little.

74
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,700
Don't worry too much.

75
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,180
Let's go!

Nanny Tao!

80
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,620
It's such a big matter.

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,420
How could you agree to that?

82
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,340
It concerns the bloodline
of the Xu Family.

83
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,180
There's no reason

84
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,460
that I should disagree with it.

85
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,380
Right.

86
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,780
What you said is reasonable.

87
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,100
But you're already having a hard life

88
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,260
in the family.

89
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,860
You can only come back in several months

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,620
once you go to the villa.

91
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm afraid at that time

92
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,660
there won't be any chance

93
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,900
for you to survive here.

94
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,460
It's just a few months.

95
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,140
Don't worry, Nanny Tao.

96
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,420
OK.

97
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,900
I wish I worried too much.

98
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,260
Things have come to this far.

99
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,060
There's no other way out.

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,860
Your Ladyship!

101
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,180
The villa is different from here.

102
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,460
Please do take care of yourself.

103
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,380
Don't worry, Nanny Tao.

104
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,220
Dongqing and Amber are
still staying with me.

105
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,180
Please take care

106
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,740
of Zhun.

107
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,500
Please rest assured.

108
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,540
It's my job

109
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,140
to take care of Zhun.

110
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,820
Your Ladyship, wish you a safe journey!

I'll take care of you

while you're

116
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,780
in the villa.

117
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,620
Thank you, Mrs. Liu!

118
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,100
This way, please!

119
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,420

120
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,220
Your Ladyship!

121
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,060
Here's your room.

122
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,740
If you need anything else,

123
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,100
just tell me.

124
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,420
It's really clean and tidy here.

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
Thank you!

126
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,100
You're welcome.

127
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,260
We just did our job.

128
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,460
You can go on with your own business.

129
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,420
Amber.

130
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,540
Thank you for your hard work, Mrs. Liu.

131
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,060
Her Ladyship is a little tired.

132
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,780
You may leave here.

133
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,660
OK.

134
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,540
I'm going to leave.

135
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,660
Amber.

136
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,540
Why didn't you award

137
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,500
Mrs. Liu with any money?

138
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,260
She has done

139
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,260
a good job.

140
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,420
What you have done might make

141
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,740
Her Ladyship a laughingstock!

142
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,540
Your Ladyship,
we don't have any money left!

143
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,660
Why was it used up so soon?

144
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,420
Her Ladyship only gets a little money
every month!

145
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,740
It's almost at the end of the month.

146
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,140
We've almost used it up.

147
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,220
Not to mention awarding the servants,

148
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,100
we don't even have any money

149
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,340
to buy something new.

150
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,260
It's lovely.

151
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,020
What a lovely puppy!

152
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,260
Zhun, Yu.

153
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,180
Is this puppy lovely?

154
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,020
Zhun, do you want to touch it?

155
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,540
Zhun!

156
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,780
Zhun! Where are you?

157
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,580
Zhun, Nanny Tao is calling you.

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,700
If you want to play with the puppy,

159
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,460
come to me, OK?

160
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,900
But Nanny Tao may not
allow you to do that.

161
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,500
So

162
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,420
don't tell her, OK?

163
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,380
OK.

164
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,580
Just go!

165
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,700
This is too many.

166
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,980
How can we find it?

167
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,900
It's the only clue

168
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,700
that we have now.

169
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,140
We can only try our best.

170
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,900
There's no other way.

171
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,260
Just look for it.

172
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,980
Your Ladyship!

173
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,620
Amber.

174
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,300
What can I do

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,940
for you?

176
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,860
Then I'll leave.

177
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,300
If there's anything you need,

178
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,900
tell me please.

179
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,420
Amber.

180
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,220
I do need your help

181
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,740
for what I'm doing now.

182
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,380
But only the three of us

183
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,540
can know it.

184
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,020
There can't be a fourth
person to know it.

185
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,260
Can you keep it a secret?

186
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,260
Your Ladyship, can you trust me?

187
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,580
If you dare promise, I dare trust you.

188
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,340
Then I won't

189
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,180
let you down.

190
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,460
News from the Xishan Villa says

191
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,340
that Her Ladyship

192
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,460
has been looking for rags
in the storage room all day long,

193
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,620
claiming to make His Lordship a screen.

194
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,300
To displease His Lordship

195
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,620
with old-fashioned things.

196
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,660
She surely is a woman
that hasn't seen the world.

197
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,140
It's so funny.

198
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,220
Even such a vulgar woman

199
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,100
can trample on me.

200
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,260
Don't worry, Madam.

201
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,260
She's only the daughter of a concubine.

202
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,660
I don't think she can
get the upper hand for long.

203
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,420
Let's just wait and see.

204
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,660
Madam,

205
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,140
Great Madam asked you to come over.

206
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,020
Zhun is sick.

207
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,020
Don't worry, Zhun.

208
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,580
The medicine will be sent over soon.

209
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,980
Zhun.

210
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,820
Zhun, don't scratch it.

211
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,740
It may get worse.

212
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,180
-Don't scratch it.
-Don't worry.

213
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,780
Great Madam.

214
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,860
Look.

215
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,980
It's itchy.

216
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,500
-What's wrong with Zhun?
-Don't cry.

217
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,620
Why has he got so many rashes?

218
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,660
It looks worrying.

219
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,260
Have the servants sent
for the physician?

220
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,100
The physician has come,

221
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,100
saying he's got psoriasis or something.

222
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,420
-He's prescribed some medicine.
-It's itchy!

223
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,260
Itchy!

224
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,460
Don't scratch it. Don't scratch it. Zhun

225
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,220
Here's the medicine.

226
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,260
-Be quick. Be quick.
-Here. Here.

227
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,780
Here's the medicine.

228
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,700
Here's the herb soup.

229
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,740
-Don't cry.
-Here. Here.

230
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,940
Zhun, drink the herb soup.

231
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,540
Listen to me.

232
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,380
Drink the herb...

233
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,780
Why don't you drink?

234
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,500
-That won't do.
-It's itchy!

235
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,700
Drink some.

236
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,100
Great Madam,

237
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,540
how about letting me have a try?

238
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,260
It's a trivial matter.

239
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,340
Madam, please save your efforts.

240
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,540
Let me do it.

241
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,860
You don't have to.

242
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,500
I just want to ask you,

243
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,460
Nanny Tao.

244
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,260
You've been taking care of Zhun.

245
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,540
He's been well.

246
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,580
How come he's become

247
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,780
so sick?

248
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,740
Madam,

249
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,980
you can't take these words lightly.

250
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,740
Great Madam, you know about me.

251
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,620
To the Xu Family

252
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,340
and Zhun

253
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,900
I've been loyal.

254
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,300
Great Madam,

255
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,420
you must believe me.

256
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,100
Nanny Tao,

257
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,380
you've been working in the
Xu Family for long.

258
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,460
How can I not trust you?

259
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,940
But you're getting old.

260
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,980
It's understandable that you
may be careless sometimes.

261
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,740
You may help Lianfang take care of Zhun.

262
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,100
It's itchy!

263
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:48,940
Yes.

264
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,580
Great Madam.

265
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,660
It's itchy!

266
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,100
Don't cry. Don't cry.

267
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,820
-Be a good boy.
-Don't cry.

268
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,100
It's itchy!

269
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,820
Great Madam,

270
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,340
how about you go back and take a rest?

271
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,740
I'm here to take care of Zhun.

272
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,940
Don't worry.

273
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,580
Thanks for your work afterward.

274
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,740
Take good care of him.

275
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,460
OK.

276
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,460
Here.

277
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,020
Easy.

278
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,620
It's itchy!

279
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,060
You've heard

280
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,060
what Great Madam said.

281
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,740
From now on,

282
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,420
you don't have to take care of Zhun.

283
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,700
-Nanny Tao.
-Madam.

284
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,380
Please.

285
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,700
Zhun.

286
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,300
Nanny Tao,

287
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,900
please.

288
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,740
It's itchy! It's itchy!

289
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,300
Zhun.

290
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,300
Zhun feels itchy.

291
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,580
Here. Be a good boy.

292
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,420
Don't cry.

293
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,980
Drink the medicine.

294
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,380
It's itchy!

295
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,260
Here.

296
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,860
I don't drink it.

297
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,180
Xiuyuan, hold him tight.

298
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Don't let him move.

299
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,140
Zhun.

300
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,020
-It's itchy! I don't drink it.
-Be a good boy.

301
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
-Be good.
-I don't drink it.

302
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,940
Don't cry. Don't cry.

303
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,580
You're a good boy.

304
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,660
Don't move.

305
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,700
It's good for you to drink the medicine.

306
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,460
I don't drink it.

307
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,100
-It's itchy!
-Here.

308
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,420
Hold him tight.

309
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:11,860
OK.

310
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,420
Nanny Tao, what shall we do?

311
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,060
Zhun is so little.

312
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,740
He has to suffer this.

313
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,700
How can he stand it?

314
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,580
Her Ladyship is away.

315
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,420
Since Her Ladyship

316
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,980
married into the family,

317
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,340
she hasn't taken care of Zhun at all.

318
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,660
That was fine.

319
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,820
Now

320
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,580
she even decided by herself

321
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,100
to go to the Xishan Villa.

322
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,660
Now only Qiao Lianfang is here.

323
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,380
Zhun is pitiful.

324
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,340
He's so little

325
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,300
but he has to suffer this.

326
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,300
It's all Her Ladyship's fault!

327
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,780
Could I have got it wrong?

328
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,820
Your Ladyship!

329
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,580
We've been looking for it
for quite a few days

330
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,020
but we found no clues.

331
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,700
Mrs. Liu is suspicious now.

332
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,100
She's asked me several times.

333
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,300
Don't mind her.

334
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,380
We'll keep looking for it.

335
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,340
That doesn't matter.

336
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,620
Your Ladyship, look at this!

337
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,060
It seems to be the one I am looking for.

338
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,420
The weaving method and texture
resemble it very much.

339
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,060
But I'm not sure

340
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,620
if it's the piece of fabric
that we're looking for.

341
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,300
How about we go

342
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,500
and ask Master Jian?

343
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,420
Your Ladyship!

344
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,420
While you're out,

345
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,740
take the two of them with you.

346
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,820
They may look after you
if anything happens.

347
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,940
Thank you, Mrs. Liu.

348
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,860
I'll be back soon once
I've got things done.

349
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,220
(Xianling Pavilion)

350
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,540
Though,
this is a ragged piece of fabric.

351
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,380
They really are

352
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
of the same kind.

353
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,540
I've finally found it.

354
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,420
Then

355
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,900
I'll just need to check

356
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,620
who's used this kind of fabric

357
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,820
and screen them one by one.

358
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,420
We'll find the killer sooner or later.

359
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,740
Shiyi.

360
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,700
Look at this.

361
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,060
It's aromatic.

362
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,420
One of the customers

363
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,820
gifted me this rose perfume.

364
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,140
It's good to wear it.

365
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,820
How about you have a try?

366
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,260
If you like it,

367
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,340
bring it back with you.

368
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,460
Are you doing well in the Xu Family?

369
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,780
Are you getting along well
with the women there?

370
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,100
We're bullied.

371
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,380
I've never heard of any family

372
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,580
getting their matron to live in a villa

373
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,380
just for some taboo.

374
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,700
Stop talking nonsense.

375
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,820
The Xu Family is wealthy and powerful.

376
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,540
It's natural that they have more rules.

377
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,820
I just

378
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,820
didn't expect

379
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,060
that I hadn't found anything
in the mansion

380
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,020
but found a clue in the villa.

381
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,780
Even if that's the case,

382
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,780
you shouldn't have paid no attention

383
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,020
to anything else.

384
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,780
You should take good care of yourself.

385
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,940
I've heard Marquis is a man
of loyalty, bravery and integrity.

386
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,780
The Xu Family might be

387
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,460
a good family for you to marry into.

388
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,180
Teacher,

389
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,940
the Xu Family does enjoy

390
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,500
great wealth

391
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,660
and a high position.

392
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,820
But that's only the surface,

393
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,740
behind which one has

394
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,300
to make numerous compromises,
take numerous fights

395
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,020
and cheat each other to get all this.

396
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,620
That's not what I want.

397
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,180
It's just

398
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,220
that I can't stop worrying

399
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,420
about Zhun.

400
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,260
I don't care how you want to live
your life in the future.

401
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,540
As long as

402
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,740
you're the wife of Marquis Yongping,

403
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,580
you have to take responsibility

404
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,940
as the matron.

405
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
You can't do nothing about it.

406
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,980
Don't worry.

407
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,460
I know what to do.

408
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,340
Remember,

409
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,260
if you devote yourself to looking
for the killer

410
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,340
but pay no attention to your own life,

411
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,660
that's definitely not a life

412
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,100
that your mother expects to see.

413
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,300
(Xianling Pavilion)

414
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,420
Where are the guards?

415
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,900
Where's our carriage?

416
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,940
Since we've been staying
inside for long,

417
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,220
they may have gone and found a
place to rest a little.

418
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,660
Your Ladyship, you may wait here.

419
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,860
I'll go up ahead and look for them.

420
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,460
(Xianling Pavilion)

421
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,260
Where are they?

422
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,860
Ma'am.

423
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,180
Here.

424
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,380
How are you?

425
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,580
You aren't hurt, are you?

426
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,380
My ankle hurts.

427
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,140
I might have sprained it.

428
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,460
Dongqing,

429
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,740
let's take her to a clinic.

430
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,380
No, I don't need that.

431
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,500
I've just sprained it.
It doesn't matter.

432
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,340
It's just that my grandson

433
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,820
is waiting for me at home.

434
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,180
I have to hurry back.

435
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,380
But how can you go back

436
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
being like this?

437
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,500
How about you two

438
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,780
send me back?

439
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,180
It's not far.

440
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,980
Just past the turn ahead.

441
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,700
OK.

442
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,220
Thank...Thank you.

443
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
Take it easy.

444
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,660
Here. Easy.

445
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,060
Take care. Be careful.

446
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Thank you. Thank you.

447
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,700
Sorry.

448
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,700
(Xianling Pavilion)

449
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,780
Your Ladyship!

450
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,780
Your Ladyship!

451
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Dongqing!

452
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,620
Master Jian.

453
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,740
Amber.

454
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,340
What's wrong?

455
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,780
Master Jian,

456
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,700
have Her Ladyship and Dongqing

457
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,220
come back here?

458
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,220
No.

459
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,780
Weren't you together?

460
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,580
Our guards were gone.

461
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,020
Her Ladyship asked me to look for them,

462
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,540
but I wasn't able to find them.

463
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,900
When I came back, I found

464
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,100
Her Ladyship and Dongqing were
nowhere to be seen.

465
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
Both of them were gone?

466
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,820
She

467
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,580
isn't a careless person.

468
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,900
Could they have come

469
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,180
across something urgent?

470
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,300
That's why

471
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm worried.

472
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,700
Don't panic. Let me think.

473
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,500
It doesn't feel right.

474
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,660
What's happened is quite fishy.

475
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,060
I'm afraid

476
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,420
she was tricked.

477
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,300
Master Jian,

478
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,060
what should we do?

479
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,020
Don't worry.

480
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,900
Listen.

481
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,300
Shiyi disappeared for no reason.

482
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,940
If news spreads,

483
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,700
her reputation will be ruined.

484
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,700
Amber,

485
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,340
we need to be careful.

486
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,140
Understand?

487
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,140
Where's Her Ladyship?

488
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,380
You've even got the cheek to ask.

489
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,620
You didn't do your job well.

490
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,700
It was negligence.

491
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,620
When Her Ladyship was out,

492
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,220
neither of you were waiting upon her.

493
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,140
And the carriage

494
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,300
wasn't even seen.

495
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,140
That's how you did your job.

496
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,300
Amber,

497
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,420
we wanted to go to the toilet
badly just now.

498
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,660
Please forgive us.

499
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
The coachman didn't expect

500
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,060
Her Ladyship to go back so soon.

501
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,020
On his way here,

502
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,540
the road was too bumpy
and the wheels were damaged.

503
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,700
He has gone and got it fixed.

504
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,700
Where's Her Ladyship?

505
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,500
It's time for us to go back
to the villa.

506
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,020
Her Ladyship has got something to do

507
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,420
and gone back to the Luo Family.

508
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,500
She's left.

509
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,380
I'm here

510
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,420
to tell you the news.

511
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,420
Now that you know it,

512
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,820
you may go back to the villa now.

513
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,020
And I'm leaving here too.

514
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,940
We'll send you there.

515
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,500
Master Jian,

516
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,140
I'm taking my leave.

517
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,860
OK.

518
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,980
Come over.

519
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,580
Take care of the shop today.

520
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,580
I need to go out and do something.

521
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,340
Yes.

522
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,020
(Residence of Luo)

523
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
You may go back.

524
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,060
Her Ladyship will stay in the Luo Family

525
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,300
for a few days.

526
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,300
Servants here will escort her
when she goes back.

527
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,060
(Residence of Luo)

528
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,060
What are you doing?

529
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,460
Amber.

530
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,020
Let us get in and greet Her Ladyship

531
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
before we leave.

532
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,940
We left our positions on our own.

533
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,740
We'd like to make an apology in person

534
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,900
and take the blame.

535
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:27,940
Yes.

536
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,380
You don't have to.

537
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,220
I'll tell Her Ladyship you're sorry.

538
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,540
Please go back.

539
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,300
But we...

540
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,100
Watch your manners.

541
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,780
This is the Residence of Luo,

542
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,180
not the Xu Family's villa.

543
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,300
It's not the place where you can
go into as you wish.

544
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,740
Mr. Luo is His Lordship's father-in-law.

545
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,100
If he's disturbed,

546
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,740
we'll see if His Lordship
will skin you alive.

547
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,460
Let's go.

548
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,300
(Residence of Luo)

549
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,060
Madam, it's done.

550
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,220
Mrs. Liu

551
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,580
did a good job.

552
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,420
Don't worry.

553
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,860
Luo Shiyi

554
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,860
is doomed this time.

555
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,860
As long as she

556
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,380
stays overnight outside,

557
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,180
there's no way

558
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,460
she can make it clear

559
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,260
who's kidnapped her

560
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,700
and what happened during the night.

561
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,940
I asked you to stay with her

562
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,940
but now she's missing.

563
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,460
Madam, please forgive me.

564
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,860
It's all my fault.
I didn't do a good job.

565
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,740
Fine.

566
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,820
Save these words

567
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,380
until we find Shiyi.

568
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,660
Who else knows this matter

569
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,780
apart from you?

570
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,300
Only Master Jian of the
Xianling Pavilion

571
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,580
knows it.

572
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,300
But she'll never tell it to
a second person.

573
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,860
I told the guards

574
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,660
that Lady Shiyi,

575
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,660
would stay at home for a few days

576
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,980
and they believed it.

577
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,620
So the Xu Family and people
in the Xishan Villa

578
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,980
don't know about it yet.

579
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,740
Mother, don't worry.

580
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,420
Luckily Amber is smart.

581
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,940
There're a few days to go.

582
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,300
I'm taking people

583
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,460
to look for Shiyi.

584
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,140
Hurry up.

585
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Dead or alive,

586
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,100
bring her back.

587
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,140
Yes.

588
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,220
Your Ladyship.

589
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,100
Come.

590
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,020
I thought we could be free from worry

591
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,940
once we married Shiyi

592
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,500
into the Xu Family.

593
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,140
I didn't expect her

594
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
to be so useless.

595
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,340
Even if nothing serious happens,

596
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,420
once she's convicted of staying
overnight outside,

597
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,820
her reputation will be ruined.

598
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,500
Not to mention keeping her status
as the legal wife of Marquis Yongping,

599
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,660
our Luo Family

600
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,060
will be disgraced because of her.

601
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,340
How will Zhun get a foothold

602
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,780
in the Xu Family then?

603
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,180
My wife,

604
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,420
if there's no other way out,

605
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,140
let's report it to the government.

606
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,500
Mr. Luo, no.

607
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,340
We shouldn't do that.

608
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,340
Shiyi is a woman.

609
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,100
One night has almost passed,
but we haven't found her yet.

610
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
If we report it to the government,

611
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,460
the news of her missing

612
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,620
won't be kept as secret.

613
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,340
This will bring a bad effect to her.

614
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,260
Zhenxing.

615
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,740
Is there any news?

616
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,580
It's been 6-8 hours

617
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,300
since she was missing

618
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,700
and we haven't found any clues.

619
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,220
If we keep looking for her aimlessly

620
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,940
like this,

621
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,140
I'm afraid

622
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,180
something very bad will happen to Shiyi

623
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,540
before we find her.

624
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,860
Master Jian, do you have any clues?

625
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,420
As a woman,

626
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,060
if Shiyi is dead,

627
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,900
maybe she doesn't need to suffer much.

628
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,620
But if she's alive,

629
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,180
and if she isn't found
before the day breaks tomorrow,

630
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,060
she won't have a good life
in the Xu Family in the future.

631
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,700
I'm afraid

632
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,940
she would have a tough time.

633
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
How can that do?

634
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,100
If that's the case,

635
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,620
Zhun won't have anyone

636
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,180
to rely on in the Xu Family, will he?

637
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,460
Zhenxing,

638
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,940
hurry and come up with a solution.

639
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,500
I know what you mean.

640
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,260
But to me,

641
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,260
Shiyi's life

642
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,180
is more important than her reputation.

643
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,940
If the Xu Family wants to divorce her,

644
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,100
as her brother,

645
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,740
I'll support her for the
rest of her life.

646
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,100
If she's divorced,

647
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
the Luo Family will be

648
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,860
a laughingstock.

649
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,860
And you're going to support her
for the rest of her life?

650
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,420
Cut it out! Cut it out!

651
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,700
Stop talking that.

652
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,940
Mr. Luo, Madam Luo,

653
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,380
don't worry.

654
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,940
It's Shiyi's luck

655
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,340
to have such a brother

656
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,060
who cares her

657
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,500
so much.

658
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,420
I can understand

659
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,780
that the Young Master Luo is
eager to protect Shiyi.

660
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,700
But

661
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,500
I hope all of you

662
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,780
can listen to me.

663
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,660
Master Jian.

664
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,820
Just tell us what it is.

665
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,420
OK.

666
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Mr. Luo,

667
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
Shiyi was brought up
in the house of your family.

668
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,420
It's certain

669
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,660
that she doesn't have
any enemies out there.

670
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,020
If the kidnappers want money,

671
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,460
why don't they spread the news

672
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,220
to the Luo Family

673
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,900
or the Marquis Yongping's Mansion?

674
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,420
Right.

675
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,580
Their purpose is

676
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,300
to ruin Shiyi's reputation.

677
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,060
Yes.

678
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,460
That's what I'm worried about.

679
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,660
So if we report it to the government,

680
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,540
we might just fall for it.

681
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,180
But

682
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,860
we can hide it for now,

683
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,820
we can't hide it for long.

684
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,620
The news of Shiyi's missing

685
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,020
will be known sooner or later.

686
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,860
Now I've got an idea.

687
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,860
It might help.

688
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,620
Even if she's kidnapped,

689
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,700
her life

690
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,900
won't be threatened for now.

691
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,380
If she is still nowhere to
be found tomorrow,

692
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,380
it won't be too late to report
it to the government.

693
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,060
It seems that's the only way.

694
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,420
Zhun has been better these days.

695
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,140
My mind is at rest now.

696
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,060
Looking him suffer

697
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,340
kills me too.

698
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,940
Lianfang.

699
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,700
You're such a kind-hearted girl.

700
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,860
He's getting better,

701
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,620
thanks to you.

702
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,100
My Lord, you're back.

703
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,980
Greetings, Mother.

704
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,300
Look at you.

705
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,820
Why are you back

706
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,900
without telling us beforehand?

707
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,100
Why didn't you send someone

708
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,260
to tell us that

709
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,100
so that we can welcome you at the gate?

710
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,620
It's not my first time going out.

711
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,780
You don't have to welcome me.

712
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,140
Hurry and sit. Sit down.

713
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,980
Sit down.

714
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,540
Great Madam,

715
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,500
His Lordship had a good harvest
in this hunting.

716
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,380
He has especially brought back

717
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,580
the deer meat that you like.

718
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,380
Great Madam

719
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,540
can have a feast for your appetite.

720
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,540
Nice. Nice.

721
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,460
You're thoughtful.

722
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,260
My Lord, you must be tired.

723
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,620
Have a cup of tea and take a rest.

724
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,100
Why isn't Shiyi here?

725
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,460
Her Ladyship is...

726
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,580
What?

727
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,620
What's wrong?

728
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,820
I...

729
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,380
asked Shiyi

730
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,020
to move to the Xishan Villa.

731
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,460
Mother, is Danyang here?

732
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,780
You're back, brother.

733
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,460
I...

734
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,020
I just went

735
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,900
to buy pastries for Danyang.

736
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,180
They were just made in
the Deyue Restaurant.

737
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,140
I've also bought

738
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,460
Lotus Roots with Osmanthus flowers
and Honey in the Wangchun Restaurant.

739
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,220
Brother, do you want to have a try?

740
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,180
I've heard that Danyang
won't have a good life

741
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,180
if people born in the year
of ox at home.

742
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,300
So Shiyi

743
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,860
moved to the villa.

744
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,940
Yeah.

745
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,780
You and Danyang

746
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,940
only greet mother here in her residence.

747
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,260
I didn't expect

748
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,020
mother's servants and your servants

749
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,420
weren't enough to serve you.

750
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,820
All people born in the year of ox
had to go out of your way.

751
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,140
Do you know

752
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,260
how many people were born
in the year of ox in this family?

753
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,580
You made so big a fuss in the family

754
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,580
and nobody was able to
have a peaceful life.

755
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,380
You even followed

756
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,740
a Wizard's words.

757
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,700
If he's good at making predictions,

758
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,140
go and ask

759
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,180
how long he'll keep living for.

760
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,140
Just because of his words,

761
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,660
you even expelled my wife

762
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,780
out of the family.

763
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,620
Weren't you afraid you'd
become a laughingstock?

764
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,780
My Lord, please be calm.

765
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,100
This isn't Lingkuan's fault.

766
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,780
Danyang.

767
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,100
Don't cover him up every time.

768
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,500
Let him speak.

769
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,140
Mother, Danyang.

770
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Don't speak for me.

771
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,300
As for this matter,
I didn't consider it carefully.

772
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,380
I should take the blame.

773
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,260
I'm going to pick Shiyi

774
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,540
in the Xishan Villa.

775
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,380
Stop there!

776
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,060
Danyang's pregnant.

777
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,060
You don't go doing anything silly again.

778
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,540
Take her back and rest.

779
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,220
I'm going to pick Shiyi up.

780
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,700
Linbo. Let's go!

781
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,820
Don't worry, My Lord!

782
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,140
Her Ladyship isn't in the villa now.

783
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,420
Her Ladyship's in the Luo Family.

784
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,140
The Luo Family?

785
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,980
Mrs. Liu managing the Xishan Villa

786
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,020
replies

787
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,140
Her Ladyship wasn't used to
living in the villa,

788
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,660
so she went back to her parents' home.

789
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,460
After all,

790
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,260
this is my fault.
I didn't do a good job.

791
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,260
Can you let me

792
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
go to the Luo Family

793
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,660
and pick her up with you?

794
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,660
I hope this will comfort her.

795
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,700
Let's go.

796
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,860
Send someone to tell Mrs. Liu.

797
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,260
Let those two guards
report to the government,

798
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,740
asking the government to
send men to save her.

799
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,220
OK.

800
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,700
What's the matter?

801
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,140
Nothing.

802
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
I tell Xiuyuan to keep
some rules in mind.

803
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,460
How's it?

804
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,940
Is there any news about Shiyi?

805
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,860
We haven't found her.

806
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,220
The Young Master's still
looking for her.

807
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,580
This matter is quite fishy.

808
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,580
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship,

809
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Marquis Yongping is here.

810
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,020
What shall we do, Your Ladyship?

811
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,740
What else can we do?

812
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,500
We'll see what to do.

813
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,020
Father-in-law.

814
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,300
Mother-in-law.

815
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,580
Marquis,

816
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,340
you've always been busy with your work.

817
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,620
How come

818
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,820
you're here?

819
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,140
Marquis,

820
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,380
are you here to see Shiyi?

821
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,380
People in my family aren't reasonable.

822
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,100
I'm sorry that Shiyi is wronged.

823
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,860
I'm here to take her home.

824
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,900
You don't have to apologize.

825
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,460
Since she's your wife,

826
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,340
she should put you and your family

827
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,340
above all.

828
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,700
She isn't wronged at all.

829
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,340
But you didn't come at the right time.

830
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,260
She went out early in the morning.

831
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,740
Where's Her Ladyship gone?

832
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,460
Who's this...?

833
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,220
Madam, this is Concubine Qiao.

834
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,260
So you're Concubine Qiao.

835
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,100
My Lord.

836
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,540
Does the legal wife of Marquis Yongping

837
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,740
need to report to a concubine
before she does anything?

838
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,180
There wasn't such a rule before.

839
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,340
I'm sorry.

840
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,020
I didn't discipline her strictly.

841
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,980
My Lord,

842
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,980
I didn't mean to cross the line.

843
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,460
It's just I'm in charge of household
affairs in the family.

844
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,620
I'm worried about her.

845
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,980
Madam Luo isn't happy about me
asking about it.

846
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,820
Could it be

847
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,180
that you don't want to tell us

848
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
Her Ladyship's whereabouts?

849
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,100
What do you mean?

850
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,780
Marquis,
will you let a concubine do

851
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,820
whatever she wants in my house?

852
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,820
Make an apology.

853
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,140
My Lord, I...

854
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,420
I was just too worried and it
brought you trouble.

855
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,860
Please forgive me, Madam Luo.

856
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,500
Father-in-law.

857
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,860
Please tell me

858
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,940
where Shiyi is.

859
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,740
Here's the thing.

860
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,820
Last time Wuniang

861
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,060
found Shiyi's clothing was beautiful

862
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,580
when she came back home.

863
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,020
Shiyi wants to make a new one

864
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,460
and send it to her.

865
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,100
Now she's buying fabric with Dongqing

866
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,140
on the street.

867
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,820
I'm not sure when she'll be back.

868
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,820
How about this?

869
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,620
You've got work to do.

870
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,780
You may go on with your work.

871
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,500
Once Shiyi's back,

872
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,220
I'll have her sent back.

873
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,380
What do you think?

874
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,460
I'm not bothered.

875
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,060
I'm free today.

876
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,500
I'll just wait Shiyi here.

877
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,060
Please be seated.

878
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,660
I'll make you a cup of tea.

879
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,820
Please sit down.

880
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,220
Go and find the Young Master.

881
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,180
Tell him the Marquis

882
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:21,940
has come here to pick Lady Shiyi.

883
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,620
Tell him

884
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,500
to find her as soon as possible.

885
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,220
I will try to stall the
Marquis with Madam Luo

886
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,500
for as long as we can.

887
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:25,940
Yes.

888
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,460
Dongqing.

889
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,500
Dongqing.

890
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,700
Your Ladyship.

891
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,980
Where are we now?

892
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,420
What's going on?

893
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,020
Hey,

894
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,780
these two ladies

895
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,980
are beautiful.

896
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,780
How about we...?

897
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,780
Shut up!

898
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,820
Our superior has said
we can't hurt them.

899
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,660
Stop complaining.

900
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,740
I'm going to report to
the government now.

901
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,900
Once the job is done,

902
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,300
we'll get paid.

903
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,460
Keep watching them.

904
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,380
It looks like we were framed up.

905
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,180
Who wants to frame us up?

906
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,100
Only several people

907
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,820
might do this.

908
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,340
When the guards left

909
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,700
the Xianling Pavilion,

910
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,260
we started to walk into the trap.

911
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,420
Well...

912
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,060
What will they do?

913
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,980
Will they...?

914
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,820
-Will they...?
-Don't worry.

915
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,380
Those who got us here

916
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,700
won't do anything bad to us,

917
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,740
or they'd have done it earlier.

918
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,980
I'm worried

919
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,100
things will be more serious than that.

920
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,420
(Shuntian Prefecture Office)

921
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,740
What is it for that you're
striking the drum?

922
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,820
Sir, I've got things to report.

923
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,140
It's been long as we've drunk
four or five cups of tea.

924
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,980
Her Ladyship really is fastidious

925
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,940
when choosing a piece of fabric.

926
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,420
Marquis,
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting long.

927
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
How about we send a person

928
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,260
to look for her

929
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,460
in each cloth shop on the street?

930
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,500
Amber,
why didn't you go with Her Ladyship

931
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,140
when she went to buy fabric
on the street?

932
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,220
She asked me to do something else.

933
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,300
So I wasn't able to go with her.

934
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,860
My Lord, how about this?

935
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,300
I'll send someone to go
and look for her on the street.

936
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,060
He can carry things for her.

937
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,820
Moreover, he can tell her

938
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,100
you're waiting here

939
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,940
to take her home in person.

940
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,460
If you're still worried,

941
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,540
I'll send someone

942
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,380
to get Shiyi home.

943
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,660
How about this?

944
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,660
I'll send my deputy general to go
and look for Shiyi.

945
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,620
Linbo.

946
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,620
Hurry and go.

947
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,180
Yes, My Lord.

948
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,300
OK, we agree to that.

949
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,620
Dongqing, help me untie the rope.

950
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,900
Keep looking for Her Ladyship.

951
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,460
Yes.

952
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,060
(Vinegar)

953
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,620
General Fu.

954
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,740
Save the formalities.

955
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,180
I see you're in a hurry.

956
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,740
Is there an emergency?

957
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,860
Someone reported

958
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,220
he was hearing two ladies
calling for help

959
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,060
that they got kidnapped

960
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,100
in Liu'er Hutong in the
west of the city.

961
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,740
I'm going there to
investigate it especially.

962
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,540
How evil that is!

963
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,460
Hurry and go investigating it.

964
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,740
I won't disturb you anymore.

965
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,540
Yes.

966
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,220
Go.

967
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,220
Sir, hurry up.

968
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:40,140
(Buddha's Bliss Goes To All)

969
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,420
Sir, this is the place.

970
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,060
Someone reported just now

971
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,780
that some ladies of the Luo Family
were kidnapped,

972
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,580
but we haven't received any report

973
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,740
from the Luo Family.

974
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,860
So we're here to ask

975
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,020
if there's anyone missing
in your family.

976
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,060
We don't have anyone
missing in our family.

977
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,340
If that's the case,

978
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,900
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

979
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,060
My Lord,

980
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,700
there's one thing.

981
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,580
I'm not sure if I should say it.

982
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,740
What is it?

983
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,220
Yesterday

984
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,580
the guards escorting Her Ladyship

985
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,900
went back to the Xishan Villa.

986
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,100
Hearing that Her Ladyship wanted

987
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,220
to come back and live for a few days,

988
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,580
Mrs. Liu sent two guards

989
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,220
to wait upon her near the Luo Family

990
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,100
so they could protect her.

991
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,300
Madam Luo said earlier

992
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,540
that Her Ladyship had gone to buy fabric

993
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,860
early in the morning.

994
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,220
But

995
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,100
I just sent Xiuyuan

996
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,180
to ask the guards.

997
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,620
The guards said

998
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,220
they haven't seen Her Ladyship
went out of the house.

00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,740

00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,660
