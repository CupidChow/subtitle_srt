=The Sword and the Brocade=

18
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,420
=Episode 28=

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,200
You donated so much money

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,920
just for this amulet.

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,560
I even think it's too much.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,280
It'll work better when you donate more.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm sure

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,440
this amulet will make Yu

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,720
safe and happy.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,000
Yu is lucky

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,000
to have a loving mother

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,520
like you.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
Shiliu,

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,840
you are childless,
so you don't understand.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,320
A child

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
is everything to his mother.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,720
Whenever I think about

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,800
Yu,

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,800
I'd feel my life is full of hope.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,560
Otherwise, we live in the back yard

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,720
and we seldom see His Lordship...

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,160
Shiliu,

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
I wasn't talking about you.

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Please don't take it personally.

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,080
It's okay.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,120
I know

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,560
you are a straightforward person.

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,320
I won't take it personally.

45
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,940
(Xianling Pavilion)

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,200
Come and take a look.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
We'll pass by Xianling Pavilion soon.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,880
Maybe Her Ladyship is also there.

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,480
Shall we go there

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,520
and check if there's any trendy fabric

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,760
so that we can make new clothes?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But is it okay to go back home late?

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,000
We'll go there

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
and come back together
with Her Ladyship.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
Great Madam won't blame us.

56
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,920
Come on.

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,480
The fabric, embroidery pattern

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,680
and stitches of this silk handkerchief

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,920
are exactly the same

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,960
as this piece of fabric

61
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,280
you kept.

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,440
Where did you

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,960
get this piece of silk?

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,920
I found it

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,960
from His Lordship's eldest son.

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,920
When

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,680
we checked

68
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
the records of the inventory,

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Concubine Wen did asked

70
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
for this type of fabric before.

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,960
It's a match.

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
But people always say that
Marquis Yongping

73
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,880
is a righteous person.

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,480
Why would he kill innocent people?

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,960
That's right.

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,160
Even though what the coroner
and the hunter said

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,240
and this embroidery
directly point to him,

78
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,360
it's only collateral evidence.

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
We can't make

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
an arbitrary decision
that it's Marquis

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,960
who killed your mother just with this.

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,200
When he was drunk,

83
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
I asked him.

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,960
He said it was his fault

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
that my mother died.

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,360
But I still don't want to believe it.

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I heard

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
the embroidery here

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,560
is the best in the capital.

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,200
I heard the same.

91
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,680
Madams,

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,000
what kind of embroidery do you want?

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
If we don't have it on display,

94
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,280
we can make customized products

95
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
for you.

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
Is Her Lady...

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
I mean, is Master Luo here?

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Master Luo

99
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,000
is in the practice room right now.

100
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,320
Over there?

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
Yes. Please.

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,760
Thank you.

103
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,680
I don't believe His Lordship

104
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,160
would do such thing either.

105
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,320
Could it be

106
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,680
a misunderstanding?

107
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,440
I also hope it's a misunderstanding.

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,040
But the evidence is right here.

109
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,400
I...

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,040
If

111
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
it's all true,

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
then I...

113
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,000
I know you feel sad.

114
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,240
But it's not your fault.

115
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,800
It should be here.

116
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,640
This...

117
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,640
Wait.

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,160
This...

119
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
Didn't... Didn't you see that? That...

120
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,580
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Her Ladyship is not here?

122
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,000
My Lord.

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,960
Did Shiyi go
to Xianling Pavilion?

124
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,880
Her Ladyship didn't say.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,520
She went out early in the morning.

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,120
What's with the lanterns?

127
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,320
My Lord,

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Her Ladyship asked people

129
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
to take them down.

130
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
Why did you stop me?

131
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
Why can't we just confront Her Ladyship?

132
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,320
Lower your voice.

133
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
I can tell right away

134
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,640
that the man is Her Ladyship's lover.

135
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
Didn't you see that?

136
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,240
They were so close.

137
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,680
I was almost scared to death.

138
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,440
I don't think so.

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,880
Her Ladyship isn't that type of person.

140
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
She wouldn't do such thing

141
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,560
behind His Lordship's back.

142
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,800
Don't do anything recklessly

143
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,000
before you find out the truth.

144
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
You'd be in trouble if you caused chaos.

145
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,600
Then what kind of person she is?

146
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,880
She goes to Xianling Pavilion every day.

147
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Is it really just for
teaching embroidery?

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,280
My Lord.

149
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh, no.

150
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,840
I was talking loud.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
Did His Lordship hear me?

152
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm sure he did.

153
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,920
He must be

154
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,520
on his way to Xianling Pavilion now.

155
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,960
It's bad. It's so bad.

156
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,520
Would he get mad at me

157
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
because of what I said?

158
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,520
He doesn't have time

159
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
to be mad at you right now.

160
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,840
Hope nothing will happen
to Xianling Pavilion.

161
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,440
Let's go and take a look.

162
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,720
Come on. Let's go.

163
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,680
But...

164
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,440
If your mother was really
killed by His Lordship,

165
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,320
what should we do?

166
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,960
The details still remain unclear.

167
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,000
We'd better investigate it carefully.

168
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,120
Then how should we investigate it?

169
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,720
Let me take a walk first.

170
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,920
Be careful.

171
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,520
Shiyi.

172
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,240
Go home with me.

173
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,560
Go home with me.

174
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,480
You need to ask for her opinion first.

175
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,320
Who are you?

176
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm Shiyi's friend.

177
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,240
If she doesn't want to go,

178
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,520
you can't force her to.

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,720
My Lord,

180
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,840
I just remembered.

181
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,800
He's Ou Yanxing,
the second son of the Ou family.

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,920
What's your purpose

183
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
of approaching my wife?

184
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,200
Has your Ou family become

185
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
shameless like this?

186
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,240
There's nothing between Shiyi and me.

187
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
How dare you call her Shiyi?

188
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,240
My Lord.

189
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,560
Mr. Ou isn't the type of person

190
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,640
you think he is.

191
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
Mr. Ou?

192
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,520
So you knew that
he's one of the Ou family

193
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,760
and you were still seeing him?

194
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,560
Stop fighting.

195
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,800
Xu Lingyi.

196
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,800
Shiyi.

197
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,080
It's dangerous. Put down the scissors.

198
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,960
You really don't care about
people's lives?

199
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,240
You are actually threatening me

200
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,040
with your own life for him?

201
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,120
Put down the scissors.

202
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,440
Put down the sword.

203
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,400
My Lord.

204
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,880
My Lord.

205
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,360
My Lord.

206
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,880
Your Ladyship. What have you done?

207
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,360
My Lord.

208
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,040
Linbo.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,920
Let's go.

210
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,560
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,880
My Lord.

212
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,280
Oh, gosh.

213
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,600
How did you get hurt?

214
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
-A lot of blood.
-My Lord.

215
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,800
Take His Lordship back.

216
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,480
Your Ladyship, is it you?

217
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
Is it you who stabbed His Lordship?

218
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
Why did you do that?

219
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,480
Just say someone tried to assassinate
me outside of the capital.

220
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,160
What happened here today

221
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,000
must be kept a secret.

222
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,200
Otherwise, you'll

223
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,240
all be expelled from the Xu family.

224
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,600
Let's go.

225
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,960
His Lordship still needs to
go to Shandong in a couple of days.

226
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,240
Stop talking.

227
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,800
Let's go.

228
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,440
My Lord.

229
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,520
Great Madam.

230
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
What happened?

231
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,560
Tell me.

232
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,400
We

233
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
encountered assassins
outside of the capital.

234
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,280
Assassins?

235
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,160
You are his Vice General.

236
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,880
How did you fail in protecting him?

237
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, no.

238
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,480
It's a lot of blood.

239
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,640
How badly he must have wounded.

240
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,520
Mother.

241
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,160
We have to report this.

242
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,840
According to the imperial edict,

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,720
His Lordship will have to
leave for Shandong in three days.

244
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
If we don't report this accident,

245
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
and he can't leave in three days,

246
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,040
he'll be punished
for defying the imperial edict.

247
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,360
That makes sense.

248
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,880
Kuan'er, go, now.

249
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Yes, Mother.

250
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Don't go.

251
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,160
Do not report this.

252
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
The wound is quite deep.

253
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,240
Lingyi.

254
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,120
Mother.

255
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
How did...

256
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,800
How did you get hurt?

257
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,200
Tell me.

258
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Why can't we report this?

259
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,120
With your condition,

260
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,040
how can you go to Shandong?

261
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
If we don't report this,

262
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,800
how can we explain to His Majesty?

263
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,560
Defying the imperial edict

264
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,560
is a capital offense.

265
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,640
Lingyi,

266
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,160
you'll get yourself killed.

267
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,520
I have my reasons.

268
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,880
Do as I say.

269
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,400
Mother,

270
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,840
promise me.

271
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,520
Alright.

272
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,040
I'll listen to you.

273
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,840
I promise.

274
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,520
Physician, please
treat Lingyi carefully.

275
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,440
His Lordship needs rest.

276
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,520
Everybody,

277
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,440
please leave and let him rest.

278
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,880
Okay.

279
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,240
Lingyi needs rest.

280
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,360
Let's go back.

281
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,080
This thing is quite strange.

282
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,320
Lingyi wouldn't tell me the truth.

283
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,840
But I know he's hiding
something from me.

284
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,160
Now, get someone

285
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,640
to investigate this thing

286
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,440
and find out what happened exactly.

287
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Yes.

288
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,600
His Lordship

289
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,280
bled a lot.

290
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,640
Would he...

291
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,280
Look how timid you are.

292
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,720
Nothing even happened yet.

293
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,480
His Lordship is a war veteran.

294
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,960
He has been hurt much worse than this

295
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,160
for so many times.

296
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm sure

297
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,160
he'll be fine.

298
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,160
But I didn't expect

299
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
that he'd so desperately

300
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,480
protect that Luo...

301
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,680
Protect Her Ladyship.

302
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,400
Maybe

303
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,440
we should

304
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,760
tell Great Madam

305
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,240
how His Lordship got hurt exactly.

306
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,160
Otherwise, I won't feel at ease

307
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,560
keeping a secret like this.

308
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,590
We already deliberately

309
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,680
kept it from Great Madam

310
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,310
since we didn't tell her earlier.

311
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,830
If you told her now,

312
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,200
she wouldn't appreciate it,

313
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,720
and we'd offend His Lordship.

314
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,280
I'd rather keep it a secret all the way

315
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,960
then be hesitant about it.

316
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,800
Also,

317
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,200
do not

318
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,720
tell anybody about

319
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,720
that man and Her Ladyship.

320
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,120
His Lordship knew it already.

321
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
If he doesn't say anything,

322
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,360
we should pretend

323
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,720
that we know nothing.

324
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,800
Yes.

325
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Do you remember what I said?

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
Yes.

327
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,120
And you also need to keep it a secret.

328
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,200
I won't tell. I won't.

329
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,840
Your Ladyship.

330
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,080
I don't think you should go in there

331
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,800
before His Lordship wakes up.

332
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,640
What do you know?

333
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,040
It's not like what you think.

334
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,120
His Lordship was...

335
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,800
General Fu,

336
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,520
I didn't hurt His Lordship on purpose.

337
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,600
And now, I just hope

338
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,240
he can recover soon.

339
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,200
If you are worried,

340
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,560
you can guard him and

341
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,080
take care of him together with me.

342
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,280
General Fu,

343
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
His Lordship needs someone

344
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,640
to take care of him.

345
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,600
If you don't allow Her Ladyship
to look after him,

346
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
others will be suspicious,

347
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,200
which isn't something

348
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,560
His Lordship would hope for.

349
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,120
Just say someone tried to assassinate
me outside of the capital.

350
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,720
What happened here today

351
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,480
must be kept a secret.

352
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,640
Otherwise, you'll

353
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,800
all be expelled from the Xu family.

354
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,680
Don't go.

355
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
Do not report this.

356
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,200
Your Ladyship, you haven't had

357
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,520
anything since you got back.

358
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,160
General Fu and Zhaoying

359
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,760
are taking care of
His Lordship right now.

360
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,520
You should eat something first.

361
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,680
Your Ladyship, you didn't do it
on purpose anyway.

362
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,920
I'm afraid I wronged His Lordship.

363
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,000
What made you say that, Your Ladyship?

364
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,040
His Lordship asked them not to tell

365
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,480
it's me who hurt him,

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,120
and he asked Mother not to report this.

367
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,880
He's hurt because of me.

368
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,760
But even when his life was in danger,

369
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,400
he still tried so hard to protect me.

370
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
How could

371
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,320
such a person kill innocent people?

372
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,400
Come to think of it,

373
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,480
all the evidence

374
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,760
came together too quickly.

375
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,760
First the coroner appeared,
then the hunter,

376
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,520
and that arrow...

377
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,040
They all led me

378
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,960
to suspect His Lordship.

379
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,840
So what should we do now?

380
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,200
At the moment,
His Lordship's safety matters the most.

381
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
Let's wait till His Lordship

382
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,840
wakes up.

383
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Your Ladyship,

384
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
this medicine has to be
taken six times a day,

385
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,000
and one time for each hour,

386
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,280
which must be strictly followed.

387
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Someone needs to be around all day long.

388
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,680
I'm worried that you'll get tired.

389
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
Why don't you go back?

390
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
Zhaoying and I will
take care of His Lordship.

391
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,320
Don't worry.

392
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,360
I will help him
take the medicine on time.

393
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,200
If you are still worried,

394
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,640
you can stay here and watch.

395
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,200
My Lord,

396
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,280
as long as you can wake up,

397
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm willing to
take all the responsibility.

398
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,360
What are you doing?

399
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,440
General Fu, I slipped.

400
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,480
I didn't do it on purpose.

401
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
You slipped?

402
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,560
You think I'm blind?

403
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,160
I saw that.

404
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,360
You did that on purpose.

405
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,880
Yes, I did.

406
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
But things usually happen for a reason.

407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
If you ask people first

408
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,680
why they do that,

409
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,480
you may not think

410
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,560
it's too much.

411
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,200
You are such a sharp-tongued

412
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,080
and unreasonable girl.

413
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,760
How could it make you right
when you sprayed water on me?

414
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,720
Right or not,
we'll find out after argument.

415
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,840
It's way better than making

416
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,280
a groundless judgment like you did.

417
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
You are so disrespectful.

418
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,880
Come back.

419
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,940
(Xianling Pavilion)

420
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,720
Master Jian,

421
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,280
any news about Shiyi?

422
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
Shiyi asked a maid

423
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,280
to send a message.

424
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,960
His Lordship is still in a coma,

425
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
but he's out of danger now.

426
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,280
That's good.

427
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,560
Otherwise, it'd be more difficult

428
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,160
for Shiyi to survive in Xu family.

429
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,680
That's right.

430
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,440
As long as His Lordship is there,

431
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,080
no one would dare

432
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
hurt Shiyi.

433
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,800
He even tried to protect her

434
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,240
when he was badly injured.

435
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm sure he won't

436
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,360
hurt her after he wakes up.

437
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,040
Your Ladyship,

438
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,000
you haven't slept for two nights.

439
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,720
You should go back and take a rest.

440
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
We'll stay here.

441
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,800
If His Lordship wakes up,

442
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,480
we'll let you know right away.

443
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,480
Your Ladyship,

444
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,800
the physician said

445
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,640
His Lordship will get better.

446
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,320
Don't worry.

447
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,400
My Lord.

448
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
My Lord. You wake up.

449
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Amber, go get the physician.

450
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,640
Yes.

451
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,120
My Lord.

452
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,800
My Lord.

453
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,080
How long have I been out?

454
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,840
My Lord,

455
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,800
you slept for two days.

456
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,360
Help me to pack.

457
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,600
We need to leave for Shandong.

458
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,680
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

459
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Mother.

460
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,320
Yi'er,

461
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,840
just stay at home and get better.

462
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,200
I'll let Linbo

463
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,760
report your situation to the court,

464
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,160
and ask Shuntian Prefecture Office
to investigate it.

465
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,120
I've got to find out

466
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,640
who actually dared

467
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,640
assassinate a high-ranking official

468
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
right in the capital.

469
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,040
Sorry, Mother,

470
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,320
for making you worried.

471
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,760
But I'm the only one

472
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,000
who can take care of
the disaster relief.

473
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,160
How can you go there

474
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,240
when you are injured like this?

475
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,600
Then tell me

476
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,400
who stabbed you?

477
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,840
Mother,

478
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,840
it's...

479
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,440
Mother.

480
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,440
I suspect that Ou family

481
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,160
is taking advantage of
the disaster relief

482
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,200
and embezzling the relief funds.

483
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,000
Otherwise,

484
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,240
why would Ou Lixing, the Vice Minister

485
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
of Ministry of Rites, volunteer to do

486
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,640
the Ministry of Revenue's job?

487
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,680
Perhaps the Ou family

488
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,120
even had something to do
with the assassination,

489
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,440
so that they can make me stay.

490
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,280
If we investigate it right now,

491
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,400
we'll fall right into their plan.

492
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,480
And if Ou Lixing

493
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,160
has me replaced,

494
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,400
the people will suffer even more.

495
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,600
Therefore,

496
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
we can't take any impulsive action.

497
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,480
In that case,

498
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,600
I'm worried about you even more.

499
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,000
You are seriously injured.

500
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,160
If Ou family...

501
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,920
But if I put my personal safety

502
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,920
before the court and the people,

503
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,360
our Xu family will

504
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,480
be nothing different from the Ou family.

505
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
For our country and our family,

506
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
I have to go this time.

507
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,160
But with your condition...

508
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,400
The injury is no big deal.

509
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,120
I'll be well soon with the physician

510
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,320
treating me on the way.

511
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,640
Alright.

512
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,280
Take good care of His Lordship.

513
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,200
Yes, Mother.

514
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,120
My Lord, it's time to take medicine.

515
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
(I, Xu Lingyi, Marquis Yongping,)

516
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,480
(married Luo Shiyi.)

517
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,080
(However, the marriage arrangement
wasn't my intention.)

518
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,000
(So there's no affection)

519
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,720
(between my wife and me.)

520
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,520
(We both still have a way
to go in life.)

521
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,520
(To find peace)

522
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,760
(and avoid trouble,)

523
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,240
(I hereby write this Divorce Agreement)

524
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,080
(to free us from future hatred, grudge)

525
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,880
(and argument.)

526
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,720
(This Divorce Agreement)

527
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
(will serve as a proof of our divorce.)

528
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,700
(Divorce Agreement)

529
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,680
You are going to divorce me?

530
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
After I leave this time,

531
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
I don't know when I'll come back.

532
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,760
If Mother finds out what happened,

533
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,600
just show them this Divorce Agreement

534
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,960
and leave here.

535
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,360
They won't give you a hard time.

536
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,320
But

537
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
it was a careless mistake and I didn't

538
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,440
hurt you on purpose.

539
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I'm willing to accept

540
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,400
any punishment.

541
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,800
Don't divorce me.

542
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,640
And you don't have to cover it for me.

543
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Leave Xu family,

544
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,080
find someone you like and get married.

545
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,080
But you can't trust Ou Yanxing.

546
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,640
The people of the Ou family
are scheming and crafty.

547
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,480
They won't treat you with sincerity.

548
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,560
I've known Ou Yanxing

549
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,560
for two years.

550
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,600
Back then he used
the name, Lin Shixian.

551
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,680
I have just found out

552
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,160
who he really is recently.

553
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Even though he's one of the Ou family,

554
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,680
he doesn't get along with his family,

555
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,840
and he's not a crafty person.

556
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,360
To be honest,

557
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,160
over the past year,

558
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,600
I've been investigating
my mother's death.

559
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,320
Ou Yanxing has been helping me

560
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
with the investigation.

561
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,280
One day,

562
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,120
I met the coroner

563
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,840
who checked my mother's body.

564
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,120
He told me that my mother
died from an arrow shot.

565
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,600
And someone

566
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,080
found the arrow on that day,

567
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,480
which is exactly the same as

568
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,720
Xu family's three-edged arrow.

569
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,680
There is someone who witnessed

570
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,280
that you shot the hostage, my mother,

571
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,600
to death in order

572
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
to catch the fugitive.

573
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,280
Even if they claim that it's me

574
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,800
who shot your mother,

575
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,520
do you think

576
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,280
it's possible that I took away

577
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,400
the pirate's body

578
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,680
yet left the arrow behind?

579
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,040
How could you fall for

580
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,280
others' words so easily?

581
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,840
Am I just a villain

582
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,880
who kills

583
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,600
innocent people in your eyes?

584
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,600
Actually,

585
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,640
I didn't quite believe it

586
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,120
even all the evidence was there.

587
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,880
Until that day you were drunk,

588
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,360
you said it yourself

589
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,640
that you had something to do
with my mother's death,

590
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,560
which reminded me of
the first time when we met.

591
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,560
You also shot me

592
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,040
without hesitation

593
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,600
while pursuing a fugitive.

594
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,400
So...

595
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,760
So I couldn't help but suspect you.

596
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,360
What about my mother?

597
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,040
How did my mother die?

598
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,520
It was my fault.

599
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
It was my fault.

600
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,080
That day,

601
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,440
I thought

602
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,960
you felt for me.

603
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,200
Turns out

604
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,920
you were just testing me on purpose.

605
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm sorry.

606
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,600
I feel sorry

607
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,800
for your mother's death.

608
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,840
If I had been able to get there early,

609
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,560
I'm sure the tragedy

610
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,200
could've been avoided.

611
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,440
Fine.

612
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,040
I'll have Linbo call the people

613
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,840
who chased Liu Yong
together with me over

614
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,080
so that you can ask them yourself.

615
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,230
No. You don't need to.

616
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,920
If you chose to trust me

617
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,920
and be honest with me,

618
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,320
there wouldn't be any misunderstanding.

619
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,800
We've married for long.

620
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,480
I thought

621
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,560
we loved each other

622
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,040
and understood each other.

623
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,400
But it turns out

624
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
it was all my wishful thinking

625
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
and imagination.

626
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,120
In your eyes,

627
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,520
I'm even worse than
someone from the Ou family

628
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,560
who's done so much harm to our country.

629
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,600
My Lord,

630
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
everything's ready.

631
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,320
We can leave at any time.

632
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,920
Don't go.

633
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,600
It's a long and difficult journey.

634
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
It won't be good for your recovery.

635
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,120
Don't go.

636
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,080
Take care.

that His Lordship

736
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,800
took the risk for her.

739
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,760
and making His Lordship worriless

740
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,680
can she make it up for him.

741
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,520
I understand.

742
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,440
But Her Ladyship

743
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,040
has been working too hard.

00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,880

745
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,880

00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,240

748
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,560
the silk thread you want is here.

749
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,480
Your Ladyship,

750
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,120
are you going to do some

751
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,120
new embroidery with the silk thread?

752
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,600
I heard

753
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,640
that the portrait of Bodhisattva can
bless people with safety,

754
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,400
so I want to embroider
Bodhisattva's portrait

755
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,840
and pray for His Lordship.

756
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,120
Hope His Lordship

757
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,920
can come back safely soon.

00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,200

00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:38,760

00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,360
Thank you, My Lord.

767
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120

769
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,920
Okay. Thank you.

771
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,920
The refugees have

772
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,920
all been settled now.

773
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,920
The relief has also

774
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,160
been delivered.

775
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,120
It should be enough for the people.

776
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,040
Good.

777
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,280
My Lord,

778
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,920
you've been walking all day long.

779
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,600
The physician said

780
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,000
you need to take a good rest.

781
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,760
If you don't,

782
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,920
your condition will get worse.

783
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,160
It's the time

784
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:23,600
when the refugees

785
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,040
need us the most.

786
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
I can't take a rest.

787
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,600
Be careful.

788
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,160
Here.

789
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,960
My Lord.

790
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,280
My Lord.

791
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,240
Are you okay?

792
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,800
I'm fine.

793
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,920
Thank you, My Lord.

794
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,560
My Lord,

795
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,680
the wound is open again.

796
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,400
It hasn't got any better.

797
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,920
Instead, it's getting worse.

798
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,360
My Lord,

799
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,560
you must rest.

800
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,280
Otherwise,

801
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,120
your life will be in danger.

802
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,360
Compared to the refugees,

803
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,280
my wound is nothing.

804
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,800
Physician, please take care of it,

805
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,920
but don't ask me to rest again.

806
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,440
Disaster relief comes first.

807
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,760
Okay, My Lord.

808
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,160
Please hand in there.

809
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,120
I'll change the bandage for you.

810
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,800
P...Physician.

811
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,920
Please be gentle.

812
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,480
Okay, I will.

813
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,960
My Lord, are you

814
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,440
thinking about Her Ladyship again?

815
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,760
I don't know where she is right now.

816
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,960
If Mother finds out,

817
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:36,880
I'm afraid she won't

818
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,160
let Shiyi off easily.

819
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,760
My Lord, you've expected that.

820
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,560
That's why you left her
a Divorce Agreement

821
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,880
to protect her.

822
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,800
Actually,

823
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,080
you don't want

824
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,560
to divorce her at all.

825
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,920
Her safety matters the most.

826
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,680
If

827
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,200
she

828
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,360
really has to use the Divorce Agreement

829
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,240
one day,

830
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,600
that'll be Heaven's will

831
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,480
to part us.

832
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,960
My Lord,

833
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,040
the medicine is ready.

834
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,280
Please take it while it's warm.

835
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,120
Report.

836
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,880
Bad news. My Lord.

837
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,160
An inn nearby is on fire.

838
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,760
There are still people inside.

839
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,880
Hurry. Bring water.

-Hurry.

841

-Water.
-Help.

844

Water is here. Water is here.
