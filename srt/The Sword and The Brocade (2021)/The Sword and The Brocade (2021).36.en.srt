her furious

Yes, Your Ladyship.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
Given what you just said,

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
I think you've known

what I'm going to do.

I just thought

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
that when someone plays nice,

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,040
the other should use threats.

I think Your Ladyship

just wanted to provoke Lady Erniang.

58

I've always wanted

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,880
to apologize to you.

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,840
Because of me, you had to
withdraw from Xianling Pavilion.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,480
Sorry I caused you the trouble.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,320
Our business is getting busier.

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,320
I was going to quit anyway.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,160
Madam Xu, you don't have to feel

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,280
sorry for that.

66
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,640
By the way,

67
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,800
when I was at Xianling Pavilion

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,880
and checking the account
with Master Jian,

69
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,040
she told me

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,760
that you seldom went there lately.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Is there anything happened at home?

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,600
Nothing happened at home.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,960
It's just that Erniang...

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
Young Madam Wang?

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,320
I've also heard of it.

76
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,960
Speaking of that,

77
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,520
our Ou family
has something to do with it.

78
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm really sorry.

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,960
It's not your fault.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,120
You don't need to apologize.

81
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
Actually, ever since Wang Yu died,

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Erniang has been having

83
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,360
a difficult life in the Wang family.

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
She's a strong woman

85
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,360
and she wouldn't accept our help.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,240
She's also seriously ill.

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,640
Is she seriously ill?

88
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,480
Has she seen a physician?

89
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,120
Don't know what kind of

90
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,560
physician the Wang family found for her.

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,960
She's been taking medicine,

92
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,120
but her condition

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,640
hasn't got any better.

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,400
I found a physician for her,

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,840
but she refused to see him.

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,560
The other problems can be fixed.

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,960
But when it comes to treatment,

98
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
it needs her cooperation.

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
Don't worry about that.

100
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,040
As long as she takes medicine,

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
it can be solved.

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
You have an idea?

103
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,740
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,640
Ou Yanxing's idea is good.

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,600
If Erniang is willing to take medicine,

106
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,680
she will get better.

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,480
I was going to discuss it
with you first.

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,520
But I bumped into

109
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,760
Mr. Ou on my way home,

110
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,880
so I had a chat with him.

111
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
My Lord, if you think it's okay,

112
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,160
I'll do it.

113
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
Erniang treats you so badly,

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
yet you still care about her this much.

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,560
You've never blamed her?

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
I have.

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,960
But we are sisters after all.

118
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,760
And she's a poor woman.

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,320
I don't want her

120
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,560
to be bullied by others.

121
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
It's the luckiest thing

122
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,920
for Erniang

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that she has

124
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,280
a good sister like you.

125
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,760
My Lord, am I good

126
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,160
at everything in your eyes?

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,000
I guess.

128
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,480
It's not bad at least.

129
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Your Ladyship.

130
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
Lady Shiyi.

131
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Jinlian.

132
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
I call you over today

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,720
to ask you one question.

134
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Do you want to save your Young Madam?

135
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm willing to do anything

136
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,880
to save her.

137
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,160
Luckily, Erniang has you by her side.

138
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Jinlian.

139
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,920
I'm about to die.

140
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,280
But I'm worried about you

141
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,920
the most.

142
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,840
Just leave this troubled place.

143
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,320
No one can protect you anymore

144
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
after I'm dead.

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,320
I won't leave.

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Young Madam,

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,960
I have medicine here.

148
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,520
You will get better

149
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
after taking this.

150
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,720
Medicine?

151
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
What medicine?

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
I... I met a roving physician

153
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
on the street.

154
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
He gave me a secret prescription

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,440
specially for your illness.

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
There's no such secret prescription.

157
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,200
Jinlian,

158
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,400
no need to bother.

159
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,760
At this point,

160
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,720
just let it be.

161
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,280
Young Madam,

162
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
don't you remember

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,720
how Lady Shiyi

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,920
laughed at you?

165
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,560
She said you were a coward

166
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,160
who complained all the time.

167
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,200
If you give up like this,

168
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,880
she will get her way.

169
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,480
Are you really

170
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,520
going to let her look down

171
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,560
upon you?

172
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,000
What did you say?

173
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
Young Madam.

174
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
If you gave up

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,240
like this,

176
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,960
you would

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,280
completely lose

178
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,000
to Lady Shiyi.

179
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
Do you want that to happen?

180
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,600
As long as you get better,

181
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,840
you'll still have a long way to go.

182
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
And one day,

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,760
you will make those people
who despise you

184
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,040
pay for what they did.

185
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
Young Madam,

186
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,000
please don't give up.

187
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,910
Young Madam.

188
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,600
You are right.

189
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
I can't let them look down upon me.

190
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,160
No matter what,

191
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,440
I have to give it a try.

192
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
I can't let Shiyi

193
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,640
laugh at me.

194
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,280
The medicine.

195
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,680
Give me the medicine.

196
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,440
Here, Young Madam.

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,820
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

198
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,640
Here.

199
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
This roving physician

200
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,720
is really good.

201
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,040
You've only taken the medicine
for a few days

202
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,200
and you've already

203
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
got much better.

204
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,720
They all want me to be dead.

205
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,360
But I must get better.

206
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,280
When I'm well again,

207
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
I'll kick

208
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,720
that woman out for sure.

209
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,200
How come

210
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
there's no one is this yard?

211
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,760
Young Madam,

212
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,120
you just got a little better.

213
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
If that Lady Wang-Liu finds it out,

214
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,720
she'll harm you again.

215
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,080
Now, hurry to lie down.

216
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,280
Greetings, Young Madam.

217
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
I'm just here to see

218
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,160
if you are getting any better.

219
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,520
Young Madam's condition

220
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
is worsening day by day.

221
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
And now,

222
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
she can't even speak.

223
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
Madam, please be kind

224
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,840
and find another

225
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
physician for Young Madam.

226
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,560
Young Madam's condition

227
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
keeps worsening.

228
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,560
Even the best physician

229
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,400
won't be able to save her.

230
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,680
Just

231
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,720
take good care

232
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,640
of her.

233
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,440
Here.

234
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,900
(Precious Breezes and Dew of the Moon)

235
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,000
Looks like she doesn't
have much time left.

236
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Keep a close eye on her.

237
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,840
Don't make any mistakes.

238
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,040
Yes.

239
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,080
When the Superior Man eats,
he does not try to stuff himself;

240
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,320
at rest he does not seek perfect comfort;

241
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
he is diligent in his work
and careful in speech.

242
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Tell me.

243
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,560
Have you forgotten

244
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,760
the things you've learned?

245
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
But Confucius also said,

246
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,360
food and beautiful things
are basic human desires.

247
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,880
Eating is a basic need for human beings.

248
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
It's just your excuse.

249
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,800
That's not what Confucius meant at all.

250
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,680
Who taught you that?

251
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Mother.

252
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,080
Nonsense.

253
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Your mother wouldn't misinterpret

254
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,560
Confucius' words.

255
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,240
Mother.

256
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
My Lord.

257
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,320
Why are you angry again?

258
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm not angry.

259
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,200
Master Zhao has been waiting

260
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,280
for him to go to the class,

261
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,760
but he's messing around here.

262
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,040
My Lord,

263
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,800
Zhun is still a kid.

264
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,400
It's normal that he likes playing.

265
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,240
A kid who likes playing
is usually smart.

266
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,560
He skipped classes
for two and a half days

267
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,600
when he's supposed to study
for three days.

268
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,560
Does that sound smart to you?

269
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Master Zhao is going to
leave out of anger.

270
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,600
What do you think we should do?

271
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,720
My Lord,

272
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
why don't we let Yu and Zhun

273
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,440
study together?

274
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,080
For one,

275
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,600
Yu is older than Zhun.

276
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,160
He can be a good example for him.

277
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,040
For two,

278
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
Yu's teacher Master Kong

279
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,520
hasn't been available for long

280
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,560
because his mother is ill.

281
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,680
We can't let Yu fall behind

282
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
in his study.

283
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,280
If they go to school together,

284
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,360
they can keep each other's company.

285
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Yu,

286
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,080
would you like

287
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,240
to study together with your brother?

288
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Yes, I would.

289
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,480
I will study hard

290
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,400
and I will encourage
my brother to do so.

291
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,560
Now, rise.

292
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,120
In the future, you two
will study together.

293
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,520
I will let Concubine Wen know.

294
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,760
Yes, Father.

295
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,800
I don't agree

296
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,640
with you two.

297
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,600
Although we can't let Yu

298
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,080
fall behind in his study,

299
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,360
Yu and Zhun have different status.

300
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,960
They should be taught separately

301
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
so that they can both learn
what they need.

302
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,360
Otherwise, if we put them together,

303
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,280
it'll cause a lot of trouble
in the future.

304
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,280
Think about it.

305
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,720
So many brothers of prominent families

306
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,200
fought each other

307
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,080
to the point that
their families got destroyed.

308
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,000
You should learn from those lessons.

309
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Mother.

310
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
Cao Cao attached more importance
to Cao Zhi than Cao Pi,

311
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,520
that's why Cao Zhi came up with
the Seven-step Poem.

312
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,040
If Cao Cao had treated them equally,

313
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,680
Zhi and Pi would've had

314
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
a firm tie of brotherhood

315
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,240
and built a strong bond.

316
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,280
If they had worked together as a team,

317
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,720
the Wei Dynasty
would've had a promising future.

318
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,240
I understand

319
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,400
that because you are
an illegitimate daughter,

320
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,400
you think the kids
should be treated equally.

321
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
But these are the rules

322
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
set by our ancestors.

323
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,160
There must be a reason for that.

324
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,320
It's not that simple.

325
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,960
Mother, you are right.

326
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,080
But just because

327
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,560
I had similar experience,

328
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,280
I understand more

329
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,280
that the conflict between siblings

330
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,520
is not because they have

331
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,960
different status,

332
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,800
but because of
the lack of communication.

333
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,360
So you mean

334
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm wrong,

335
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,960
or the rules are wrong?

336
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,880
Mother.

337
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,960
It's actually my idea.

338
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
Zhun likes to play.

339
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,160
Yu, on the other hand,

340
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,400
is diligent in study.

341
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,720
If they can

342
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,120
study together,

343
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Yu can be a good example

344
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,560
for Zhun,

345
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,840
which will only do good to Zhun.

346
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,040
Since you've made

347
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
a decision,

348
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
I won't interfere anymore.

349
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,080
Mother,

350
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,000
you are the pillar

351
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,360
of our Xu family.

352
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,080
That's right, Mother.

353
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,080
You watched

354
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,640
all the children growing up.

355
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,280
There are so many things I don't know

356
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,920
and I still need to learn from you.

357
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,800
Shiyi,

358
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
you've done an excellent job.

359
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,920
You don't need

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,280
an old woman like me

361
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,080
to teach you anymore.

362
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm still inexperienced.

363
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,640
The bridges you've crossed are even more

364
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,200
than the paths we've walked.

365
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,640
How can I compare to you, Mother?

366
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,240
Alright.

367
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,800
Let's start eating.

368
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,600
You two are echoing

369
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,840
each other's words,

370
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,040
which is even more interesting

371
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,720
than the play I watched.

372
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,920
Here.

373
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,500
(Virtue of Modesty and Patience)

374
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,400
Yu is gentle and kind.

375
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,880
He looks more like a scholar.

376
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
I think taking the imperial exams
will be suitable for him.

377
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,070
My Lord, you spent most of the time
on the battlefields.

378
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,040
You don't know your kids
well enough yet.

379
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
Now that you've been transferred back,

380
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,160
you can talk to them more

381
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,560
when you have time.

382
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,280
I think they'll surprise you.

383
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,400
Yu is not a little kid anymore.

384
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,360
I can't let him study

385
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,840
with Zhun all the time.

386
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm going

387
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,200
to send him to the Jinxi Academy

388
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,600
in Leshan next year.

389
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
Next year?

390
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,360
Yu is only ten years old,

391
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,600
and you'll send him to such a far place

392
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,480
to study?

393
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,160
An uncut gem goes not sparkle.

394
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,280
Besides, Master Jiang
in the Jinxi Academy

395
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,240
is well-known for his wisdom

396
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,480
and characters

397
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
among the scholars.

398
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
Ambitious men should aim far.

399
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,400
Studying there will help him

400
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,640
open his eyes

401
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,880
and broaden his mind.

402
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,040
It'll do nothing bad but only good

403
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,160
to his future.

404
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,680
That makes sense, My Lord.

405
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,480
Actually,

406
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,920
I also have other concerns.

407
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,480
What concerns?

408
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,760
The Wen family do business
on the coast all the year round.

409
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,360
They must have some

410
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,560
sort of business connection
with the Ou family.

411
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,120
Concubine Wen
has been restless since she

412
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,280
married into our Xu family,

413
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,000
which makes me

414
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,120
a little confused.

415
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,480
My Lord, you still suspect
that Concubine Wen

416
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,000
is the informer of the Ou family?

417
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm not sure.

418
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
But I can't rule
that possibility out either.

419
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,800
So you want to send

420
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Yu away

421
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,200
in case he's used.

422
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,880
Madam,

423
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,360
Yu is such a great kid.

424
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
Although he's asked to
study together with Zhun,

425
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,120
everybody can see

426
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,040
that our Yu

427
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
is much more diligent than Zhun.

428
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,280
Of course.

429
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,240
If my Yu weren't this

430
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,600
outstanding,

431
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,240
His Lordship wouldn't
value him this much.

432
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,800
Our Yu

433
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,160
is just as good as the others.

434
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,440
He deserves it.

435
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,280
Since His Lordship

436
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,080
thinks so highly of Yu,

437
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
I need to seize the opportunity

438
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,880
and find him a wife from a noble family

439
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
so as to secure his position.

440
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,320
Madam,

441
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,720
then you should talk to Second Madam.

442
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,920
She's from a prominent family

443
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,360
and has many connections.

444
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,320
Most importantly,

445
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,600
she likes our Yu.

446
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,960
I'm sure she'll be willing to help.

447
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,560
That makes sense.

448
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,760
It's better to do it sooner than later.

449
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Come on, we'll go right now.

450
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,200
Yu,

451
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,760
do you have a plan for your future?

452
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,880
My teacher taught me

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,280
that ambitious men should travel more,

454
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,120
see more and learn more.

455
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,240
I'm a slow learner.

456
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
I can't fight battles

457
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,600
and make military exploits

458
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,840
like father did.

459
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,600
But I want to create

460
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,480
a future of my own.

461
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
I want to study hard and strive

462
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,160
for scholarly honor

463
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,440
to win glory for our Xu family.

464
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,560
Good.

465
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
That's quite an aspiration.

466
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,120
Then

467
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,400
is it okay for you if I send you

468
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
to Jinxi Academy in Leshan

469
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,040
Sichuan province to study?

470
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,040
What's wrong?

471
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,600
You don't want to go?

472
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,120
I don't mean that.

473
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
Master Jiang of Jinxi Academy

474
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,280
was once a top scholar.

475
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,960
He left the court to engage himself
in teaching.

476
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,440
No one can compare to him

477
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,280
in terms of characters and knowledge.

478
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,720
I've admired him for a long time.

479
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Good.

480
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,440
I'm very glad

481
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
that you have such ambition.

482
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,600
When you arrive at the Academy,

483
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,400
you've got

484
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,040
to study hard

485
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,720
and must not be slack.

486
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,120
I won't let you down.

487
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,800
Please rise.

488
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,080
Master Zhao is still waiting for you.

489
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,840
Go ahead.

490
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,360
I'll take my leave.

491
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,120
My Lord, Second Madam is here.

492
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,480
Let her in.

493
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,480
My Lord, sorry to bother you.

494
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,480
Never mind.

495
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,680
You seldom come to Banyuepan.

496
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,960
What brought you here today?

497
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,120
I heard that you are going to send Yu

498
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,280
to Jinxi Academy.

499
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,000
There's something

500
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,040
I don't know if I should tell you.

501
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Please go ahead.

502
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,080
Concubine Wen came to me yesterday

503
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
and asked me to be Yu's matchmaker.

504
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,240
Concubine Wen

505
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,680
saw that I've been paying

506
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,120
attention to Yu recently,

507
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,520
so she has some other thoughts.

508
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,920
No matter what, Yu's marriage

509
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,600
should be arranged by Shiyi.

510
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,720
Since she came to me,

511
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,120
I think she knows

512
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,040
that you wouldn't agree.

513
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,480
You are indeed insightful.

514
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,920
Concubine Wen

515
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,640
is after all a businessman's daughter.

516
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,640
My Lord, since you've made a decision,

517
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,880
you'd better have Yu

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,320
get ready for his trip soon,

519
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,920
in case Concubine Wen

520
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,560
gets in the way of his study.

521
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,640
Okay.

522
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
Your Ladyship, Concubine Wen is here.

523
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
Your Ladyship. I'm begging you.

524
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,200
Please don't sent Yu to Leshan.

525
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,440
Please.

526
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,720
Get up first.

527
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,720
Your Ladyship.

528
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,960
I assure you

529
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,080
that Yu is a good boy

530
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
and he'll be

531
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,280
as filial as Zhun to you

532
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,480
in the future.

533
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,320
He's been

534
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,600
seeing you as his own mother.

535
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,360
Your Ladyship, please.

536
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,560
Don't send him away.

537
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,920
It's so inappropriate.

538
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,080
Amber, Dongqing.

539
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,480
Help Concubine Wen to get up.

540
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,040
Sit down and let's talk.

541
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,480
Why do you not want Yu
to go to Leshan?

542
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,920
Yu is too young.

543
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,200
Gan Luo became a Prime Minister
when he was 12.

544
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,440
Grand Secretary Chen

545
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,400
passed the imperial exams
when he was 11.

546
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,240
Yu is not young anymore.

547
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
But

548
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,440
Leshan is too far.

549
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
I don't want him to leave me.

550
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
Ambitious men should aim far.

551
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,280
They can't be kept in the room

552
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,560
like girls.

553
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,800
Otherwise,

554
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,480
how can he

555
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,920
protect you in the future?

556
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,840
But...

557
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,840
Does Yu know

558
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,960
that you came here?

559
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
He doesn't.

560
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,160
The teacher Jiang Song in Jinxi Academy

561
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
was once a top scholar.

562
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,520
It's a rare opportunity for Yu

563
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,720
to have such a famous teacher.

564
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,240
You should've

565
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,880
talked to Yu first before you came here.

566
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,640
My Lord.

567
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,000
It's my decision

568
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,720
to send Yu to Jinxi Academy.

569
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,440
My Lord.

570
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
As parents,

571
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,120
we should put

572
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
our children's future first.

573
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,480
Are you really going

574
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,520
to take care of him for a lifetime?

575
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,440
The decision has been made.

576
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
You need not to worry.

577
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,120
And don't bother Yizhen anymore.

578
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes.

579
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,280
It's must be Shiyi.

580
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
She saw that His Lordship

581
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,840
attached importance to my Yu,

582
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,240
so she wants to send him away.

583
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,040
She thinks she won.

584
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,040
I won't give up easily.

585
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,360
Concubine Wen acted like that
because she's worried.

586
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,920
After all, her son will travel to
such a far place.

587
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,480
Parents all hope their children

588
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,800
can stay with them.

589
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,240
But Yu

590
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
is also my son.

591
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,640
She claimed that she cares about him.

592
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm just afraid that she'd

593
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,600
actually ruin his future

594
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,160
in the name of doing right by him.

595
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,960
The Longjing tea harvested
before Qingming smells so good.

596
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,080
And it's the right temperature

597
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,480
to drink it

598
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,400
My Lord, would you like to taste it?

599
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,520
General Fu,

600
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,240
why did you ignore me?

601
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,320
I didn't.

602
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,160
What's wrong with your neck?

603
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,120
What are you doing?

604
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I strained it when I trained.

605
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,200
Let me give you a massage.

606
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,520
You don't have to.

607
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,680
Are you mimicking me?

608
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,320
Does this medicine work?

609
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,760
His Lordship gave it to me.

610
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,800
Of course it works.

611
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,560
But I think

612
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,960
my method will work better.

613
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,160
What method?

614
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,240
What's the matter with you?

615
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
Did... Did it hurt that badly?

616
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,240
That badly?

617
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,360
Why don't you sit down and try it?

618
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,160
I'll pass.

619
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,920
No way.

620
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,880
Let... Let go of me.

621
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,400
You are such a bully.

622
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,680
My neck is not hurt anymore.

623
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Her Ladyship was looking for you.

624
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Where have you been?

625
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,720
I...

626
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
I went to collect the clothes.

627
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Where are the clothes?

628
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Gosh. The clothes.

629
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Isn't it His Lordship's medicine?

630
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,560
(Why does Dongqing have it?)

631
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,060
(Honor the Ancestors
and Benefit the Offspring)

632
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Congrats, Young Madam.

633
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,240
You are recovered.

634
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,880
Thanks

635
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,040
to your attentive care,

636
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm finally recovered.

637
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,760
Lady Shiyi,

638
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,480
you've done so much

639
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,760
to help Young Madam.

640
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,440
Why don't you tell her what you did?

641
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,040
Do you think

642
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,320
she'll still accept it

643
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,880
if she knows that I'm the one

644
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,200
who's helping her?

645
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,760
Don't worry.

646
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,480
Just do as I said.

647
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
Erniang will be saved.

648
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
Young Madam, you've been

649
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,800
very nice to me.

650
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,800
Even when you were seriously ill,

651
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,160
you still cared so much about me.

652
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,600
It's my duty to take good care of you.

653
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Now that I've got back on my feet,

654
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,200
I'll take everything
that belongs to me back.

655
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,080
That Lady Wang-Liu

656
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
has been waiting for
the news of my death.

657
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,000
Go out now and tell them

658
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,200
that I've got better

659
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
under your care,

660
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,960
and that I'll be well soon.

661
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,200
Yes.

662
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,400
I'll let everybody know

663
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,240
that I'm the matron of Wang family.

664
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,920
Madam, what do you need me for?

665
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,840
I still need

666
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,880
to take care of Young Madam.

667
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,020
(Honor the Ancestors
and Benefit the Offspring)

668
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,640
Jinlian,

669
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,760
you are old enough

670
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,240
to get married now.

671
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,120
We no longer need you

672
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,800
to take care of Young Madam.

673
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,920
What do you mean?

674
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,320
In the future,

675
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,800
you will belong to this man.

676
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,280
I'm the only one who

677
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
cares about you now.

678
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,480
Young Madam has just
got a little better,

679
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,920
and you are going to kick me out.

680
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,640
You can't wait

681
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
for her to die, can you?

682
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,600
You are just a maid.

683
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,320
How dare you show disrespect

684
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,600
to your master?

685
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,640
Slap her.

686
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,060
(Precious Breezes and Dew of the Moon)

687
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,920
Who said you were a master?

688
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,320
Mr. Huang,

689
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,360
this maid

690
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,400
will belong to you in the future.

691
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,280
Take her away.

692
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,440
Thank you, Madam.

693
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,760
Young Lady.

694
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,200
Young Lady, go home with me.

695
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,720
I am...

696
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,840
I will take good care of you.

697
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,480
-I...
-Stop it.

698
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,920
Let's go.

699
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,940
(Precious Breezes and Dew of the Moon)

700
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,540
(Honor the Ancestors
and Benefit the Offspring)

701
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
Young... Young Madam.

702
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,560
You've recovered?

703
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,600
What?

704
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,320
Does my recovery

705
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,800
disappoint you?

706
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,560
No.

707
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,360
That's not what I meant.

708
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,720
Lady Wang-Liu,

709
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,000
you are only an outsider who temporarily

710
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,800
helps me manage

711
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,520
the household when I was ill.

712
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
Yet you are blinded by your greed.

713
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,720
Not only have you replaced

714
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,760
the servants,

715
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
you've also violated the rules

716
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,240
and were going to sell my dowry maid

717
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,560
to a stranger.

718
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,760
Just on that alone,

719
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,680
I can have you punished by law.

720
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,240
Guards.

721
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,280
Send Lady Wang-Liu and this guy

722
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,600
to Shuntian Prefecture Office.

723
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,160
Yes.

724
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,640
Don't. Don't. Don't.

725
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,200
No.

726
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,880
Don't. Please don't.

727
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,800
Are you crazy?

728
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,320
Don't. Don't.

729
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,280
Have... have you forgot

730
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,960
who recruited you

731
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,880
into the Wang family,

732
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,520
and who paid you monthly allowance?

733
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,680
Lady Wang-Liu,

734
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,040
just save it.

735
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,240
They've become my people long time ago.

736
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,840
You...

737
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Young Madam.

738
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,320
I have nothing to do with it.

739
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,120
I... I was deceived by her.

740
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,960
Mr. Huang,

741
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,160
what nonsense are you talking about?

742
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,680
Fine.

743
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,560
Then I'll let you go

744
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,520
after you write a statement.

745
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,800
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

746
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,000
I'll... I'll write it.

747
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,880
I promise.

748
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,800
My son.

749
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,200
Hurry and help me.

750
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,960
She will send me

751
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,150
to the government.

752
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,800
You are now the heir of Duke Mao.

753
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,190
You don't need to be afraid of her.

754
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,280
The entire Wang family
will be yours in the future.

755
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,520
Here,

756
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,190
except for Duke Mao and Madam Wang,

757
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,800
you are the most powerful one.

758
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,080
Come on.

759
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,980
(Precious Breezes and Dew of the Moon)

760
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,840
Greetings, Mother.

761
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,520
Mother,

762
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,400
please forgive my birth mother

763
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,040
for my sake.

764
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,800
Since you've been

765
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,360
adopted by me,

766
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,960
she's no longer your mother.

767
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,080
I can let her go,

768
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,190
but you have to give an order

769
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,710
that she

770
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,800
and her people

771
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
must leave here

772
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
in three days,

773
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,880
and they aren't allowed to enter

774
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,000
the Wang family without my permission.

775
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,480
My son,

776
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,960
just let her sue me.

777
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,840
So what

778
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,040
if they'll flog me?

779
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm not afraid of it.

780
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,640
Otherwise,

781
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,680
I'll go to Shuntian Prefecture Office

782
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,880
and sue you for being unfilial.

783
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,200
You've become my adopted son,

784
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,200
yet you still cover for
your birth mother's wrongdoings

785
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,320
and neglect the order of
your adopted mother.

786
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,240
Young Madam, you don't even care

787
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
about the Wang family's name anymore?

788
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,680
Even if you don't care about the name

789
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,560
of the Wang family,

790
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,240
the Luo family is
a prominent clan in Jiangnan

791
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,840
that has served the court
for generations,

792
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,480
and the Xu family are also
high-ranking officials.

793
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,480
If you don't care

794
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,680
about their reputation either,

795
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,280
just go ahead and sue me.

796
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,520
Send Lady Wang-Liu

797
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,720
to Shuntian Prefecture Office right now.

798
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,280
Jinlian, get the carriage ready.

799
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,280
We'll go, too.

800
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,960
Yes.

801
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,200
Don't. Please don't.

802
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,420
(Honor the Ancestors
and Benefit the Offspring)

803
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,160
Young Madam.

804
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,480
Young Madam.

805
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Young Madam. I made a mistake.

806
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,640
I know I'm wrong.

807
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,840
I dare not to do that again.

808
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,120
I'll leave here right away.

809
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,480
I'm begging you.

810
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,880
Please forgive us.

811
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,000
Jinlian,

812
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,520
watch her

813
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,960
and make sure she leaves.

814
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Also, kick those

815
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,440
people she brought in

816
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,720
out of our family.

817
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,880
Search everybody

818
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,280
who leaves our house.

819
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,760
If any object of our family
is found on them,

820
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,000
send them all to
Shuntian Prefecture Office

821
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,240
for the crime of theft.

822
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,480
Yes, Young Madam.

823
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,800
Young Madam.

824
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,920
That Lady Wang-Liu left?

825
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,720
Yes.

826
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,240
She packed her stuff the next morning

827
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,600
and left with her people.

828
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,400
Lady Erniang

829
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,360
even had people

830
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,640
search them at the gate.

831
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,640
That does sound like
something Erniang would do.

832
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,880
Everything you did for her

833
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,000
finally paid off.

834
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,280
But,

835
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,400
Duke Mao doesn't care about
the household affairs.

836
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
Erniang has only her adopted son,

837
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,640
and she has to take care

838
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,280
of her ill mother-in-law.

839
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,800
I'm worried

840
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,700
that some street gangsters

841
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,960
will make trouble for them.

842
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,680
Amber,

843
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,360
ask Steward Bai to send a letter

844
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,240
to the Magistrate of
Shuntian Prefecture Office.

845
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,880
Let them keep an eye on the Wang family

846
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,720
every now and then.

847
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,920
Amber,

848
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,560
give Steward Bai

849
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,440
20 tael of silver

850
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,360
and ask him to treat
those bailiffs some wine.

851
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,640
Yes.

852
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,080
Don't worry.

853
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,640
No one dares to make trouble for them.

854
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,320
My Lord, let me thank you
on Erniang's behalf.

855
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
(Account Books)

856
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,680
Young Madam,

857
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,920
these are the account books.

858
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,880
Please review.

859
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
(Account Books)

860
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,320
Finally they are back

861
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
in my hands again.

862
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,800
Looking back,

863
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,760
it was like a dream.

864
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,320
Congrats, Young Madam.

865
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,400
From now on,

866
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,280
you'll be the matron

867
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,120
of this mansion.

868
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,040
No one dares to look down upon
you anymore.

869
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,360
Although I hate Shiyi,

870
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,680
she is right about something.

871
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,720
Complaining wouldn't help with anything.

872
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,760
Only by making myself strong

873
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,560
can I hold my head up high.

874
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,260
(Xianling Pavilion)

875
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,000
Shiyi.

876
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Teacher.

877
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Shiyi.

878
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,960
I have fantastic news.

879
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,560
Seeing how happy you are,

880
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,640
I guess

881
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,480
we've just received

882
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
a big order, right?

883
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,240
Even better than that.

884
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
You know what?

885
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,520
The Palace will hold
a birthday celebration for His Majesty.

886
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,000
The inner palace is shorthanded,

887
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,280
so they'll use some embroidery
from folk workshops.

888
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,200
Because of the excellent

889
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,520
embroidery skills of
our Xianling Pavilion,

890
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,840
we are qualified for the pre-screening.

891
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,920
We need to make

892
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,160
an embroidery work as soon as possible

893
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,440
and deliver it to the Palace.

894
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,960
If it's chosen,

895
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,000
our Xianling Pavilion

896
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,920
will become world-famous.

897
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,720
By then,

898
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,120
our embroidery skills

899
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,520
will be widely circulated.

900
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,960
That's right.

901
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,720
Since it's His Majesty's birthday,

902
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,960
we need to think of

903
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,720
a propitious embroidery pattern.

904
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,720
Oh, right.

905
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,800
Bring me the pattern book.

906
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,080
Let's figure out

907
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,280
what to embroider.

908
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,440
Let me see.

909
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,400
Take a look.

910
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,120
What should we embroider?

911
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
How about this?

912
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,120
How about "Magu Celebrates
The Queen Mother's Birthday"?

913
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,920
"Bodhisattva Lotus Sutra"
is not bad either.

914
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,720
Both are good,

915
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,280
but if we want to
make our work stand out,

916
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,320
we need to think of a unique idea.

917
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,200
Why don't we make a
"One Hundred Longevity Picture"?

918
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,120
"One Hundred Longevity Picture"?

919
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,240
I'm thinking

920
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,240
we can use "One Hundred
Longevity Picture" as the main pattern

921
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,280
and make it a centerpiece of the room.

922
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,760
But unlike the previous ones,

923
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,200
the 100 "Longevity" characters

924
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
in our picture

925
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,040
will be all written

926
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,280
in different styles

927
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,440
and different scripts,

928
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
including

929
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,520
seal, semi-cursive, regular, cursive

930
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,240
and such.

931
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,160
We can also mix them with the different

932
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,760
handwritings of
the famous calligraphers of all ages,

933
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,200
representing a long and eternal life.

934
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,440
Good.

935
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,800
It's such

936
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
a good idea.

937
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,080
Calligraphy embroidery
requires excellent skills.

938
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,320
It's a good opportunity for our girls

939
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,600
to show their talent.

940
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,960
But

941
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,560
we need to find someone

942
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,960
to talk about the writing.

943
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,360
Master Jian.

944
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,640
Mr. Ou.

945
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,800
-Mr. Ou.
-Master Jian.

946
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,120
Madam Xu, you are also here.

947
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,240
That's even better.

948
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,000
The one who's in charge of the birthday

949
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
celebration is Ou Lixing?

950
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Yes, it is my brother.

951
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,400
I think

952
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,000
you should be aware of that.

953
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,000
If he knows that you are involved,

954
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,040
I'm afraid he'll do something

955
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,160
to make trouble for you.

956
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,520
Thank you for your reminder, Mr. Ou.

957
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,280
I still have

958
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,280
a meeting with a business partner.

959
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,240
I can't stay for long.

960
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,480
I'll take my leave now.

961
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,320
Let me see you out.

962
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:47,920
Okay.

963
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,960
Mr. Ou, take care.

964
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,000
This time,

965
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,840
we'll embroider a
"One Hundred Longevity Picture"

966
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,360
for His Majesty's birthday.

967
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,880
I heard that you are
good at calligraphy,

968
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,280
so I'm wondering

969
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,960
if I can bother you

970
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,680
to write the main pattern for us.

971
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,800
It's my pleasure to help.

972
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,800
Master Jian,

973
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,800
we are friends.

974
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,080
Just feel free to ask.

975
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
In that case, thank you very much.

976
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,480
Master Jian, I'll leave now.

977
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,160
Alright.

978
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,940
(Longevity)

979
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,440
This calligraphy is very good.

980
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,360
Though it consists of different scripts,

981
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,000
it doesn't look awkward at all.

982
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,760
Instead, it's an

983
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,320
impeccable and

984
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,600
integrated work.

985
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,120
My Lord.

986
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,320
Shiyi,

987
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,000
I didn't expect that you are also

988
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,320
well-versed in calligraphy.

989
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
Calligraphy isn't my expertise.

990
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,840
This work isn't mine.

991
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,320
It's written by Ou Yanxing.

992
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,880
Why did you bring

993
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,800
his work home?

994
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,600
It's an embroidery pattern.

995
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,400
The Palace is collecting

996
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,000
embroidery from
folk workshops right now.

997
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,640
The ones that
can produce high-quality works

998
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,600
will be chosen to assist

999
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,880
the Palace with embroidery making

1000
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,280
for His Majesty's birthday celebration.

1001
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,480
Xianling Pavilion will use this
to participate in the selection.

1002
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
You must use his calligraphy?

1003
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,600
Master Jian thought

1004
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,560
that Mr. Ou is good at calligraphy,

1005
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,080
so she asked him for help.

1006
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,640
Otherwise, she doesn't have

1007
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,680
enough time to find

1008
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,960
another suitable person.

1009
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,020
(Longevity)

1010
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,560
This character

1011
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,640
is dull

1012
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,280
and was done in a rush.

1013
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,160
It doesn't look like
a masterpiece at all.

1014
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,040
Wouldn't it be boring

1015
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
just presenting a calligraphy

1016
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,920
to His Majesty?

1017
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,760
My Lord, but you just said...

1018
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,240
My Lord, do you have

1019
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,520
a better idea?

1020
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,320
Xianling Pavilion's matter

1021
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,760
is up to you.

1022
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,260
(Longevity)

1023
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,680
My Lord.

1024
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,700
(Longevity)

1025
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,000
Be careful.

1026
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,080
Don't wet the paper.

1027
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,680
My Lord, are you practicing calligraphy?

1028
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,140
(Longevity)

1029
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:17,800
So?

1030
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,920
How's my writing?

1031
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
My Lord, your writing

1032
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,000
flows nicely

1033
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
and looks vigorous.

1034
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,960
Do you think Shiyi

1035
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,840
would use mine

1036
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,960
as the pattern?

1037
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,600
My Lord,

1038
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,320
you are running out of paper.

1039
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,120
I'll go get some for you.

1040
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,920
My Lord.

1041
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,820
(Longevity)

1042
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,640
Why did you get in here

1043
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,280
without even

1044
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,160
notifying me?

1045
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,520
Since when am I not allowed

1046
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,280
to enter your study anymore?

1047
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,280
My Lord, what are you writing?

1048
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,360
Nothing.

1049
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,760
I was working.

1050
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,840
What are you doing here?

1051
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,080
The weather has been nice these days.

1052
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,840
I want to learn archery.

1053
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,080
General Fu told me

1054
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,880
that you've mastered excellent

1055
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,040
riding and shooting skills
since you were little.

1056
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,440
My Lord,

1057
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,000
could you please teach me?

1058
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,360
Why do you want to learn archery?

1059
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,680
I want to experience

1060
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,000
what Su Dongpo wrote,

1061
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,920
"My bow is like a full moon,
and aiming northwest,

1062
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,160
I will shoot down
the fierce Wolf from the sky."

1063
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,880
My Lord,

1064
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,280
would you please be kind and teach me?

1065
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,440
Alright.

1066
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,280
Let's go.

1067
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,720
My Lord, you are awesome.

1068
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,080
I guess, on the battlefield,

1069
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,800
it's all thanks
to your excellent shooting skills,

1070
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,400
you defeated those barbarian pirates,

1071
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,840
protected our people,

1072
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,440
and made our Ming military proud.

1073
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,840
Shiyi,

1074
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,040
have you heard a sentence,

1075
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,800
"When someone praises you
for no reason..."

1076
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,920
I meant what I said.

1077
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,000
Without heroes like you

1078
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,040
fighting the battles

1079
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,440
and protecting our country,

1080
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,400
no matter how talented

1081
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
those scholars

1082
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,760
and calligraphers are,

1083
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,640
they won't be able to enjoy the peace

1084
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,800
and show their talent.

1085
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,840
Just like

1086
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,040
without a thoughtful

1087
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,400
and understanding wife like you

1088
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,680
helping me
with the household management,

1089
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,040
I can't feel at ease
to fight the enemies

1090
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,120
and protect our country

1091
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,200
on the battlefield.

1092
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,920
Let me teach you.

1093
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,520
Ready.

1094
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,200
Loose.

1095
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,520
Bull's eye.

1096
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,400
Nothing can

1097
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,480
beat you, My Lord.

1098
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,320
That's true.

1099
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,040
Again.

1100
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,480
Actually, about the
"One Hundred Longevity Picture,"

1101
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,520
there's something else

1102
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,760
I want to discuss with you.
