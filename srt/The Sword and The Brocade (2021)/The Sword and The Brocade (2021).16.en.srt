who took the lead in creating trouble,

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,760
and bring them to
Shuntian Prefecture Office.

Yes.

54
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,040

This time,

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
the flooding

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,440
caused disasters everywhere.

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,880
The people's losses are immeasurable.

71
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,720
But as human,

72
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,920
what we can't lose the most

73
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,360
is dignity.

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,320
That makes sense.

75
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right.

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
I promise you

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
that as long as the Xu family is here,

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,800
the disaster relief soup kitchen
will be here.

79
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,120
Rice for disaster relief

80
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,600
won't stop coming either.

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,760

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
That's wonderful.

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160

-Thank you.
-Thank you.

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,400
-Thank you.
-He's a good man.

have been hard on you.

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,240
Can you still endure it?

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
I'm fine.

89
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,680
How can you be fine, Your Ladyship?

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,480
Your leg is gravely injured.

91

You're gravely injured.

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
It's just a minor injury. It's nothing.

93

104
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,240
Do a good job.

105

Don't leave any traces.

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
All right, thank you.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,160
I'll go and write the prescription.

172
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,320
I'll get going.

173
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,000
Does it hurt?

174
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,440
My Lord.

175
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll apply Her Ladyship's medicine.

176
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,240
I'll do it.

177
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
Yes, My Lord.

178
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
The physician said

179
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
that the medicine must be applied.

180
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:12,920
Are you feeling shy?

181
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,759
Who says so?

182
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,720
Wait.

183
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
I still need to bandage it.

184
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,280
Well... Dongqing can do that.

185
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,000
Serve Her Ladyship well.

186
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,080
Yes, My Lord.

187
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,120
Since we were little,

188
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
this was the first time

189
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,520
that I've seen you feel shy.

190
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,000
You brat.

191
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
Do you want to get hit?

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,920
However, Your Ladyship, don't you think

193
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,400
that His Lordship may seem cold,

194
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
but he's very caring towards you?

195
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,200
Did you get any favors
from His Lordship?

196
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,120
You keep saying good things about him.

197
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
I didn't.

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,920
Seeing

199
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
His Lordship so concerned about you

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,640
makes me really happy.

201
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,920
In the Xu family,

202
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,600
someone is finally nice to you.

203
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,040
My Lord.

204
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,969
(A humble manner
brings you a good result)

205
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,640
The Shuntian Prefecture Office just sent
someone to report to us

206
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,200
that one of the refugees

207
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
who caused trouble

208
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,960
suddenly died from an acute illness.

209
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,880
The Ou family is prepared.

210
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,840
It seems like it will be hard to get

211
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
any evidence against them.

212
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,960
If you didn't make prior arrangements,

213
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,840
it would be hard for me

214
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,120
to discover the Ou family's scheme.

215
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,160
It's all because you're insightful.

216
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,160
Shiyi told me

217
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,120
that you've provided

218
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,400
much assistance this time.

219
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,360
Thank you.

220
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,200
It's part of my job.

221
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,840
This time, Shiyi used the farmlands

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,640
in her dowries to get rice.

223
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,720
Please take care

224
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
of this matter for me.

225
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
Yes, My Lord.

227
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,160

228
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,960
It seems to be coming

229
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,320
from Master Lingkuan's area.

230

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,760
That was just a random guess.

233
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,880
Let me go and take a look.

234
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,880

Master Lingkuan, that line was wrong.

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll sing it for you.

241
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,720
-♪Which sentiments aren't...♪
-♪Which sentiments aren't...♪

242
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,560
Very nice.

243
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,240
Ling... Lingyi.

244
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,440
Sing.

245
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,800
Go on singing.

246
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,760
Lingyi, I know I was wrong.

247
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,960
I shouldn't sing Chinese Opera
here at home.

248
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,120
You shouldn't sing Chinese Opera
here at home?

249
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,520
No.

250
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,080
It was my mistake.

251
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,400
I... I shouldn't have gone out
to watch Chinese Opera,

252
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,320
and I shouldn't hire them

253
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
to teach me how to do it.

254
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,640
So in the past few days,

255
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,480
you were even watching Chinese Opera
outside the city?

256
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,800
Lingyi.

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,080
Don't... Don't smile that way.

258
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,160
When you smile that way,

259
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,720
it makes me feel flustered.

260
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
Scold me.

261
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,640
You're not wrong.

262
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
I am wrong.

263
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,520
Lingyi.

264
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,400
My Lord.

265
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,400
If Lingkuan does something wrong,

266
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,600
just say it.

267
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,440
Don't beat around the bush

268
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,840
in lecturing him.

269
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,840
I feel bad just listening to it.

270
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,280
Other siblings

271
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
are so close to each other.

272
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,800
But you're not satisfied

273
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,480
with whatever Lingkuan does.

274
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,280
You look so cold all day long.

275
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,400
Who can take that?

276
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,840
Danyang.

277
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Besides,

278
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,880
so what if Lingkuan went outside
the city to watch Chinese Opera?

279
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,080
Lingkuan's not bothering anyone

280
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,480
in singing Chinese Opera here at home.

281
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,320
He was just singing in his room.

282
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,160
You're just displeased with us.

283
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,640
Danyang.

284
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,800
Please, stop it.

285
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,840
All wealthy and influential families
in the capital

286
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,760
love watching Chinese Opera.

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,080
Only Lingkuan can't do it,

288
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,080
right?

289
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,720
Danyang.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,320
I remember that the physician said

291
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,320
you should go inside and rest

292
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,640
when the sun sets.

293
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,760
Otherwise,

294
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,720
the baby might feel the cold
emanating from the ground.

295
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,080
That won't be good.

296
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,520
Look, it's late.

297
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
Shouldn't you go inside?

298
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,880
I'll have a good chat with Lingyi.

299
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,080
Go.

300
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,560
Go.

301
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,320
Go.

302
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,840
Go.

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,560
Come on.

304
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,160
Lingyi.

305
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,240
Danyang was a bit rude.

306
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,760
Don't take it to heart.

307
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,240
Do you know that the Xu family

308
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,680
was almost doomed?

309
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Lingyi, what happened?

310
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,320
We went to pray at the temple

311
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,800
hoping

312
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,640
that things will go smoothly

313
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
at the soup kitchen

314
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,840
and those refugees

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,840
will suffer less.

316
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,880
I even lit a safety incense

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,520
for Danyang.

318
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
You're so thoughtful.

319
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,000
I haven't seen Danyang

320
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
for a while.

321
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
Come on, let's go and visit her.

322
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,360
All right.

323
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,200
I was wrong this time.

324
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
You can hit me or scold me.

325
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,560
Whatever you want.

326
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
How would I dare to do that?

327
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,840
You're the fifth son of the Xu family.

328
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,000
Who would dare to hit you?

329
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,600
What's going on?

330
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,880
Mother.

331
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,680
It's late at night.

332
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,360
Kuan'er, why are you kneeling?

333
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,080
Stand up.

334
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,920
Yi'er.

335
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,320
What exactly is going on?

336
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,800
This time, the Ou family

337
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,840
secretly caused trouble
for the disaster relief.

338
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,480
They used moldy rice to incite
refugees to cause trouble.

339
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,320
If Shiyi didn't handle the situation

340
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,320
and held on,

341
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,880
using her own dowry

342
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,080
to gather more rice,

343
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,440
we would already have committed
the crime of deceiving His Majesty.

344
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,640
Yet he knew nothing about it.

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
He went outside the city to watch
Chinese Opera.

346
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,880
Now,

347
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
Shiyi is injured

348
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,880
because of this matter.

349
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,880
He even brought the Chinese
Opera singers here

350
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,200
to indulge in it.

351
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,880
Is he part of the Xu family?

352
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,440
Does he deserve to be part
of the Xu family?

353
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
Kuan'er, why...

354
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,000
My Lord.

355
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,560
Stop blaming Lingkuan first.

356
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,000
Crime of deceiving His Majesty?

357
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,040
And what is going on about moldy rice
at the soup kitchen?

358
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,000
Great Madam.

359
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,200
I...

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,880
I really didn't know

361
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,520
that Mrs. Zhang would do such a thing.

362
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,360
I was kept in the dark.

363
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,680
Please believe me.

364
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,560
Lianfang.

365
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,880
Because I trust you,

366
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,960
I let you manage

367
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,280
the soup kitchen.

368
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,120
I didn't expect that you didn't know
the people around you clearly,

369
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,520
and almost brought trouble
upon the Xu family.

370
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,920
I

371
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,880
don't dare to ask for your forgiveness,

372
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,720
but Great Madam,

373
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,360
please believe me.

374
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,840
I definitely won't do anything

375
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,360
that's bad for the Xu family

376
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,600
and His Lordship.

377
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,360
Lingyi.

378
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,520
How do you think we should handle
this matter?

379
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,880
Mrs. Zhang bought the moldy rice.

380
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,400
Flog her 20 times and kick her out.

381
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,800
Sell of every servant

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,080
that had to do with this.

383
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,520
My Lord.

384
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,280
Mrs. Zhang is my nanny.

385
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,840
This time, she was just used
by the Ou family.

386
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,960
It was just a wrong decision made
in a moment of weakness.

387
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,760
A servant made a wrong decision
in a moment of weakness,

388
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
and the Xu family

389
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
almost committed the crime
of deceiving His Majesty.

390
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,640
If you made a wrong decision
in a moment of weakness,

391
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,920
wouldn't the entire Xu family

392
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,440
be killed then?

393
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Lianfang

394
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
kept using inappropriate people
for the job

395
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,360
and handling things in a muddled manner.

396
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,000
She can't handle the responsibility
of managing the household affairs.

397
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
That's enough.

398
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
I'm tired.

399
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Mrs. Zhang isn't young anymore.

400
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,320
I'll make the decision to exempt her

401
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,440
from flogging.

402
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,120
But she can't stay

403
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
with the Xu family anymore.

404
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,760
Lianfang, go back to your room.

405
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
Stop managing

406
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,760
the household affairs.

407
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,440
Thank you, Great Madam.

408
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,080
Mother.

409
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,640
Based on what happened, we can see

410
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,160
that Shiyi remained calm
in the hour of peril

411
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,200
and considered the overall situation,

412
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,800
while Lianfang

413
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,760
only evaded serious matters
and dwelled on trivial ones

414
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
to protect herself.

415
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,720
She even disregarded

416
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
the Xu family's safety.

417
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,840
In comparison,

418
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,520
Shiyi is more sensible

419
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,880
than Lianfang,

420
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,920
and it's more suitable for her
to manage the household affairs.

421
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,480
Yizhen.

422
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,200
You've heard the whole thing,

423
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,440
but you've remained quiet.

424
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,040
I want to hear your thoughts.

425
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
I think what His Lordship said
makes sense.

426
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,680
Shiyi didn't feel displeased

427
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,360
that Lianfang was managing
the household affairs

428
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,760
and took the opportunity
to take revenge.

429
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Instead, she thought of a way

430
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,000
to help the Xu family
surpass this challenge.

431
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,400
Based on that, we can see

432
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,040
that Shiyi looks at the big picture

433
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,320
and is benevolent.

434
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,280
And managing the household affairs

435
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
is actually the responsibility
of the legal wife.

436
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,840
You're right.

437
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,560
Letting a concubine manage
the household affairs

438
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,240
isn't a long-term arrangement.

439
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,200
Madam.

440
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,920
I've wronged you.

441
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,400
Due to a wrong decision in a
moment of weakness, I've harmed you.

442
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,400
Even if I regret it so much,

443
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,240
I can't stay

444
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,920
and serve you anymore.

445
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,160
Mrs. Zhang.

446
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
You are my nanny.

447
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,360
You've watched me grow up.

448
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,120
I know

449
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,320
your thoughts.

450
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
It's just that someone in this family

451
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
is displeased with me

452
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,120
and wants to defeat me.

453
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,880
This time,

454
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
Great Madam won't help me as well.

455
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,080
I can't let you stay here anymore.

456
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,480
Madam, I was wrong.

457
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,960
I've caused you harm.

458
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,520
Madam.

459
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,080
After I leave,

460
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
be on the guard

461
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,640
against that illegitimate daughter
of the Luo family.

462
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
If she manages the household affairs

463
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,280
then finds out

464
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,000
about what we did back then,

465
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm afraid

466
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,080
that your good days here

467
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
will be over.

468
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,920
In the future,

469
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,640
you must think thrice
before doing anything.

470
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,720
You must endure things.

471
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,840
Mrs. Zhang.

472
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,720
Return to the Qiao family with us.

473
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,040
Madam.

474
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,560
I can't bear to leave you.

475
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,080
In the future,

476
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,760
I won't be able to stay with you

477
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,520
and share your burdens anymore.

478
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,080
But you must remember

479
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,120
what I just said.

480
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,400
The Qiao family's already humiliated

481
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,040
with this scandal you committed.

482
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,040
Let's go.

483
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,400
Madam.

484
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,280
Stop talking.

485
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,400
Madam.

486
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,000
Mrs. Zhang.

487
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,080
Madam.

488
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,600
Tell me, am I too soft-hearted

489
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,440
towards Lianfang?

490
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,800
Great Madam.

491
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,520
You just care for her,

492
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,600
and you're afraid that she'd suffer.

493
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,680
Regarding her family background,

494
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,360
conduct, appearance,

495
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,000
or capability,

496
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,480
she pleases me in every way.

497
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,600
But the people working for her

498
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,880
were involved in the monkey business.

499
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,800
But this time,

500
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,760
if you don't punish Concubine Qiao,

501
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
I'm afraid it will be hard
to convince people.

502
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,360
She surely won't be able to manage

503
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,360
those servants working for us.

504
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,240
That's my worry too.

505
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,160
Tell me.

506
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,400
Which of the Xu family's servants

507
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,480
are easy to deal with?

508
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,840
Every one of them is cunning.

509
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,360
After what happened,

510
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,840
Lianfang definitely won't be able
to make them respect and fear her.

511
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,440
In the future, if they do evil,

512
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,880
the Xu family's reputation

513
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,800
will be doomed then.

514
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,520
Yes.

515
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,280
How can we punish Concubine Qiao

516
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
so that it won't harm her,

517
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,000
yet it can convince people?

518
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,400
This is so troubling.

519
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,280
Lingyi is filial,

520
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,360
but he

521
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,600
is so stubborn.

522
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,240
Since he already said it,

523
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,160
we'll do what he wants

524
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,520
and follow the rules.

525
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,440
It's just that

526
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,720
if I let Shiyi

527
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,920
manage the household affairs,

528
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
I'm thinking,

529
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,600
what if she makes a mistake?

530
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,440
We still need Lianfang then.

531
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,320
That's our only option.

532
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Go.

533
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,240
Tell Lianfang to give
the accounting books and keys

534
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,240
to Shiyi.

535
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,240
I won't go anymore.

536
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Yes.

537
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,160
Go.

538
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,440
All right.

539
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,000
Your Ladyship.

540
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,280
You will be managing

541
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,520
the household affairs now.

542
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,800
These are the 12 accounting books

543
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,600
and 20 keys.

544
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,400
If there's nothing else,

545
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,880
I'll get going.

546
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
This is good.

547
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,000
We're all finally doing
the jobs we should

548
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
and back in our proper places.

549
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,640
You brat.

550
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,920
Watch your mouth.

551
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,560
I did it on purpose.

552
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,400
I wanted her to hear it.

553
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,440
People must hear these words

554
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,240
that pleases everyone.

555
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,760
Your Ladyship.

556
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,000
Great Madam instructed me

557
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,440
to give this to you.

558
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Great Madam told me to tell you

559
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,600
that since you're managing

560
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,960
the household affairs starting today,

561
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,400
you must prioritize the Xu family
in everything

562
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,960
and obey the house rules
in doing things.

563
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,600
Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Du.

564
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,600
Your Ladyship, you just started managing
the household affairs.

565
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,120
There are still many things

566
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,280
to learn.

567
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,440
Familiarize yourself

568
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,840
with these accounting books first.

569
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,840
Tomorrow,

570
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,360
the heads of the servants in each area

571
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,080
will come and meet you.

572
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
From now on,

573
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,160
you'll be in charge

574
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,760
of everything in the household.

575
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,120
If there's something
you don't understand,

576
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,800
you can consult me.

577
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,480
Thank you, Mrs. Du.

578
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,080
No worries, Your Ladyship.

579
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,040
I won't bother you any longer.

580
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
I'll get going.

581
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,120
Your Ladyship.

582
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,280
This time,

583
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,040
we've really made it.

584
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,440
It's also good that I'm the one

585
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,240
who'll manage the household affairs now.

586
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,320
By the way,

587
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,080
Shiliu is also injured.

588
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
She was injured because of me.

589
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,360
Prepare one bottle
of top-quality wound medicine.

590
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,240
I'll go and visit her.

591
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,360
Madam.

592
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,960
First,

593
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,480
I lost Mrs. Liu's help.

594
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,280
Now, Mrs. Zhang is gone too.

595
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,440
Mrs. Zhang is right.

596
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,160
I can't belittle my rival anymore.

597
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,680
I want to get back everything

598
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,080
that belongs to me.

599
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,720
This is top-quality medicine
for your wound.

600
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
Use it, and it won't leave any scars.

601
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,320
Well...

602
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,160
It's just a scratch.

603
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,360
I'm fine.

604
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,520
Thank you for being so concerned,
Your Ladyship.

605
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,040
If you didn't save me,

606
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
I might have been the one
who got injured.

607
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,880
Your Ladyship, it's not that serious.

608
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,880
Your Ladyship, how's your leg injury?

609
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
It doesn't hurt anymore.

610
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,160
Oh, right.

611
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,040
You're managing
the household affairs now.

612
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,040
Let me congratulate you.

613
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,520
For the disaster relief this time,

614
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,400
everyone saw how hard you worked.

615
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,200
I believe that everyone
will be convinced

616
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,080
with you managing

617
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,680
the household affairs now.

618
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,520
I hope you're right.

619
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,480
His Lordship is here.

620
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Be careful.

621
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,320
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

622
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,480
Shiliu, you are injured.

623
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
I came to visit you.

624
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,080
Thank you, My Lord.

625
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,360
My Lord, have you had dinner?

626
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,320
What if

627
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
you have dinner here tonight?

628
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll get going then.

629
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,840
Stay and have dinner with us too.

630
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,080
Shiliu.

631
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,840
Set up the meal here.

632
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,480
Yes.

633
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,560
Sit down and eat with us too.

634
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,800
Well...

635
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,480
Sit down.

636
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,360
Yes.

637
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,520
Try this one.

638
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,840
Have some too.

639
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
Thank you, My Lord.

640
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,600
What's the matter?

641
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,920
Nothing.

642
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,240
I'm just not used to eating
Sichuan pepper.

643
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,720
I forgot.

644
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
You've lived in Jiangnan
for a long time.

645
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,240
The food there is blander.

646
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,920
It's my fault.

647
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,960
Before, His Lordship
was stationed at Miaojiang.

648
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,360
It was cold there at night,

649
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,360
so he needed to eat Sichuan pepper
to feel warm.

650
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,200
I was just thinking

651
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,360
about His Lordship's taste

652
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,800
but forgot to consider
Your Ladyship's taste.

653
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,120
It's fine, I don't blame you.

654
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,000
It's all because my taste
is just a bit delicate.

655
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,880
Your Ladyship, eat these bamboo shoots.

656
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,520
It has a light taste.

657
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,560
Tell the kitchen

658
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,760
to cook more light dishes.

659
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,320
All right.

660
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,520
There's no need.

661
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,440
This is fine.

662
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,760
Let's eat.

663
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,480
My Lord.

664
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,200
I happen to have a headache.

665
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,800
I'll go back and rest.

666
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,800
You two enjoy it.

667
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,720
You have a headache?

668
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,600
I'll take you back.

669
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,480
There's no need.

670
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,760
I can go by myself.

671
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,480
Your Ladyship, you don't feel well.

672
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,720
Let His Lordship take you back.

673
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,720
This way, I'll feel more at ease.

674
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,360
I won't bother you.

675
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,680
Your leg injury just got a bit better.

676
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,760
You can't exert much force.

677
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,600
Come.

678
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,240
It's dark.

679
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,200
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship,
be careful.

680
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,760
My Lord.

681
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,800
Based on what Steward Bai said,

682
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,040
the moldy rice

683
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,560
seems to have something to do
with the Ou family.

684
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,560
The Xu and Ou families

685
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,600
have been families of warriors

686
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,880
seasoned in countless battles
for many generations.

687
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,840
In the generation of Marquis Jingyuan,

688
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,240
the Ou family isn't contented
with their condition.

689
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,760
They crave power, causing harm
to the nation and citizens.

690
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,440
They wanted to use the sea ban
to frame the righteous.

691
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,840
My father and brother wanted to lift
the sea ban

692
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,480
in order to stop the pirates for good,

693
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,680
so they became obstacles
in the eyes of the Ou family.

694
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,920
Later on, my father and brother
died on the battlefield.

695
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,760
The entire Xu family was imprisoned.

696
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
That was all because of Marquis Jingyuan.

697
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,360
I didn't expect

698
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,280
that the Xu family would have
such a past.

699
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,040
If your grandfather didn't plead
with His Majesty

700
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,200
to permit me to go into battles
to redeem our sins,

701
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,560
the Xu family wouldn't be
what it is today.

702
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,960
It's all in the past now.

703
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,560
You relied on yourself

704
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,840
to revive the Xu family again.

705
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,040
I think the late Marquis
and your brother

706
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,560
would be able to rest in peace.

707
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,440
While treacherous officials
are still around,

708
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
the citizens won't be able
to live peacefully,

709
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
and my father and brother won't be able
to rest in peace.

710
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,360
Back then,

711
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,680
wasn't there any evidence to prove

712
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,480
that the Ou family was the one
who framed the late Marquis?

713
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,199
Back then, Marquis Jingyuan was Zhejiang's
Grand Coordinator.

714
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,880
How would he leave any evidence

715
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,280
that would cause harm to them?

716
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,560
Treacherous officials harm the nation
and get the righteous killed,

717
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,800
and only a memorial tablet is left
to commemorate them.

718
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,560
The Ou family framed the righteous

719
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,960
and do perverse things.

720
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,800
They'll get what they deserve
for their evil deeds.

721
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,720
Now, Marquis Jingyuan is managing
the Ministry of War.

722
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,920
His eldest son, Ou Lixing,

723
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,800
is the Vice Minister of Rituals,

724
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,679
and he married the Minister's
legitimate daughter.

725
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,240
The Ministry of Justice

726
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,720
also looks up to Marquis Jingyuan
for instructions.

727
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,960
How can it be easy

728
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,360
to defeat them?

729
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,599
And the Ou family's second son,

730
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,400
Ou Yanxing, is an illegitimate son.

731
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,600
He rarely shows himself.

732
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,840
There's almost no news

733
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,880
about him.

734
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,720
What's the matter?

735
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,840
We're here.

736
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,160
Be careful.

737
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,960
(Does he want to stay here overnight?)

738
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,160
(What if...)

739
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,560
(What if I get pregnant?)

740
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,280
Wait.

741
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,120
My Lord, tonight,

742
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,520
have you attended to Mother yet?

743
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,640
Yizhen is attending to Mother.

744
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,360
Besides, it's late now.

745
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,120
She must be sleeping already.

746
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,360
I shouldn't bother her.

747
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,800
Oh, right.

748
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,000
I just started managing
the household affairs today.

749
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,400
Later, I must still...

750
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,280
You don't need

751
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,760
to personally attend
to such trivial matters.

752
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,720
Come.

753
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,440
My Lord.

754
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,080
I'm thirsty after chatting for so long.

755
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,480
Do you have some tea here?

756
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,080
My Lord.

757
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,160
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

758
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,720
Make some good tea for His Lordship.

759
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,480
-Yes, Your Ladyship.
-Yes, Your Ladyship.

760
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,720
My Lord, rest here first.

761
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,600
I still have to check
the accounting books.

762
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,480
Go.

763
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,000
What happened to your hand?

764
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,120
A few days ago, I was embroidering,

765
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,600
and I accidentally stabbed myself
with the needle.

766
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,880
Are you all right?

767
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,280
I'm fine.

768
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,080
That's how it is
when you're embroidering.

769
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
It's nothing.

770
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,040
Why do you love embroidering so much?

771
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,400
Those beautiful flowers and plants

772
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,200
slowly bloom through my fingers.

773
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,040
I think that's

774
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,360
a very wonderful thing.

775
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Besides,

776
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,760
it can settle me down.

777
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,840
To a woman,

778
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,360
isn't marrying

779
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,080
a good husband supposed
to settle you down?

780
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
No matter how good you are
with needlework,

781
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,160
it's just a pastime.

782
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,520
After experiencing having no one
to rely on,

783
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,080
I realized

784
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,040
that I can only depend on myself.

785
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,760
Go.

786
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,240
Kuan'er, Yi'er, don't be scared.

787
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,120
I'm here.

788
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,800
Kuan'er, come.

789
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,720
Kuan'er.

790
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I'm here.

791
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,960
(His Lordship doesn't seem to have
any intentions of leaving.)

792
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,200
(Could it be)

793
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,000
(that I can't escape from it tonight?)

794
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,440
How strange.

795
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,400
Why did His Lordship

796
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,200
suddenly come here tonight?

797
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,680
Let's not care about that first.

798
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,440
His Lordship finally

799
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,080
came to our court.

800
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,320
We must do our best

801
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,360
to make him stay.

802
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,160
This way,

803
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,280
people will know

804
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,200
that His Lordship

805
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
stayed here overnight.

806
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,160
Let's see how others

807
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,000
can treat Her Ladyship coldly again.

808
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,320
There are so many accounting books.

809
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,280
Must you finish checking them tonight?

810
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,560
I'm meeting the heads
of servants tomorrow.

811
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,000
I must be prepared.

812
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,400
It still helps even if you
make an effort at the last minute.

813
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,400
If I

814
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,720
can't say anything tomorrow,

815
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,720
wouldn't the heads

816
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,280
look down on me then?

817
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,920
Your Ladyship.

818
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
It's late.

819
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,080
Should we prepare

820
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,360
His Lordship's bath?
