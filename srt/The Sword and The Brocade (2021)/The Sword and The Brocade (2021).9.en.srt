00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,640
It's the middle of the night.
Why aren't you sleeping?

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,280
I... I can't sleep.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,000
I want to read for a while.

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
Sleep in the warm partition then.

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
(He wants me to sleep
in the warm partition?)

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,720
All right.

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
I'll go there right away.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,800
You took the comforter away.

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
What about me?

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,520
My lord, this comforter
is too thin.

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,240
I'll tell Amber

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,520
to get you a thick one.

31
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,981

(Mansion of Xu)

33
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,520
Your Ladyship.

34
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,840
Your Ladyship.

35
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,960
Your Ladyship, wake up.

36
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,640
Where's His Lordship?

37
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,640
His Lordship went to the imperial court
early in the morning.

38
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,240
Your Ladyship.

39
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,320
Why did you sleep here?

40
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm not used to sleeping there,

41
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,160
so I slept here.

42
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,200
Aren't you afraid

43
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,480
that His Lordship will feel unhappy?

44
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,480
Who sleeps on separate beds

45
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
when they're newly married?

46
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,120
I don't seek his favor,

47
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,640
and I don't want his wealth and status.

48
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,560
I don't care if he's unhappy.

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
After I find the real killer,

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,240
I'll think of a way to leave
this mansion.

51
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Duke Wei.

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
The summer hunt is in a few days.

53
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
This time,

54
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,280
I think you'll still
make the first shot.

55
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,680
I'll be hunting alone,

56
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,480
there's no one to compete with me.

57
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,240
What's the point?

58
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,520
During the hunts in previous years,

59
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,200
Duke Wei and Official Hu

60
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,439
competed with each other

61
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,960
in a carefree manner
without any restraints.

62
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,000
Based on Duke Wei's tone,

63
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
he still hasn't gotten over

64
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
Official Hu's death.

65
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,480
But because of the imperial edict,

66
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,440
he can't directly express his thoughts
and sentiments.

67
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,120
Official Fan.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,960
Perhaps

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
we can take the opportunity
of the Summer Hunt

70
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,440
to have an open and honest discussion

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
with Duke Wei.

72
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,640
All right.

73
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,840
My lord.

74
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,320
Is the bed in the warm partition
too hard?

75
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,320
It's fine as long as you sleep well.

76
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
Are the gifts for your return
to your family's mansion ready?

77
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
Yes.

78
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,160
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

79
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,640
Her Ladyship's bother has arrived.

80
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,280
Greetings, Great Madam Luo.

81
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,360
These are gifts from my mother for you.

82
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,640
Thank you to Madam Luo.

83
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
She's so nice.

84
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,440
Lingyi.

85
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,040
Send my regards to Madam Luo
when you see her.

86
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
Thank her.

87
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
Yes, Mother.

88
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,920
It's getting late.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
Get going.

90
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,200
Marquis, Shiyi.

91
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,480
After you.

92
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,640
After you.

93
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,280
Greetings, Father-in-law.

94
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,680
After you, Marquis.

95
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,560
After you.

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,880
Newlyweds return to the Bridal Home.

97
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,520
Bow.

98
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Get up.

99
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,400
Bow.

100
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,480
Get up.

101
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,400
Bow.

102
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,320
Get up.

103
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
The ceremony is over.

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,800
Shiyi.

105
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,800
Let's chat in the room.

106
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,800
Let them talk here.

107
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,160
Yes.

108
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,400
Marquis, please have a seat.

109
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,280
That's how an illegitimate
daughter is indeed.

110
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,959
Yuanniang spent so much effort
to pave the way for you.

111
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,920
I didn't expect that you'd be
so useless.

112
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,280
I can't believe a concubine

113
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,880
took away your authority as the matron.

114
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,280
I'm useless.

115
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,800
I've disappointed you.

116
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,600
Mother.

117
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,880
Concubine Qiao

118
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,600
married into the Xu family
a year earlier than Shiyi.

119
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
And she's the niece

120
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,160
of Great Madam Xu.

121
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
If Shiyi wants to get

122
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,840
the trust of the Xu family,

123
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,880
it will require some time.

124
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
After you get back,

125
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,720
you must listen

126
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,000
to Nanny Tao more.

127
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
You must take back the authority

128
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,560
of managing the household affairs.

129
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,200
If you let Concubine Qiao

130
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,360
walk all over you,

131
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
once she gives birth to a son,

132
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,280
you think she'll tolerate you?

133
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,840
When that time comes,

134
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,080
forget the authority of the matron,

135
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
you won't even be able to keep

136
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,600
the title of the matron.

137
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,040
Yes.

138
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll surely listen to your instructions.

139
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,720
I'll surely be careful with my words
and actions.

140
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,520
What's the use of being careful?

141
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,280
In the competition between wives,
strike first and gain an advantage,

142
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
strike last and be at a disadvantage.

143
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,880
Your Ladyship.

144
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,760
Lady Wuniang

145
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
and Lady Erniang have arrived.

146
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,760
-Greetings, Mother.
-Greetings, Mother.

147
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,440
You all

148
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,920
seldom see each other.

149
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,400
I'll leave you to chat here.

150
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,320
Shiyi.

151
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
Remember what I said.

152
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

153
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
Mother, don't worry.

154
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,640
I'll surely listen to Nanny Tao more.

155
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
Shiyi.

156
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,320
Wuniang.

157
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
Erniang.

158
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Let me take a good look at you.

159
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,080
After being the wife of Marquis,

160
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
your style has changed.

161
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,440
Look, your clothing are so exquisite.

162
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
And look at your jewelry too.

163
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,280
Erniang, come and take a look.

164
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,160
I haven't seen

165
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,280
this kind of ring that Shiyi's wearing.

166
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,640
How can I compare to the glow
in your face

167
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
as someone who's favored so much?

168
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,000
You're so good with words.

169
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,360
How are you and the Marquis?

170
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,360
We're good.

171
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
That's good to hear.

172
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,440
Marquis, here.

173
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Shiyi.

174
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,200
Let the Marquis

175
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,120
try Huaiyang cuisine

176
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,920
and the taste of Yuhang.

177
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
This is Songhua fish.

178
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,840
Have a try, My Lord.

179
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,800
I'll try it.

180
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
Erniang, what's the matter?

181
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,160
When Yuanniang was still alive,
her favorite

182
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,760
was braised pork balls.

183
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,240
I suddenly remembered Yuanniang.

184
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,240
Marquis, Shiyi.

185
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,320
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,800
I wasn't able to hold it in.

187
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,640
Here.

188
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Let me get you something.

189
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,880
When Concubine Lv was alive, she said

190
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,400
that your favorite is lotus root
with glutinous rice.

191
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,240
I was careless.

193
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,880
It's fine.

194
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,960
When you were with me,

195
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,560
I taught you

196
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,080
that if the husband doesn't have
good virtues,

197
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,000
he won't be able to handle his wife.

198
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,440
If the wife isn't virtuous,

199
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,200
she won't be able to serve
her husband.

200
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
As the matron,

201
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,400
you should be careful

202
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
and set an example.

203
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,800
If you're this clumsy

204
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,200
and crude,

205
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,520
how can you take the responsibility
of being the matron?

206
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
No wonder the family you married into
doesn't trust you.

207
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,680
Mother-in-law, don't worry.

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,760
Shiyi is gentle, modest,

209
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,960
decent, and has good taste.

210
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
Everyone in the family likes her.

211
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,680
Even if she makes a mistake,

212
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,360
my mother will guide her.

213
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,760
Mother.

214
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,520
Since yesterday, we've been
starving ourselves

215
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,840
for this meal.

216
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,560
Our stomachs are growling.

217
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,120
If we go on chatting,

218
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
we can't take it anymore.

219
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,880
What are you waiting for?

220
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

221
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,960
Don't just sit there, eat.

222
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,880
Let's eat.

223
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,320
If you really mind that Lianfang

224
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,280
is managing household affairs at home,

225
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,920
why didn't you mention it?

226
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,880
You think

227
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,600
that I told my mother about it?

228
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,800
Many things

229
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,640
can be resolved through discussions.

230
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,680
Why do you all like

231
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,040
to do things in secret?

232
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
You all?

233
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,120
Aside from me,

234
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
you're referring

235
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,760
to Yuanniang?

236
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,320
Just comment about me.

237
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,520
Yuanniang has already passed away
for so long.

238
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm afraid it's not appropriate

239
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,480
for you to say that.

240
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,207
(Mansion of Xu)

241
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,976
(A great man brings glory to a place)

242
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,760
I still have work to do
at the government office.

243
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
You can go inside.

244
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
My Lord, you're mistaken.

245
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,080
Today, there's no...

246
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,560
Please go ahead, My Lord.

247
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,419
(Official should have
a good sense of justice and fairness.)

248
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,520
My Lord, it was my mistake.

249
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,120
My Lord.

250
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,800
This one's good.

251
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,600
No.

252
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You weren't aware.

253
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,920
My Lord.

254
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,720
My Lord.

255
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,200
My Lord.

256
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,840
My Lord, I really know
that I was wrong.

257
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,960
My Lord.

258
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Are you ready?

259
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,639
I...

260
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,440
General.

261
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:45,760
General, save me!

262
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:46,800
General.

263
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,760
My Lord.

264
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,080
It's a bit unfair indeed.

265
00:18:58,399 --> 00:18:59,159
My Lord.

266
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,240
Shadow is ready.

267
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,119
You can start now.

268
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Come on.

269
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,720
Since he was little,

270
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,760
that's the only technique he knows.

271
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,600
It's a shame that he's not a point man.

272
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,880
My Lord.

273
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,360
Aren't you supposed to go
to your bride's home today?

274
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
Why did you come
to the government office?

275
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,960
Should I ask

276
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
for your instructions
in what I should do?

277
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm just concerned about you, all right?

278
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,280
How is your new wife?

279
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,800
She's sharp-tongued
and extremely audacious.

280
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,680
This is the first time
that I've heard you comment

281
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,080
about a woman this way.

282
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,760
It seems like your new wife
is a character.

283
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,280
When have I ever commented
about a woman?

284
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,680
Last time at the port,

285
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,200
you mentioned
Imperial Censor Liu's daughter.

286
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,760
You said that at 18,

287
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,520
she's educated, well-mannered,
and gorgeous.

288
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
What else did I say?

289
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,160
I'll stop, My Lord.

290
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,080
Don't go and find a wife for me.

291
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,320
I didn't want to get another wife.

292
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm just fulfilling my responsibility
as the head of household

293
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
and fulfilling Yuanniang's wish.

294
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
It's best if we can just

295
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,640
fulfill our responsibilities

296
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,080
and live together peacefully.

297
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
Dongqing, I want to change my clothing.

298
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,240
I'm going to bed.

299
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,520
Your Ladyship.

300
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,840
His Lordship isn't back yet.

301
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't you want to wait for him?

302
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,040
I don't think he'll be coming today.

303
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,840
Let's go to bed.

304
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,000
(Beautiful scenery and beautiful things)
My eldest brother

305
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
especially brought these pastries.

306
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Try it.

307
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,720
You can have some.

308
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,520
I heard from the servants

309
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,520
that after returning
from the Luo family,

310
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,880
His Lordship lost his fondness
of Her Ladyship.

311
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,520
He also didn't go to Western
Lateral Court last night.

312
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,040
He directly slept at Banyuepan.

313
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
His Lordship and the Luo family

314
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,400
must have had a disagreement.

315
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
I didn't expect

316
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,480
that Her Ladyship would lose favor
so quickly.

317
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,320
She's so weak.

318
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,760
She's so far off

319
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,040
from Yuanniang.

320
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,360
I think

321
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,200
Her Ladyship is quite kind.

322
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,680
Compared to the late Her Ladyship,
she's easier to get along with.

323
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,800
Powerless people

324
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,280
are all easy to get along with.

325
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,560
Try this. This one's good.

326
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,360
Mother, take good care of your eyes.

327
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,680
All right.

328
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,280
Lingyi.

329
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,480
You're always busy with work.

330
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,440
You finally have some free time.

331
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,200
Why did you come here?

332
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,920
Yi'er.

333
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,520
The entire Xu household

334
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,440
is relying on you.

335
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,760
You must go and visit them more.

336
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,360
To them,

337
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm just

338
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
something they can use to compete
for power and benefits.

339
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,080
Nonsense.

340
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,160
It's true that they compete
for your favor,

341
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,680
for they do care

342
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,320
about you.

343
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,240
To them,

344
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,760
you are the only one they can depend on.

345
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,760
You can't

346
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,120
treat them coldly forever.

347
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,440
Mother, don't worry.

348
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,160
I know what I should do.

349
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:25,960
♪The instrument's forlorn, piercing
sound is like the autumn breeze♪

350
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:33,600
♪Music comes from those slender
and gentle hands♪

351
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,560
♪The sorrowful melody produced♪

352
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,600
♪Surprised the swans
and geese in autumn♪

353
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,680
♪Bowing his head sometimes and frowning,
with looks of lingering♪

354
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:58,560
♪Together, creating new songs
and playing old ones♪

355
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,040
♪Under the moon by the window♪

356
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,640
♪The husband and wife love each other
like flowers from the same branch♪

357
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,720
♪Indulging in days of spring daily♪

358
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,840
♪Indulging in days of spring daily♪

359
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,520
My Lord.

360
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,360
Your music is beautiful.

361
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
It's very extraordinary.

362
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,320
There is a handsome man.

363
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,840
I couldn't forget him after meeting him.

364
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,960
Without seeing him for a day,

365
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,400
I miss him like crazy.

366
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
You probably doesn't remember.

367
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,240
We first met

368
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
at this garden.

369
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,680
You also played

370
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,360
"High Mountain and Flowing River".

371
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,120
Since that day,

372
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,760
I've secretly fallen for you.

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,320
I couldn't help myself.

374
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
Your music is strong and powerful,

375
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,760
while mine is melodious and soft.

376
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,960
We complement each other.

377
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,480
What if we take this chance

378
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
to play together?

379
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,200
If it's not convenient for you today,

380
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,160
next time,

381
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,200
can you give me some pointers?

382
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,760
What are you thinking about, My Lord?

383
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,680
Just some official business.

384
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,880
I'm willing to share your worries.

385
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,920
When I'm away in battles,

386
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
you're the one who's
taking care of mother.

387
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Thank you.

388
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,520
As your concubine,

389
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,840
it's part of my responsibility
to be filial.

390
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,440
I don't want anything.

391
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,960
When you have time,

392
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
I just hope

393
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,160
that you can visit me more often.

394
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Then I'll feel satisfied.

395
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,360
All right.

396
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,480
My...

397
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,040
Zhaoying.

398
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,040
Find a red musical score

399
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,680
from my box of books.

400
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,280
Red?

401
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,600
My Lord.

402
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,360
You haven't played for over ten years.

403
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Why did you think about that musical
score today?

404
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,480
Later,

405
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,160
bring it to Concubine Qiao.

406
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,440
Xiuyuan.

407
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,280
How is my makeup today?

408
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,120
Do I look nice?

409
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
You're strikingly beautiful.

410
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,280
Even without makeup,

411
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,960
you're more beautiful than the others.

412
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,480
Madam, don't worry.

413
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,600
You're so sweet.

414
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,760
Madam.

415
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,200
Where's His Lordship?

416
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,280
Madam.

417
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,840
His Lordship still has work to do.

418
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,720
He's resting in Banyuepan tonight,
as usual.

419
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,680
His Lordship told me to bring you
this musical score.

420
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
My goodness.

421
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,920
(The Spring Snow)
His Lordship wasted your effort.

422
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,164
(Integrity)

423
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,520
Madam.

424
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,600
It seems like

425
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,080
you've prepared a lot of dishes today.

426
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,360
They're not a lot.

427
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,480
His Lordship

428
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,680
will finally come to visit me.

429
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,080
I originally thought that after
the late Her Ladyship passed away,

430
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Concubine Qiao will gain the advantage.

431
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,760
I didn't expect
that she is same like us.

432
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,080
She has also been alone for over a year.

433
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,720
Now, Her Ladyship has lost favor.

434
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,520
I must grab this opportunity.

435
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800
You're putting in so much effort.

436
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,560
His Lordship will understand

437
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
how you feel.

438
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,240
Even if

439
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,880
the Wen family is prosperous,

440
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
to put it bluntly,

441
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,520
we're just merchants.

442
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,560
Only in getting His Lordship's favor

443
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,160
can we sustain our prosperity.

444
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,840
So no matter how hard I must try,

445
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,240
it will be worth it.

446
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,600
The Wen family was a big help

447
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,000
to the Xu family.

448
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,480
To His Lordship,

449
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,440
you're surely different from others.

450
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
You're right.

451
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,240
His Lordship is here.

452
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,786
(Good time pass by quickly)

453
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,933
My Lord, you are here.

454
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,000
My Lord.

455
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,080
My Lord, please have a sit.

456
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,560
My Lord, you always work so hard.

457
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,800
I've prepared ginseng chicken soup today

458
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,240
to nourish your health.

459
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,000
My Lord, drink it while it's hot.

460
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,040
Thank you.

461
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,080
My Lord, this ginseng chicken soup

462
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
is special.

463
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,720
The ginseng inside

464
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
is 100 years old.

465
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,680
When my eldest brother went
to Changbai Mountain

466
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,040
for business,

467
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,000
he spent

468
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,960
20 taels of silver for it.

469
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,160
He sent someone to bring it here

470
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,520
for you.

471
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
This soup

472
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,600
costs 20 taels of silver?

473
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
Not only 20.

474
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,720
In the soup,

475
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,040
I even added pine mushrooms
and deer antlers.

476
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,640
Together, they cost a fortune.

477
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,400
As long as you like it,

478
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,680
it's worth it no matter
how much money I spend.

479
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,880
I suddenly remembered

480
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,480
that I have urgent matters
to attend to.

481
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,600
Enjoy your meal.

482
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,360
I'll go ahead.

483
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,040
My Lord, you're leaving so soon?

484
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,280
You haven't tried

485
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,280
any of the dishes yet.

486
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,320
At least

487
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,600
drink this soup before leaving.

488
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,120
It's such an expensive soup.

489
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,320
I can't enjoy it.

490
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,520
Give it to Yu.

491
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,640
He's growing.

492
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,720
He needs these.

493
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,017
(Good time pass by quickly)

494
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,320
My Lord.

495
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,440
My... My Lord.

496
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,720
Try the new tea this year.

497
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,720
Great Madam

498
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,920
gave that to me some time ago.

499
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Do you think it's suitable

500
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,360
to hang it here?

501
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,240
The bamboo leaves are verdant.

502
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,640
The osmanthus is bright and beautiful.

503
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,960
And there are pretty kingfisher birds.

504
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,360
Hanging it here by the window,

505
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,680
it has a style of its own.

506
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,400
It has a different vibe.

507
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,320
Is this

508
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,320
Lin Chun's osmanthus, bamboo,
and kingfisher painting?

509
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,200
I think so.

510
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,400
I was organizing

511
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,640
some old things.

512
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,440
I don't know how I got these out.

513
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,160
I know that you feel sad,

514
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,320
but it's all in the past now.

515
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,400
After all these years,

516
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,120
you should move on.

517
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,960
I won't be able

518
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
to have my own child anymore.

519
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,040
How can I move on?

520
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,440
That's... That's not what I meant.

521
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,000
I understand.

522
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,720
I still have work to do.

523
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,400
Take good care

524
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,720
of yourself.

525
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,480
My Lord.

526
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,166
(Pay respect)

527
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,880
Go.

528
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
Go.

529
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,320
Stop, freeze!

530
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,440
(Marquis Yongping and his son)

531
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
(didn't do inspect clearly
and misjudged the enemy's situation,)

532
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,440
(causing heavy casualties
to our soldiers.)

533
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,880
(They were almost wiped out.)

534
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,680
(It pains me a lot.)

535
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,920
(His whole family will be killed.)

536
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,240
Mother.

537
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,440
Please let me find the killer soon.

538
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,520
My Lord.

539
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,239
My Lord, it's late.
Why aren't you in bed yet?

540
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:52,840
I can't sleep.

541
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,960
I came out to take a walk.

542
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,600
It's cold at night.

543
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,360
My Lord, you'd better

544
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,480
go and rest soon.

545
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,719
I'll go ahead.

546
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,840
Are you thinking of your mother?

547
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:14,480
If something's troubling you,

548
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,880
when it's quiet late at night,

549
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,360
sitting here for a while

550
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,279
will make you feel better.

551
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,120
Something's troubling you too?

552
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,320
Are you curious about it?

553
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,840
I just think

554
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
that if someone who has a high position
and who's powerful like you

555
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,280
wants something,

556
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,760
it will be easy for you
to accomplish it.

557
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,400
How can you have any worries?

558
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,680
If that's really the case,

559
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,400
you won't be here.

560
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,040
It seems like

561
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,560
you're still very concerned

562
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,200
about what happened
at the spring banquet.

563
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
I don't want

564
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,240
to talk about the past anymore.

565
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,800
So even if I tell you

566
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
that I don't intend to compete for the
authority to manage household affairs,

567
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,240
you won't believe me, right?

568
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,200
You don't want

569
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,720
the authority to manage
household affairs?

570
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,080
I think the goal is to manage it well.

571
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,000
It doesn't matter who manages it.

572
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,280
You see things clearly.

573
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,760
It seems like reading
in the warm partition

574
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,000
is useful.

575
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,320
I can't compare

576
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,800
to your insight and knowledge.

577
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,640
It's late.

578
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,960
Let's go.

579
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,240
I know what you're worried about now.

580
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,920
You overthink the situations

581
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,560
yet you're powerless to change anything.

582
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,247
(Yixin Pavilion)

583
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,800
Madam.

584
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,280
I just met

585
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,120
Dongqing, Her Ladyship's maid.

586
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,840
She said

587
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,760
that Her Ladyship wants to come
and visit you

588
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,960
and also discuss

589
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,800
the fan embroidery design.

590
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,480
She just married into the family,

591
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,160
and she's already busy
trying to get people's support.

592
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,480
But it's hard on her.

593
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,800
Who can be convinced

594
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,240
with an illegitimate daughter?

595
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,000
Concubine Qiao

596
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,600
has Great Madam's trust now,

597
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,040
and she is managing household affairs.

598
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,880
I'm afraid Her Ladyship

599
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,120
is anxious.

600
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,280
That's why she couldn't wait

601
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,080
but get your support.

602
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,680
Let's see

603
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,360
if she's capable of doing that.

604
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,440
However,

605
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,840
Concubine Qiao

606
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,480
thinks that because she's the legitimate daughter
of a prominent family.

607
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,400
She looks down

608
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,720
on the other concubines.

609
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm annoyed with that too.

610
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,280
Madam, Her Ladyship is here.

611
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,160
We were just talking about her.

612
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,960
Princess Dan Yang

613
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,480
Shiyi.

614
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,280
I'm pregnant, it's inconvenient for me
to stand up.

615
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,000
I hope you don't mind.

616
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,160
Please have a seat, Shiyi.

617
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,360
I came here today

618
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,360
to see

619
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,040
the embroidery items
that you usually like

620
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,680
as reference for the fan design.

621
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,800
You're putting so much effort

622
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,520
on such a trivial thing.

623
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,960
Xiaolan.

624
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,800
Yes.

625
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Dongqing.

626
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,760
Be careful not to let your nail damage
the embroidery item.

627
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
I'm being careful.

628
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,680
I know how to take care
of embroidery items

629
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,240
better than you.

630
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,400
(Even if these embroidery items
are exquisite,)

631
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,680
(regardless if it's the fabric)

632
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,160
(or the embroidery design,)

633
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,680
(they're very different from the one
my mom had.)

634
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,800
(It seems like I can't find)

635
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,440
(any clues here.)

636
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,800
I heard

637
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,560
that Your Ladyship has learned
from a famous master.

638
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,960
You're highly skilled in embroidery.

639
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,400
I wonder if you can recognize

640
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,840
where is that embroidery item from.

641
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,360
Suzhou embroidery is rarely seen.

642
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,320
The thread colors are all light.

643
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,680
It's composed yet lively.

644
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,120
In Hangzhou's Jifeng Hall,

645
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,480
I think there's an embroiderer
with the surname of Su.

646
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,080
This is her style.

647
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,360
My embroidery items

648
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,960
are all from Jifeng Hall

649
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I'm not used to others.

650
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,440
You don't need to make

651
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,200
a fan embroidery design for me.

652
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,760
In that case,

653
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,440
I won't disturb you any further.

654
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,600
Thank you for coming here.

655
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,720
I won't see you off.

656
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,320
Take a good rest then.

657
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,760
She's a bit knowledgeable.

658
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,480
You're working so meticulously

659
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,720
on the embroidery items for us.

660
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,680
I'm afraid it's not only for the purpose

661
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,000
of making fan embroidery designs, right?
