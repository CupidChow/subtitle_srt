Shiyi.

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,640
My Lord.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,800
Marquis Yongping.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
It's time to leave.

My Lord.

26

My Lord.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,640
I ran into

28
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,840
Ou Yanxing just now

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,400
and had a few words with him.

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
Please don't misunderstand.

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,200
Why did Erniang see you earlier?

32
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
I don't know why

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,320
but she's certain

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,160
that it's Duke Wei
who asked his concierge

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
to kill Wang Yu.

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
She hopes that you

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
can report this to His Majesty

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
and ask for a thorough investigation.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
What did you say?

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,920
I refused, of course.

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,200
The truth is still unknown.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm sure you've already had a plan.

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,600
I can't meddle in your business

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
just because of personal reasons.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,760
Tell her not to worry.

46
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,840
She's your sister.

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
I won't turn

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,920
a blind eye to this thing.

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,360
Thank you, My Lord.

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,880
By the way,

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,680
when I chatted with

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Mr. Ou today,

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
he said something strange.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,520
What did he say?

55
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,200
He said

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,120
Wang Yu's death

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,040
isn't as simple as it appears to be.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm wondering

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
if he knew something.

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,840
His source is from the Ou family.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Would the Ou family

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,840
have something to do
with Wang Yu's death?

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
There's one thing
you need to know clearly.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,880
No matter how he was like before,

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,510
since Ou Yanxing went

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,800
to Duke Mao's Mansion,

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,680
it means

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,920
he already started helping

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,880
with the household affairs.

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,720
You still want to believe him?

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,760
My Lord,

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,960
I understand your concern.

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,400
But Ou Yanxing

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,600
is not a bad person.

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,080
I know

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,480
that the Ou family
and the Xu family are enemies,

77
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,080
so I don't

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,400
talk to him in private anymore.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,160
And in public,

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,880
I'll also keep a distance with him.

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,640
My Lord,

82
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
do you trust me?

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,160
Young Madam,

84
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,560
do you think Lady Shiyi

85
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,880
will help us?

86
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
If she doesn't,

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,040
His Lordship will actually adopt

88
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,080
a son

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,360
to be his successor.

90
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,240
In that case, Young Madam,

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,640
what are you going to do?

92
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Remember to set the tables carefully.

93
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,080
Yes.

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
It's such a refreshed smell.

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,360
The Madams will like it.

96
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:32,580
(Mansion of Xu)

97
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,180
(A fair place
produces outstanding people.)

98
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,760
Hurry up.

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
The guests will be here soon.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,480
Mother, you look radiant today.

101
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,760
I'm sure you'll stand out

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,600
among those Madams

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,960
and Ladies.

104
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,920
You are making fun of me again.

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,080
Great Madam, bad news.

106
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Today, we can catch up with each other.

107
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,560
That's right.

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,880
Who's that?

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,360
Isn't that Young Madam Wang?

110
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,960
Why is she dressed up like that

111
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,840
and kneeling here?

112
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,840
Let's go take a look.

113
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Madam Tang.

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,360
Young Madam Wang.

115
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,040
What are you doing here?

116
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
Young Madam Wang,

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,920
I know you are sad

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,360
that your husband is dead.

119
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,960
But this is Mansion of Xu.

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,720
Your sister

121
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,200
is the matron of the house.

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,000
It's not proper for you to kneel here.

123
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,320
Why don't you get up

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,760
and tell us what's going on?

125
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Great Madam Zheng, Madam Tang,

126
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,200
Madam Gan, you are here.

127
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Great Madam Xu.

128
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,960
Sorry I came late to welcome you.

129
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Isn't this Young Madam Wang?

130
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,360
Young Madam Wang,

131
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,120
what are you doing?

132
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,960
Please get up.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,160
I didn't know you were coming.

134
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,800
We are very busy today.

135
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,600
If there's anything,

136
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,800
you can talk to the Second Madam first.

137
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
Yizhen,

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,040
take good care of Young Madam Wang.

139
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,920
Great Madam Zheng,

140
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,600
Madam Gan, Madam Tang,

141
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,480
let's go inside.

142
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,320
-Okay.
-Okay.

143
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,560
The Xu family have so many guests,

144
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,720
yet our Wang family

145
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,280
is desolate

146
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,680
and isolated.

147
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
Erniang,

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
what are you doing?

149
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,560
Get up.

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Shiyi,

151
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,880
you are finally willing to see me.

152
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,640
If you have something to say,

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,680
let's go inside first.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,560
No.

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
I'll say it right here.

156
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
Your brother-in-law had a violent death,

157
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,920
but you don't even want to help me.

158
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,080
I'll let everybody know

159
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,040
that you

160
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
don't care about your sister at all.

161
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,440
If I can help,

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,560
I of course will.

163
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,480
Just get up first

164
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,680
and let's talk.

165
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,280
Mother.

166
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm sure there's a misunderstanding

167
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,760
between Erniang and Shiyi.

168
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,640
Why don't we let them

169
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,920
sort it out here.

170
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,360
Let's invite our guests in

171
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
and have some tea first.

172
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,200
Here. Madams, please.

173
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,440
Great Madam.

174
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,040
Great Madam.

175
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,080
My husband was murdered.

176
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,520
But my sister
wants nothing to do with it.

177
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,120
I have no other choice,

178
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
so I'm here to beg you

179
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,360
to help me, Great Madam.

180
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,760
Young Madam Wang,

181
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,040
you are the Young Madam
of the Wang family,

182
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,080
how can I help you?

183
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,400
Great Madam,

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
you can't say that.

185
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,760
Though I'm the Young Madam
of the Wang family,

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm still Shiyi's sister.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,920
We are in-laws.

188
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Erniang.

189
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,440
It's Ren Kun who

190
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
asked his concierge to kill my husband.

191
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,000
But the Censorate

192
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,920
only arrested that concierge
and closed the case.

193
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,760
It's not fair to my husband.

194
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,360
I only want to find justice.

195
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
I have no other choice.

196
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
I can only ask Marquis Yongping
to report this to His Majesty

197
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
so that the Censorate will investigate

198
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,400
the case impartially.

199
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,360
But when my sister

200
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,680
heard that it might offend Ren Kun,

201
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
she refused immediately.

202
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,680
Great Madam,

203
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,120
I really have no other choice now.

204
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,880
And I don't care about
my dignity anymore.

205
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,840
It's ridiculous.

206
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,240
Investigating the case
is the Censorate's job.

207
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Lingyi isn't even a Censor.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,480
How can he interfere
in the case investigation?

209
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
Besides,

210
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,520
our Xu family will never

211
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,360
violate the law.

212
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Erniang,

213
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,080
it's not

214
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,520
the Xu family's place
to be a part of it.

215
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,640
I understand your feelings.

216
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,600
But don't be so stubborn

217
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,640
because you are

218
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,560
overwhelmed by your grief.

219
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
How dare you make light of it again?

220
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,000
It's a sure thing that Ren Kun

221
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,440
is behind Wang Yu's death.

222
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,840
You Xu family

223
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,960
know that he's the murderer,

224
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
yet you refuse to help me.

225
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,760
It must be because you need his favor

226
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,320
and you dare not offend him.

227
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,600
That's why you cover for him.

228
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,600
Young Madam Wang,
be careful about what you say.

229
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,000
Great Madam Xu,

230
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,280
given the situation,

231
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,320
I think

232
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,480
your family matter is more important.

233
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,240
That's right.

234
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,320
Why don't we get together
some other time?

235
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
That's right.

236
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
Let's get together another time.

237
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,520
Great Madam Zheng,
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

238
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,760
I'm really sorry.

239
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,760
Madam Tang.

240
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,400
We'll take our leave.

241
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
We'll leave now.

242
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,240
Let's go.

243
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,920
Let's go.

244
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,880
Great Madam. Great Madam.

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,760
-Great Madam.
-Erniang.

246
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,720
Don't be so cruel.

247
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,600
Please help me.

248
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,600
Erniang.

249
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
Let go.

250
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
If you have a grievance,

251
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,200
you should go to
the Censorate for justice.

252
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,120
Yet you came to the Xu family
and made a scene.

253
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,520
You think your groundless accusation

254
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,280
will make His Lordship

255
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,160
slander Duke Wei

256
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,720
and question the Censorate's job?

257
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,400
How could you benefit

258
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,720
from a falling-out like this?

259
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,120
I've lost everything anyway.

260
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,880
I have no fear.

261
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
You all bully the weak
and fear the strong.

262
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,880
You must be up to something.

263
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,480
Let me tell you.

264
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,640
If the Xu family don't help me,

265
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,040
you'll never get peace.

266
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,320
Great Madam,

267
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
our Wang family and the Luo family
are connected through marriage.

268
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,240
So are the Xu family
and the Jiang family.

269
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,040
We did this

270
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,360
so that we can help each other

271
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,920
if anyone is in trouble.

272
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,800
We only ask Marquis

273
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,720
to speak a few words
for us in the court.

274
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
He won't even do that?

275
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,440
The marriage alliance is indeed

276
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,880
for uniting the power of our families.

277
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
But a country has its law.

278
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,280
Everything should be done
according to the law.

279
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,240
Helping each other is good,

280
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,120
but it can't go beyond the law

281
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
or offend His Majesty.

282
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,440
I see

283
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,840
what you are saying now.

284
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
When Yuanniang was alive,

285
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm the one who

286
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,280
made the betrothal for Zhun.

287
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,720
But Marquis Yongping

288
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,880
doesn't even care about
my brother's death.

289
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,560
He's so heartless.

290
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm really worried

291
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,760
what kind of situation
the Jiang family's child

292
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,920
will be in after marrying into

293
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,880
your Xu family.

294
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,480
Great Madam,

295
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,160
don't get mad.

296
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,920
Wang Yu

297
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
was Young Madam Jiang's brother,

298
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,520
and Duke Mao's only son.

299
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
I understand why

300
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,840
the Wang family is being desperate.

301
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,240
But our Xu family

302
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,360
can never neglect the law
for personal interests.

303
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,360
I won't let Lingyi

304
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,760
break that rule.

305
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
That's right.

306
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,100
(Residence of Luo)

307
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,200
I don't mean to meddle
in Marquis's business.

308
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,400
But you need to remember

309
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,960
that you are the matron
of the Xu family,

310
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,280
as well as the daughter
of the Luo family.

311
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,800
If Zhun's betrothal

312
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,080
is affected by this,

313
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
the Luo family

314
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,960
will not forgive you.

315
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,520
It was supposed to be a happy feast.

316
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,240
And now it's all ruined.

317
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
What do I smell?

318
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
It smells so refreshing.

319
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,840
Great Madam,

320
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,240
it's dipterocarpaceae.

321
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Her Ladyship said

322
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,280
it's the blooming season
for oleaceae flowers,

323
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,760
so using dipterocarpaceae
would be the best.

324
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I heard

325
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,600
that Shiyi also prepared

326
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,520
high-class Silver Needle tea

327
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,040
and invited a zither player

328
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,640
to play
White Snow in the Spring Sunlight

329
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,160
as background music.

330
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,840
Shiyi really did her best

331
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,680
to make it a happy day for you, Mother.

332
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,240
I will appreciate her more

333
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,160
if she doesn't make

334
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
our Xu family humiliated

335
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,800
every now and then.

336
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,360
Actually, Shiyi

337
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,080
is a virtuous and talented woman.

338
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,360
She's just a little inexperienced
since she hasn't

339
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,560
managed the household long enough.

340
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
Mother, if you are willing to guide her,

341
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,960
you'll not need to worry in the future.

342
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,960
You are defending her again.

343
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
Mother, Yizhen.

344
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,280
Mother.

345
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,320
About what happened earlier,

346
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,880
it's my fault
that I didn't handle it well.

347
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
Sorry that I disappointed you.

348
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,920
Shiyi.

349
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,800
It's not easy to be

350
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,920
the matron of the house.

351
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,600
Not only do you have to take care

352
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,080
of all the household affairs,

353
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,350
you also need to
deal with relationships with others.

354
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,760
There must be

355
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,800
a reason that your sister

356
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,110
acted like that.

357
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,960
If you can't find it out,

358
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,070
it'll be hard to find a solution.

359
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,830
You should think about

360
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,800
how to balance between your relationship

361
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
with your sister
and your responsibility as

362
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,680
the matron of the house.

363
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,560
That's where you should use your wisdom.

364
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,480
Thank you for your advice, Mother.

365
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Dear, thank you.

366
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,320
Wang Yu has done so many bad things

367
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,480
and was abhorred by people.

368
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,440
His death

369
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,000
is considered a good thing.

370
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,360
Duke Mao has been
out of the court for long.

371
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,600
He has no proof suggesting Ren Kun

372
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,720
is the murderer.

373
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,760
Even if he does,

374
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,480
the Censorate wouldn't arrest Ren Kun

375
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,680
for Wang Yu.

376
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,280
After Luo Erniang
made a scene in the Xu family,

377
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,400
no matter Xu Lingyi

378
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,920
will help her or not,

379
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,400
rebellious

380
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,280
as Ren Kun is, he wouldn't want people

381
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
to think that he's protected by anybody.

382
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,600
So he will definitely

383
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,800
steer clear of Xu Lingyi.

384
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,920
Duke Wei refuted me

385
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
in the court today.

386
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,160
Looks like he doesn't

387
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,960
want to remain neutral any longer.

388
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,840
He also claimed that
he's done nothing wrong

389
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,160
and he didn't need anybody's protection.

390
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,240
I think

391
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,120
what he said was intended for you.

392
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,280
I believe that he has nothing to do

393
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,200
with Wang Yu's death.

394
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,440
But to avoid arousing suspicion,

395
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,200
he wants to use the sea ban
to make a clean break with me.

396
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,160
In that case,

397
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,680
the situation will be unfavorable to us.

398
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
Wang Yu's case is quite complicated.

399
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,280
Have you thought about

400
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,000
investigating it in secret?

401
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,120
Dear,

402
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,800
you can

403
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,000
relax now.

404
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
The one who helped me to do that

405
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
is a relative of mine,

406
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,480
named Zhou Xian.

407
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,560
He's very loyal to me,

408
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
and very reliable.

409
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,520
Even if Xu Lingyi
is going to investigate it,

410
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,960
I don't think he can find out anything.

411
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,680
I'm not afraid of his investigation.

412
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,680
The Censorate has decided
to minimize the case

413
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,520
and identified

414
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,800
the concierge as the murderer.

415
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,040
If Xu Lingyi dares to interfere in it,

416
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll make it difficult
for him to back down.

417
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
By then, besides Ren Kun,

418
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,640
the Censorate, the Jiang family
and the Wang family

419
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,000
will all see him as an enemy.

420
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,480
You are indeed wise.

421
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Dear,

422
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,920
just sit tight and enjoy the show.

423
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,240
By the way,

424
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,240
don't forget to ask

425
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,920
Zhou Xian to leave the capital.

426
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,840
I know.

427
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
Your Ladyship.

428
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
Madam Xu is back.

429
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,840
I'll take my leave now.

430
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,320
Alright.

431
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
Then let's talk about

432
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,360
Duke Wei's matter later.

433
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,680
See you.

434
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,840
My Lord.

435
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm sorry

436
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
to put you through this.

437
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,040
No need to blame yourself.

438
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,120
Actually, it's me
who caused you the trouble.

439
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,360
Actually there's more to this thing.

440
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
There's more?

441
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,120
The cause of this thing

442
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,560
is the conflict between Wang Yu

443
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
and Duke Wei's adopted daughter.

444
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,400
And their conflict

445
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,760
was caused by the Ou family.

446
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,560
I suspect

447
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,160
that the Ou family have something

448
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,840
to do with Wang Yu's death.

449
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
And after Erniang made a scene,

450
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,640
our Xu family is caught between
a rock and a hard place now.

451
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,320
If we don't handle it properly,

452
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,880
the Luo, Wang, Ren and Jiang families

453
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,800
will all see us as their enemy.

454
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,440
And it'll eventually affect the sea ban.

455
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,600
The Ou family started it,

456
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,000
and they'll benefit from it.

457
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,760
Considering

458
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,280
what Mr. Ou said earlier,

459
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,240
could the Ou family

460
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
be the murderer of Wang Yu?

461
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,800
It's possible.

462
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,240
But we don't have any evidence,

463
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,360
and I have no right to interfere

464
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,720
in the Censorate's investigation.

465
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,480
I can only try my best

466
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,960
to calm the situation

467
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,680
and minimize the damage it has caused

468
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,800
to our Xu family.

469
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,480
My Lord.

470
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,760
Is there anything I can do?

471
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,520
I want you to move
to the villa for a few days

472
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,240
to stay away from the trouble.

473
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,360
I can't go.

474
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,360
If you stay here,

475
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,560
Erniang will cause you more trouble.

476
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,600
It won't make things any better.

477
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,680
I know you care about me.

478
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,120
But if I come forward

479
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
to solve this problem,

480
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,280
whatever the outcome,

481
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,800
it only matters to my own reputation.

482
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
If you do it instead of me,

483
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,680
the others will accuse you

484
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,280
of bending the law
for your personal gain,

485
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,560
which is exactly
what the Ou family want.

486
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,720
But Erniang

487
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,240
won't let it go easily.

488
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
I can't just watch you

489
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
being pulled

490
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
into a dilemma.

491
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
My Lord, don't underestimate me.

492
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
If Erniang comes to make trouble again,

493
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,320
I have a way to deal with her.

494
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,040
What's your plan?

495
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,320
A solution can be found

496
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,760
when you locate the real problem.

497
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
My Lord, just rest assured.

498
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,120
My Lord.

499
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,760
Give this letter

500
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,160
to Imperial Censor Li.

501
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,400
Yes, My Lord.

502
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,860
(Duke Mao's Mansion)

503
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,360
I didn't expect that the kneeling

504
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
really worked.

505
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,120
And now,

506
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,520
Ren Kun has turned against Xu Lingyi.

507
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm sure the Xu family
is having a hard time right now.

508
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
I just feel sorry for your sister Shiyi.

509
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,720
Because of this,

510
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,360
she made the Xu family humiliated,

511
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,240
and also ruined

512
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,680
Zhun's betrothal.

513
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,400
Great Madam Xu

514
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,720
and Madam Luo both blamed her.

515
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,040
I'm afraid she was also criticized

516
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,720
by her husband.

517
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,040
She deserves it.

518
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520
She is cruel and heartless.

519
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,080
She only thinks of herself

520
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,440
and never cares about me.

521
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,640
What's wrong?

522
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,440
I've been under the weather

523
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,320
since the miscarriage.

524
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,960
And I knelt

525
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,120
for two hours that day

526
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,680
outside of Mansion of Xu.

527
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,200
I've been having

528
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,320
crampy pain in lower abdomen
since I got back.

529
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,280
Erniang,

530
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,000
you've got to
take good care of yourself.

531
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,920
You need to be

532
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,840
more careful in the future.

533
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,640
I will.

534
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,480
Actually, I do

535
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,680
understand your feelings.

536
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,120
You will get
your health back eventually.

537
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,680
But if you fail in dealing

538
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,040
with the adoption thing,

539
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
your life

540
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,520
will be very difficult in the future.

541
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,080
You are the one

542
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,240
who understands me the most now.

543
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,080
I have

544
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,760
no other choice

545
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,200
but to burn the bridge.

546
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,660
(Mansion of Xu)

547
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,240
Erniang is here again.

548
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,440
She's kneeling right outside

549
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,360
in the heavy rain.

550
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,480
What does she want exactly?

551
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,280
If it goes on like this,

552
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,320
the rumor will spread

553
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,800
and everybody will believe it's true.

554
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,560
I think she's doing it

555
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,000
on purpose to have it in for you.

556
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,880
Let me take a look.

557
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,720
Amber.

558
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,520
Erniang.

559
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,920
Is it necessary?

560
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,320
You just had a miscarriage.

561
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,080
Why are you

562
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,320
doing this to yourself?

563
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,280
Please get up.

564
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,440
Let's go inside and talk.

565
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,920
I won't leave

566
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,920
unless you say yes.

567
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,440
I've made my point very clearly.

568
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Fine.

569
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
Then let's wait and see.

570
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,200
Wait till my body gives up,

571
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,720
wait till the whole city

572
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,720
thinks your Xu family

573
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,920
will ruthlessly

574
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,760
force me to die,

575
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,280
I'll see

576
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,360
how you can still calmly

577
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,080
hold your position
as the Marquis Yongping's wife.

578
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,600
I'll make your life

579
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,280
as miserable as mine.

580
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,760
Let me ask you one more time.

581
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,600
Will you go inside with me

582
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,120
and talk this thing out?

583
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,000
I'll leave

584
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,880
as soon as Xu Lingyi

585
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,760
agrees to help me.

586
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,920
Otherwise, I'll drag you down

587
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,200
together with me.

588
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,320
Then I have nothing more to say.

589
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,240
Don't pretend to be nice.

590
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,420
(Mansion of Xu)

591
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,320
Over here.

592
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,120
It's her.

593
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,000
She's Wang Yu's wife.

594
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,600
It is her.

595
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,000
It's hard to find her usually.

596
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Young Madam.

597
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,960
We finally see her today.

598
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,760
-It's her. It is her.
-It is.

599
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,240
Who are you?

600
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,800
Give my sister back.

601
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,520
What are you doing?

602
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,480
Wang Yu

603
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,920
killed my daughter.

604
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
You are his wife.

605
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,880
You've got

606
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
to be responsible for his crime.

607
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,280
You've got

608
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,200
to be responsible
for my daughter's death.

609
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,040
-That's right.
-You must.

610
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,280
Who are you?

611
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,080
My nephew sold himself to your family.

612
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,640
Let go of me.

613
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,880
But Wang Yu actually

614
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
beat him to death.

615
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,920
And my sister

616
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
was also killed by him.

617
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Give my sister back.

618
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,120
Give my nephew back.

619
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,600
Give...

620
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,240
Give my sister back.

621
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,800
Let go of me.

622
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,080
You've got to be responsible for it.

623
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,880
I had nothing to do with it.

624
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,200
My poor nephew.

625
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,280
Young Madam.

626
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,920
Don't touch me.

627
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,880
Don't go.

628
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,640
Don't you leave today.

629
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,320
-Give my daughter back.
-Don't go.

630
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,960
(Mansion of Xu)
Young Madam.

631
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,520
Don't run.

632
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,080
I need an explanation.

633
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
-Please hold on.
-Give my daughter back.

634
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,520
Since she came to Mansion of Xu,

635
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,880
she's our guest.

636
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,600
If you have a dispute with her,

637
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,520
you can talk to her after she leaves.

638
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,280
Okay?

639
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,280
Alright.

640
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,560
Then we'll wait here.

641
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,560
We'll see

642
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,600
how long she can hide.

643
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,080
That's right. We won't leave.

644
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,000
We'll wait right here.

645
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,880
Be honest.

646
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,880
Are you the one
who called those people over?

647
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,560
You've seen the situation outside.

648
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,080
Their relatives

649
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,560
were killed by Wang Yu.

650
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,480
They have nowhere to find justice.

651
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,440
So they will be all over you

652
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,800
whenever they see you.

653
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,800
If you keep doing this,

654
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
you won't get what you want.

655
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,680
Instead, you will put

656
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,080
yourself in trouble.

657
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,120
I see.

658
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,960
Instead of helping me,

659
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,160
you pulled such a trick

660
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,120
to hurt me.

661
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,600
Since you want me to be dead,

662
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,320
I'll kill you first.

663
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,880
Stop this madness.

664
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,400
Will you calm down?

665
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,000
Wang Yu did all kinds of evil
when he was alive.

666
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,520
As his wife,

667
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,840
you should do something

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
to compensate the victims' families.

669
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,280
Erniang,

670
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,280
actually, you don't care

671
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,160
about who's the real murderer at all.

672
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,040
You just want

673
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,600
to get what Duke Mao needs

674
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,240
so that you can

675
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,040
live in wealth
for the rest of your life,

676
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,520
and you can take revenge on me.

677
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,560
Right?

678
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,000
You are enjoying

679
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
a life that is supposed to be mine.

680
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,440
How dare

681
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,960
you be this smug

682
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,680
and despise me?

683
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,600
Shouldn't

684
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,400
I hate you?

685
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,560
Luo Erniang.

686
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,080
Wake up.

687
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,160
Will you stop

688
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,280
deluding yourself?

689
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,280
We are both illegitimate daughters.

690
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,200
We both have no right to choose.

691
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,680
No matter which path we are on,

692
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
we have to face it bravely.

693
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,760
Will you pull yourself together?

694
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,320
You are Marquis Yongping's wife.

695
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,120
Of course it's easy for you

696
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,360
to say those big words.

697
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,600
You have no idea

698
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,120
what kind of life

699
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,280
I'm living right now.

700
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,120
Just go back

701
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,920
and take care of your health.

702
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,440
His Lordship and I

703
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,080
will figure out a way

704
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,360
and help you with the adoption.

705
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,040
But if you come to make trouble again,

706
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,880
you'll be the one who gets humiliated,

707
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,000
not me.

708
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,360
Dongqing.

709
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,720
Go and get a carriage.

710
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,360
Send Young Madam Wang back

711
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,800
from the back door.

712
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,840
Yes, Your Ladyship.

713
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,120
Remember to put a stove in the carriage.

714
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,360
Shiyi.

715
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
You'd better keep your word.

716
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,120
Otherwise,

717
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,640
I won't let you off.

718
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,720
What's the matter with you?

719
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
We asked you to
seek for help from the Xu family,

720
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
yet you aroused so much gossip.

721
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,840
Who gave you the right

722
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,160
to destroy our Wang family's

723
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
reputation like this?

724
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,080
It's such a bad luck for our family.

725
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,600
My brother was killed for no reason.

726
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,480
My sister-in-law went to seek justice,

727
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,360
yet made people all gossip
about us in the end.

728
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,200
Young Madam.

729
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,360
Young Madam.

730
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,760
-Erniang.
-Young Madam.

731
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Hurry.

732
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,280
Help Erniang
to get back to her room.

733
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,640
Go and get a physician.

734
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,560
Yes.

735
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,040
It's a complication

736
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
of the miscarriage.

737
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,920
Besides, Young Madam caught a cold,

738
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,160
causing blood deficiency.

739
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,800
She has to take medicine
for a long time.

740
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,960
Otherwise, her life will be in danger.

741
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,400
This is the prescription.

742
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,720
Please get the herbs accordingly.

743
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,860
(Prescription: ginseng, lucid ganoderma,
angelica sinensis, etc.)

744
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,360
There are ginseng

745
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
and lucid ganoderma.

746
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,360
Looks like it's a serious illness.

747
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,600
Mother wants you

748
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,000
to take a good rest.

749
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,720
The household affairs

750
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,280
will be taken care of by Lady Wang-Liu.

751
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,160
Lady Wang-Liu?

752
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,720
Come in.

753
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Young Madam Jiang.

754
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
Young Madam.

755
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,400
The child that father wants to adopt

756
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,720
is hers.

757
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,200
She is a capable woman.

758
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,960
She can help you in the future.

759
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,040
Thank you for your trust,
Young Madam Jiang.

760
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,520
Young Madam.

761
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,840
Please take a good rest.

762
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Just leave

763
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,280
the household affairs to me.

764
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,360
Let her rest.

765
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,960
We are leaving.

766
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,800
Here.

767
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,440
I brought you another barrel of water.

768
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,400
Here.

769
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,440
Thanks to Lingkuan's help,

770
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,320
I sent Erniang away
successfully this time.

771
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,680
Otherwise, I really didn't know
how to deal with it.

772
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,240
Really?

773
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,000
Lingkuan, how did you help?

774
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,920
Those people

775
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,560
who went to Erniang for justice

776
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,440
were found by Lingkuan.

777
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,440
Although Lingkuan

778
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,400
appears to be

779
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,760
an idle person,

780
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,520
it's

781
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,640
actually helpful

782
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
to know those street people.

783
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,120
They helped us in the most

784
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,080
unexpected situation.

785
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,760
That Wang Yu

786
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,120
did all kinds of evil.

787
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,040
It's not difficult

788
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,230
at all to find

789
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,440
the victims' families.

790
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,760
And afterwards,

791
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,150
according to what Shiyi told me,

792
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,880
I gave some money

793
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,630
to the victims' families

794
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,150
for compensation

795
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
in the name of the Wang family.

796
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,320
I'm sure

797
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,400
they won't cause any trouble

798
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,960
to Young Madam Wang anymore.

799
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,520
Good.

800
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,320
It's a smart move

801
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,080
and a kind deed.

802
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,840
Well done.

803
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,710
What I did

804
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,080
isn't worth mentioning.

805
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm nothing compared

806
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,440
to Lingyi.

807
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,920
Kuan'er,

808
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,400
no need to belittle yourself.

809
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,280
You and Lingyi always

810
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,480
help and need

811
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,840
each other.

812
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,080
Because of you two,

813
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,880
our Xu family are never afraid

814
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,280
of any threat from outside.

815
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,680
Since Mother and you guys

816
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,000
all think highly of me,

817
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,400
I'll eat more tonight.

818
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,960
Look at you.

819
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,320
Shiyi,

820
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,040
Lingyi has told me everything.

821
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,360
This thing is quite complicated

822
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,760
and hard to deal with,

823
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,200
but you properly handled it

824
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,520
and you didn't let me down.

825
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,160
Thank you, Mother, for your trust.

826
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,640
Erniang

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,520
caused a big mess this time.

828
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,840
But I know

829
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,920
you still care about her.

830
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,400
Go and visit her more.

831
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,160
She's a poor woman.

832
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,840
Her life must be hard

833
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,040
in such a big family.

834
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,720
If she

835
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
needs help in the future,

836
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,000
try your best to help her.

837
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,360
Thank you, Mother.

838
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,840
Father doesn't care about
the household affairs.

839
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,560
And mother has fallen ill.

840
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,560
There's no one we can rely on.

841
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,600
We can only ask someone else for help.

842
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,680
In fact,

843
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,760
Lady Shiyi

844
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,440
has sent people over for several times.

845
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,720
She still cares about you

846
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,600
very much.

847
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,920
But you always refused

848
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
to see her.

849
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,200
Why don't we...

850
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,600
She is hypocritical.

851
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,040
How could she be willing to help us?

852
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,360
She'll only laugh at us.

853
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,320
Then

854
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
who else can we go to for help?

855
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,600
A good friend is better than family.

856
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,400
Young Madam Ou is my best friend.

857
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,600
Her husband

858
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,480
and her parents

859
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,040
are all people with power.

860
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,200
They'll

861
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,040
be able to deal with those snobs.

862
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
Now,

863
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,640
I'll write a letter.

864
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,280
You can help me send it
to the Ou family.

865
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,400
Yes, Young Madam.

866
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,740
(Marquis Jingyuan's Mansion)

867
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,200
Who are you?

868
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,960
What are you doing here?

869
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm the maid of Young Madam Wang.

870
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm here to see Young Madam Ou.

871
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,040
Young Madam asked me

872
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,440
to bring a letter to Young Madam Ou.

873
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,600
Our Young Madam is not home.

874
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,240
Then please give this letter

875
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
to her.

876
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,600
What?

877
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,920
She wasn't home again?

878
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,840
I've been there several times.

879
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
Not once was Young Madam Ou home.

880
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,640
And we've never heard from her.

881
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,600
Young Madam,

882
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,440
do you think

883
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,760
she is avoiding us

884
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,680
on purpose?

885
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,800
Nonsense.

886
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
She's my only friend.

887
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,120
She wouldn't do that to me.

888
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,440
But we have no way to meet her.

889
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,680
What should we do?

890
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,240
I can only

891
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,520
let that woman

892
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,640
be in charge for now.

893
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,060
(Residence of Luo)

894
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,760
Madam,

895
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,760
this is the money

896
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,880
you saved

897
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,880
for a long time.

898
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,160
Are you sure
you want to give it all away?

899
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
At least

900
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,240
I still have my monthly allowance.

901
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,560
And I'm in good health.

902
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,080
But my daughter Erniang is in

903
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,360
a difficult situation right now.

904
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,280
Bring the money to the Wang family.

905
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,200
Remember

906
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,680
to give it to Erniang

907
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,160
in person.

908
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,480
Tell her to take a good rest.

909
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,560
As long as she's well,

910
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,640
everything will

911
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
get better.

912
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,560
Remember

913
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,320
to leave from the back door
in the garden.

914
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,240
Don't let anybody see you.

915
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,920
Yes, Madam.

916
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Rest assured.

917
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,200
Nanny Xu.

918
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,720
What's in your hand?

919
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,560
Take her.
