our family has made great
contributions to this country

it's inappropriate for a great lady

to make her talent known to the people.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,040
However, you insisted on your
participation in Xianling Pavilion

too?

I haven't seen him for days.

103
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,840
He said he is going to
Leshan for study.

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,760
He has already left?

105

Zhun,

106
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
you were locked up in the abandoned room

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
that day.

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,920
Would you still want to play with Yu?

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,760
It was not his fault.

110
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,080
I have myself to blame for getting lost.

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,240
You're such a good boy.

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
You were right about one thing.

113

Yu is going to

114
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,880
Leshan for study.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,880
Your father asked him
to review his lessons

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,560
in his room.

117
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,880
You don't want to disrupt him.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,920
Okay.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,600
Nanny Tao,

120
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
take him away.

121
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Yes.

122
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
-Zhun.
-Jie, come.

123
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,960
Play the rabbit lantern with him.

124
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
Great!

125
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,360
-Come.
-Let's go.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,440
It's not easy for our family

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,480
to come to where it is now.

128
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,760
As a concubine,

129
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,320
Qiao Lianfang failed
to fight her demons.

130
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
There was nothing she would not do

131
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
for her own private gains.

132
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,120
And Concubine Wen,

133
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,040
she colluded with the Ou family

134
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,560
and worked against us.

135
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
Today, I want you to bear in mind

136
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,720
that in this family,
the wrong kind of people

137
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,160
will come to a bad end

138
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,760
and will not be tolerated.

139
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,800
Our family

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,800
will always stick together.

141
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,160
Only in this way

142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,200
can we

143
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,480
survive and prosper.

144
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,680
Yes, Mother.

145
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,960
Great Madam, it's cold outside.

146
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,360
Please have this mantle on.

147
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,480
The death of the late Marquis
and Ling'an

148
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,680
is a great loss to our family.

149
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,080
I've always wanted more children

150
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
in this family,

151
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
who will grow up into reliable men

152
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,840
to take care of our family.

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,280
However, accidents keep happening

154
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,760
to our family.

155
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
Great Madam, you worry too much.

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Getting rid of the black sheep

157
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,280
causes no loss

158
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
to the family.

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,960
Now,

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,160
His Lordship can cut the mustard

161
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
and has gained reputation for our family

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,880
among the officials.

163
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
There is nothing to worry about.

164
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,040
Lingyi does everything for the family.

165
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,240
However,

166
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,760
I still worry about him.

167
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,560
Without his approval,

168
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,360
Shiyi would have quit

169
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,680
Xianling Pavilion.

170
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,960
She is too absorbed in her own business

171
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,040
to take care of the family.

172
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,600
That's why

173
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,320
she hasn't got pregnant yet.

174
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
Late Her Ladyship

175
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,880
appointed her sister Shiyi

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,440
to replace her

177
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,640
for the sake of Zhun.

178
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,120
Once Her Ladyship gives birth to a son,

179
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,400
it would be a threat to Zhun.

180
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,160
Her Ladyship is a smart person.

181
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,880
Perhaps

182
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,720
this is one of the reasons

183
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,120
she hasn't got pregnant yet.

184
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,760
Lingyi has reassured the Luo family

185
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
that Zhun is the unopposed choice

186
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,440
to be his heir.

187
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,920
So,

188
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,560
why would she worry about this?

189
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,200
It seems

190
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,320
she has no intention of
getting pregnant at all.

191
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
All right.

192
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
It's late.

193
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,920
Get some rest.

194
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,000
This way, please.

195
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:55,900
(Mansion of Prince Yu)

196
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,760
It is just a banquet.

197
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
However,

198
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,920
dealing with dignitaries

199
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,600
is an art

200
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,560
about interpersonal relationship.

201
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Yanxing,

202
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,360
this is your first time
meeting these people.

203
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
Pay attention to etiquette.

204
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,600
And learn from your brother.

205
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,880
Yes, Father.

206
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,420
(Mansion of Prince Yu)

207
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,280
Greetings, Steward Liu.

208
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,080
Marquis Jingyuan, you're here.

209
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,880
My apologies.

210
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,720
You're guests of honor today.

211
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
Watch your step.

212
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
It is

213
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,280
a long trip.

214
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,800
His Majesty is very satisfied
with your embroidery

215
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
for his birthday celebration.

216
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,840
Today, Prince Yu will reward you

217
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
on behalf of His Majesty.

218
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,400
Yizhen, what's wrong?

219
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,160
Why the painter of the bamboo painting

220
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,680
is with

221
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,680
the Ou family?

222
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,280
What bamboo painting?

223
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
The bamboo painting

224
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,000
served up to Ling'an
at the memorial ceremony.

225
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,200
This must be your other son.

226
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,200
That's right.

227
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,240
Yanxing

228
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,680
was traveling a lot.

229
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,360
He is not familiar with etiquette.

230
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,760
Please bear with him

231
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,040
for any misconduct at the banquet.

232
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,840
No trouble at all.

233
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,760
Let's get inside.

234
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,240
This way, please.

235
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,920
Please follow me.

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,120
He is Marquis Jingyuan's son.

237
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,340
(Memorial Tablet of Xu Ling'an)

238
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,360
I cannot believe the painting
I served up to Ling'an

239
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,560
was painted by my enemy.

240
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,640
Yizhen!

241
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,520
Yizhen!

242
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,600
What is going on?

243
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,600
Marquis Yongping, Great Madam Xu,

244
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,800
this way, please.

245
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
Are you all right?

246
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,600
It's okay.

247
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Get on your knees!

248
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,800
Mother...

249
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,080
My Lord,

250
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,440
I only have one question

251
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,760
for Shiyi.

252
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,240
Why Xianling Pavilion

253
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,440
has a member of the Ou family?

254
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,800
That's my question too.

255
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,360
Knowing who he is,

256
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
why did you still

257
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,440
keep Ou Yanxing

258
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,200
at Xianling Pavilion?

259
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,320
It's not

260
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,960
what you think.

261
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
So, Lingyi,

262
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,280
you knew that, too?

263
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
You knew that Shiyi was associating

264
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,600
with the Ou family.

265
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,840
And you allowed her

266
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,600
instead of stopping her.

267
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,960
Did you forget

268
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,280
what the Ou family did

269
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,240
to our family?

270
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,440
Did you forget

271
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,240
the death of your father and brother?

272
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,720
Mother,

273
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,000
as a member of the Ou family,

274
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,680
Ou Yanxing didn't know
what happened in the past.

275
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,960
He has never been involved in the feud

276
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,320
between the two families.

277
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,160
He went by the name Lin Shixian

278
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,920
and joined Xianling Pavilion

279
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,520
by accident.

280
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,120
He has helped our family and Shiyi

281
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,360
many times.

282
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,920
That's why

283
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I allowed Shiyi

284
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,600
to associate with him.

285
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,800
Mother,

286
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,040
Yizhen,

287
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
it is Shiyi's fault

288
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,240
as much as it is mine.

289
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
My Lord,

290
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,920
he is a member of
the Ou family, after all.

291
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,480
The Ou family must be up to something,

292
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,200
allowing him to stay
in Xianling Pavilion.

293
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,520
Shiyi,

294
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
do you know

295
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,160
how Ling'an was persecuted to death?

296
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,240
And I paid tribute to him

297
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,400
using our enemy's painting.

298
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
How could his soul

299
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
find peace?

300
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
How am I supposed to face him

301
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,680
after my death?

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,760
Yizhen.

303
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,600
Yizhen.

304
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,800
The bamboo painting

305
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,200
was a mistake.

306
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Besides,

307
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,600
Ou Yanxing has quit

308
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,400
Xianling Pavilion.

309
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Yizhen,

310
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm sorry

311
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,160
for making you sad.

312
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
It was my fault.

313
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,960
My apologies.

314
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,240
Admitting your fault is a good thing.

315
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,560
All this

316
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,440
would not happen

317
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,720
if you didn't insist on

318
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,880
staying in Xianling Pavilion.

319
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,120
I want you to quit

320
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,720
Xianling Pavilion right now

321
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,840
and stay home

322
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,440
to take care of the family
and run the house.

323
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,760
Mother,

324
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,400
it's a good thing for Shiyi

325
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,760
to work at Xianling Pavilion,

326
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,720
studying and teaching embroidery.

327
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,830
Besides,

328
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,040
Shiyi never ignores
the household affairs

329
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,880
because of Xianling Pavilion.

330
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,350
Mother, why can't you just let go of it?

331
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
Lingyi,

332
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,480
no matter by laws

333
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,560
or the rules of the family,

334
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,760
she shouldn't be doing business.

335
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,000
I didn't stop her

336
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,880
for your sake.

337
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
But now,

338
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,400
this has to stop.

339
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,600
A woman should perform her duties.

340
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
Now that you've married
into the Xu family,

341
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,240
you are expected to commit yourself

342
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,080
to this family.

343
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,880
You can't get distracted.

344
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,840
All right,

345
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,240
this is final decision.

346
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Mother,

347
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,280
you were right.

348
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,320
As for the bamboo painting,

349
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
it was my fault

350
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,920
that Yizhen got her feelings hurt

351
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,960
and you got disappointed.

352
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,960
I will accept any punishment

353
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,160
from you and Yizhen.

354
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,400
But I can't

355
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,920
quit Xianling Pavilion.

356
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
Why?

357
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,000
Before becoming the wife
of Marquis Yongping,

358
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,560
I was Luo Shiyi.

359
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,640
I found comfort

360
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,880
in embroidery.

361
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
I enjoyed embroidery.

362
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,360
I wanted to reach out to girls

363
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
who also like embroidery.

364
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I don't want to

365
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,280
say goodbye to all these things

366
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,960
because of my identity
as the wife of Marquis Yongping.

367
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,800
Mother, Yizhen,

368
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,560
please do me this kindness.

369
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,360
But the Ou family

370
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,680
is keeping a close watch

371
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,320
on Xianling Pavilion.

372
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,960
While you work there,

373
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,200
you might get used by them,

374
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
putting the Xu family at risk.

375
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,320
The bamboo painting

376
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,320
was an example.

377
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,000
You don't want it to
happen again, child.

378
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,960
Quitting Xianling Pavilion

379
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,760
is your best choice.

380
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,640
Mother,

381
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
please let me stay in Xianling pavilion.

382
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,720
I will be very prudent.

383
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,240
I will never

384
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,160
put the Xu family in peril

385
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,280
because of Xianling Pavilion.

386
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,160
I...

387
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,080
Shiyi,

388
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,920
did I ever give you a hard time

389
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,920
since you married into the family?

390
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,360
What are you saying?

391
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,400
You've been a sister

392
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,880
to me.

393
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,600
I never wanted anything

394
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,080
from you.

395
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,280
Now, would it kill you

396
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,040
to make a concession

397
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,040
for the sake of the late Marquis

398
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,040
and Ling'an

399
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,480
who were persecuted to death?

400
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,720
-Yizhen!
-Second Madam!

401
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,200
-Second Madam!
-Yizhen!

402
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,520
-Bring her to her room.
-Yizhen!

403
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,120
Get back to her room.

404
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,600
Shiyi,

405
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,160
from today,

406
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
you're grounded

407
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,600
in Western Lateral Court.

408
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,040
Lingyi,

409
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,760
if anything happens

410
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,040
to Yizhen,

411
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,920
how could you face

412
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,840
our ancestors?

413
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,920
Shiyi,

414
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,480
I heard that you're grounded by Mother.

415
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,840
I'm here to see you.

416
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,640
-How are you
-Greetings, Your Ladyship.

417
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,560
practicing embroidery right now?

418
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,160
It was all because of embroidery.

419
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,320
Danyang.

420
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,840
Shiliu, have a seat.

421
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,280
Men and women have
different parts to play.

422
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
Through the ages,

423
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,040
men have been expected
to make achievements

424
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,880
while women to run the house.

425
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,080
That's the rules.

426
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,200
And you will suffer

427
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
for breaking the rules.

428
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,560
Shiyi,

429
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,560
why can't you just

430
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,720
assist your husband

431
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,400
and bring up children

432
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
like all the other women do?

433
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,960
Is that the only role

434
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,920
for our women?

435
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,400
Is it a fault

436
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,360
to do what we please

437
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,560
while performing our duties?

438
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,720
Your Ladyship,

439
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,640
ever since you married into this family,

440
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,920
you've been impeccable

441
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
in taking care of

442
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,680
Great Madam,

443
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
Zhun,

444
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,960
as well as household affairs.

445
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
You're very skillful at embroidery.

446
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,680
Your talent doesn't deserve

447
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,800
to go unremarked.

448
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,440
However, the Xu family
imposes strict rules.

449
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,400
Given what has happened,

450
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,000
Great Madam

451
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,360
cannot simply compromise.

452
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,840
Even if His Lordship

453
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,440
wants to stick up for you,

454
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,800
there is a limit to how much he can do.

455
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,520
What can we do to fix this?

456
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,960
Your Ladyship, Young Madam Qian

457
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,960
and Young Madam Wang

458
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,760
are here.

459
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,800
I see.

460
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,400
Shiyi,

461
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,760
your sisters are here.

462
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
You shall talk with each other.

463
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,000
Concubine Qin and I should go.

464
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,720
What brings you here together?

465
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,080
Aren't you a calm person?

466
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,840
How could you not feel bad

467
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
about being grounded?

468
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,760
Nanny Tao told us about your plight

469
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,080
in a letter.

470
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,120
That's why we're here.

471
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,720
I heard that

472
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,000
you got grounded by Great Madam

473
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,480
because of your business

474
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,640
in Xianling Pavilion.

475
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,640
Of course I had to come here.

476
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,000
We got anxious

477
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,240
at the news.

478
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,680
We came here immediately,

479
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,920
worrying if you are suffering.

480
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,880
How come?

481
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,680
Stubborn as she is,

482
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
just be glad

483
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,720
she doesn't make others suffer.

484
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,040
Sorry for making you worried.

485
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
I should be punished

486
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
for what I did.

487
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,120
I deserve it.

488
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,480
Ever since we were kids,

489
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,040
you've been more assertive than us.

490
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,280
However, things are different now.

491
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,320
From now on,

492
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,280
you don't get to

493
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,360
act on your caprice.

494
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,080
It seems you're having a hard time

495
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,640
being the wife of Marquis Yongping.

496
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,800
You were quite good

497
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,240
when you scolded me.

498
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,240
Why do you become

499
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,040
this pushover

500
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,920
in the Xu family?

501
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,640
It turns out

502
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,960
you're a coward at heart.

503
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,360
Now I get it.

504
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
You're here

505
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,680
to laugh at me.

506
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,200
What goes up must come down.

507
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
Did you see it coming

508
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,680
when you were lecturing me?

509
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,120
All right, all right.

510
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,480
It's good to know

511
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,840
that you're fine.

512
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,920
In a hurry to see you,

513
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,040
we haven't visited Great Madam Xu yet.

514
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,760
That is inappropriate.

515
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,640
We should

516
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,480
be paying respects to Great Madam Xu.

517
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,360
Sure, you go.

518
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,720
Erniang, let's go.

519
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,320
Erniang,

520
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,640
I don't expect you to do the talking.

521
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,200
I'll do it.

522
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,160
If you talk to Great Madam Xu like that

523
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,160
and get Shiyi caught

524
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,520
in the crossfire,

525
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,520
I won't let you get away with it.

526
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,840
Wuniang, you sound serious.

527
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,320
Let me see

528
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,400
what you're going to do with me.

529
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,640
I...

530
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,240
You're not going to be

531
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
my baby's aunt.

532
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,040
You're so childish.

533
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,560
You got to listen to me!

534
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,120
Your visits are too few.

535
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,040
As sisters,

536
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,360
you should spend more time together.

537
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,040
That would be nice.

538
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,120
Great Madam Xu, you're right.

539
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,320
We haven't seen Shiyi

540
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,880
for a long time.

541
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,640
We learned today

542
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,040
that you have taught her a lesson

543
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,320
because of her misconduct.

544
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,880
Then...

545
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,120
In fact, Shiyi has known her mistake.

546
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,880
Shiyi used to be

547
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,440
a willful girl.

548
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,520
However,

549
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,520
after marrying

550
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,120
into the Xu family,

551
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,640
she has become prudent

552
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,680
and organized.

553
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,680
You have taught her well.

554
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Young Madam Wang,

555
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,200
you're giving me far more
credit than I deserve.

556
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,560
Not at all.

557
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,880
Shiyi was trusted by

558
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,400
Great Madam Xu and Marquis

559
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,680
to manage the household affairs.

560
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,800
She has taken good care

561
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,400
of the family,

562
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
caring for the elderly

563
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,320
and the kids,

564
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,240
and putting the shoes on the right foot.

565
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,520
And Marquis

566
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,760
loves her very much.

567
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,640
Everything seems perfect.

568
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Great Madam Xu,

569
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,960
you did a great job instructing her.

570
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,600
As her sisters,

571
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,040
we're happy for her.

572
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,240
I know about

573
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,760
all her good deeds.

574
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,840
However,

575
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,280
she will not be tolerated

576
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,120
for getting out of the line.

577
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,320
Shiyi is your daughter-in-law.

578
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,200
You only want what's best for her.

579
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,800
However, Shiyi is still young.

580
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,840
Please bear with her

581
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,520
for her mistakes.

582
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,680
The Luo family

583
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,240
and I, as her sister,

584
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,000
will remind her

585
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,600
to be careful about her words and deeds

586
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,160
and to stay on your good side,

587
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,000
for the sake of the relationship
of our families.

588
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,520
Young Madam Wang,

589
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,280
I see your point.

590
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,800
You may rest assured

591
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,960
that our two families

592
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,600
will stay on good terms

593
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
because

594
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,480
Shiyi knows to fix it when it's wrong.

595
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,040
Great Madam Xu,
thank you for your mercy.

596
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Erniang,

597
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,760
that was bold,

598
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,600
saying all those things.

599
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,840
Aren't you afraid of
getting Great Madam Xu mad?

600
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,960
Our words don't count for much.

601
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,320
However,

602
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,240
if we keep silent,

603
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,320
Shiyi will be even more

604
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,560
looked down upon.

605
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,600
Don't worry.

606
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,040
It sounds that

607
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,680
Great Madam Xu will let go of it

608
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,680
if Shiyi admits her fault.

609
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,960
It seems I was wrong.

610
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,320
Erniang,

611
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,480
you do care for

612
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,600
Shiyi.

613
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,920
Come on.

614
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,200
I hate to admit it,

615
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,840
but she is my sister.

616
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,720
I would be embarrassed

617
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,000
if she got looked down upon.

618
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,000
My Lord,

619
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,240
Here you are.

620
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,640
Don't worry.

621
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,000
I know Mother well.

622
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,480
She is disgruntled now.

623
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,760
The more rebellious you are,

624
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,160
the more insistent she will be,

625
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,360
making the whole thing a deadlock.

626
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,440
We might as well stay put.

627
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,600
I'll talk to her

628
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,800
when things quiet down.

629
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,760
I believe

630
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,120
there might be some flexibility.

631
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,400
This is...

632
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,440
I promised Master Jian

633
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,880
that I will finish it for her.

634
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Then, you'll finish it.

635
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,000
I always find

636
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,280
there is something special about Shiyi.

637
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
I just don't like

638
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,280
the way she is.

639
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,640
I thought

640
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,280
because of her humble origins,

641
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,080
being the daughter of a concubine.

642
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,320
But today,

643
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,040
I finally got it.

644
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,000
You got what?

645
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
I hated her

646
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,080
because she did what I wanted

647
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,640
but was afraid to do.

648
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,320
Ever since I was a child,

649
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,840
I've been told what to do and
what not to do for being a girl.

650
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,640
I never thought about

651
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,960
what I really want.

652
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,280
However, Shiyi always

653
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
follows her heart.

654
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,240
I admire her for that.

655
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,120
Come on,

656
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,400
you aren't thinking about

657
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,000
opening an embroidery shop, are you?

658
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,400
We've had enough in the family.

659
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,360
Just give it a rest.

660
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,000
What were you thinking?

661
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Even if I want,

662
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,920
I am not capable.

663
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,040
Oh, that's good.

664
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,160
I thought

665
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,520
Shiyi set a bad example for you.

666
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,720
A bad example?

667
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
So, you think what Shiyi did is wrong?

668
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,760
No.

669
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
I didn't mean that.

670
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,400
Well, I...

671
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,920
Unlike Lingyi,

672
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,680
I just can't bear to see my wife

673
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,320
work in public, exposed to sun and wind.

674
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,840
Shame on you!

675
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,720
Second Madam,

676
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,720
don't worry too much.

677
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,240
If Master Ling'an knew the truth,

678
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,280
he would understand.

679
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,440
Who would have known

680
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,600
Her Ladyship was in contact
with someone from the Ou family?

681
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,440
It was an accident.

682
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,440
What is in the past is in the past.

683
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
We should not mention it again.

684
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,200
Yizhen.

685
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,600
Mother.

686
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Great Madam.

687
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,720
Yizhen,

688
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,600
I'm here to see you.

689
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,800
Are you feeling any better now?

690
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,960
Mother,

691
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,560
I'm sorry

692
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
for making you worried.

693
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,920
I feel much better now.

694
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,360
We can dispense with the courtesy.

695
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,840
Have a seat.

696
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,960
Sit.

697
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,520
Shiyi's two sisters

698
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,320
came to me

699
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,520
today.

700
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,600
I never thought
Young Madam Wang and Shiyi

701
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,920
were in a good place.

702
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,560
However, she has been

703
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,880
speaking up for Shiyi.

704
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,560
I was

705
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,230
surprised.

706
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,150
It seems her heart was touched

707
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,230
by Shiyi's sincerity.

708
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,710
They show solidarity.

709
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,190
This is a good thing

710
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,440
for Shiyi

711
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,880
and our family.

712
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,600
Shiyi impressed others

713
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,230
with her personal virtue.

714
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,120
That's what the matron
of Xu family should be like.

715
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,920
However, the bamboo painting thing

716
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,630
really let me down.

717
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,150
Otherwise,

718
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,920
I would never treat her like that.

719
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,120
In fact,

720
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,840
Shiyi has a good heart.

721
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,560
It's just

722
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,880
she hasn't

723
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,240
figured it out yet.

724
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,000
After all,

725
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,320
she didn't experience

726
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,600
what happened to our family.

727
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,720
It's hard for her
to understand our feelings.

728
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,680
I believe she will come around one day.

729
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,720
Great Madam,

730
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,360
in my opinion,

731
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,680
there was an oversight

732
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
only because Her Ladyship
has been too busy

733
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,520
with work in Xianling Pavilion.

734
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,200
She can take care of Xianling Pavilion,

735
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,520
but she fails to

736
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,960
take care of this family?

737
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,560
She goes to Xianling Pavilion

738
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,920
every now and then.

739
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,720
That is inappropriate!

740
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,080
In her heart,

741
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,200
she never sees herself

742
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,720
as the matron of Xu family.

743
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,520
Great Madam, please calm down.

744
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,160
I didn't mean that.

745
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,760
I was trying to say

746
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,680
that Her Ladyship is smart.

747
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,480
There was negligence

748
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,480
and some untrue rumors

749
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,000
about Her Ladyship,

750
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,800
it was never Her Ladyship's intention.

751
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,840
Great Madam,

752
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
you must trust Her Ladyship.

753
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,040
Sit. Sit.

754
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,960
Sit!

755
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,920
Yes.

756
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,560
She is too smart

757
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
for her own good.

758
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,720
How could she associate
with the Ou family?

759
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,760
If I don't

760
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,720
discipline her,

761
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,400
who knows how far

762
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,000
she could get?

763
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,000
Mother...

764
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,080
All right.

765
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,440
You don't need to speak up for her.

766
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,680
I know clearly

767
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,880
what kind of woman we want

768
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
for managing the household affairs.

769
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,760
I will teach her

770
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,200
about the doctrine of being a wife.

771
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
Otherwise,

772
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,280
I can't trust her

773
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,480
with the future of
Lingyi and the Xu family.

774
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,620
(Xianling Pavilion)

775
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,800
Who would have thought

776
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,240
the madam who commissioned the painting

777
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,960
was the Second Madam of the Xu family?

778
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,480
Shiyi must have suffered a lot

779
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,240
in the Xu family.

780
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,080
It was the last day

781
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,000
I would go to Xianling Pavilion.

782
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,120
When she commissioned that painting,

783
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,120
I thought it would be a good way

784
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,760
to end my days here.

785
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,560
However, it caused trouble for Shiyi.

786
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,280
Don't say that.

787
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,720
This isn't your fault.

788
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,200
Don't blame yourself.

789
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Madam.

790
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,960
You're here.

791
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,840
Look, these flowers

792
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,880
are fresh from my garden.

793
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,600
How do you like it?

794
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,320
Madam,

795
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,600
you grow the prettiest flowers.

796
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,280
Later,

797
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,640
ask two servants

798
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,760
to send two flowerpots to Her Ladyship.

799
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,760
Also, I got this embroidered
handkerchief

800
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,240
that I want Her Ladyship to see.

801
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,320
You know,

802
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,000
being idle at home,

803
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,360
I would like to learn embroidery

804
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,560
from Her Ladyship.

805
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,640
I got mud on my hands.

806
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,440
Amber,

807
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,840
I need you to get
the handkerchief for me.

808
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,520
It's right on top of the cupboard.

809
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,280
Yes.

810
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,720
Amber,

811
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,080
not this one.

812
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,880
What's wrong?

813
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,720
Why...Why do you have this
embroidered handkerchief?

814
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,280
What is your relationship

815
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,480
to Concubine Tong?

816
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,920
Who did you say?

817
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Concubine Tong.

818
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,480
Which Concubine Tong?

819
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,360
This half of embroidered handkerchief

820
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,720
belongs to Concubine Tong.

821
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,400
Concubine Tong, Tong Biyu,

822
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
was the maid of late Her Ladyship

823
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,040
Both of us were maids back then.

824
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,360
And we were close.

825
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,640
She'd gave me this before she died.

826
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,000
You got the other half.

827
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,240
So,

828
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,160
you're Biyu's sister?

829
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,840
Madam,

830
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,880
it's not that I don't trust you.

831
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
However, this is about my sister.

832
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,000
How am I supposed to believe

833
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,640
that this half of handkerchief

834
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,520
belongs to Concubine Tong?

835
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,240
Before her death,

836
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,320
Biyu's biggest wish

837
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,680
was to find her younger sister.

838
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,280
Now I meet you.

839
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,400
I want you to make yourself known

840
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,720
to your elder sister.

841
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,080
Come.

842
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,480
This is where Biyu lived

843
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,960
when she was alive.

844
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,920
She made these embroideries

845
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,360
on her own.

846
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,760
Amber,

847
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,920
you might want to verify the stitches.

848
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,640
This is my sister's handkerchief!

849
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,520
This is my sister's handkerchief!

850
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,280
It turns out my sister

851
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,960
lived right here!

852
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,400
However, she...

853
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,760
Biyu was thinking of you

854
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,520
when she died.

855
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,440
However,

856
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,240
she could never see you again.

857
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,600
How did she

858
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,520
die?

859
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Well...

860
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
Madam,

861
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,920
tell me, please.

862
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,880
I've been looking for her
for a long time.

863
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,240
I must know the truth.

864
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,960
Get up first.

865
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Amber,

866
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,160
do you know

867
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,680
why they keep her room
the same after her death

868
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,600
despite the fact

869
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,000
that she was a concubine?

870
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,720
It was in this place

871
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,840
that Biyu hanged herself.

872
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,200
No one would live in this room

873
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,880
because it is deemed as bad luck.

874
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,520
That can't be true!

875
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,320
Why would my sister

876
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,800
hang herself?

877
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,240
She was

878
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,440
a very strong person.

879
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,760
Besides,

880
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,640
we started out as maids.

881
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,120
We suffered all kinds of hardships.

882
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,640
There is no way

883
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,840
she would kill herself
for little miseries.

884
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,360
You mean...

885
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,040
I have doubts about her death.

886
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,440
There must be something

887
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,240
to it.

888
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,760
Hearing what you just said,

889
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,520
I remember Biyu was very unhappy

890
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,120
during her last days.

891
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,160
Though we were close friends,

892
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,000
she still

893
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,280
had her own secrets.

894
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
It seems to have something to do

895
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,960
with late Her Ladyship.

896
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,480
But late Her Ladyship

897
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,000
was already dead.

898
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,680
We have no way of knowing it.

899
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,400
Nanny Tao, who late Her Ladyship
trusted most,

900
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,960
is still alive.

901
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,600
She must know something.

902
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,040
You're right.

903
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,560
If you want to know

904
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,880
what happened at the time,

905
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,560
you might as well beg Her Ladyship,

906
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,360
letting her to ask Nanny Tao.

907
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Late Her Ladyship
is Her Ladyship's elder sister.

908
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,880
If it involves late Her Ladyship,

909
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,040
it will put Her Ladyship

910
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,360
on the spot.

911
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,080
Besides,

912
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,160
Great Madam is giving Her Ladyship

913
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,760
a hard time.

914
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,560
I shouldn't cause Her Ladyship

915
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
any more trouble.

916
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,960
Well,

917
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,840
what should we do?

918
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,960
Madam,

919
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,600
you are the only person
who can help me now.

920
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,520
Please think of a way

921
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,720
to help me find the truth.

922
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,440
I will always be grateful

923
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,160
for your great kindness.

924
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,600
Why are you on your knees again?

925
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,040
-Just get up.
-I'll remain on my knees

926
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,280
until you say yes.

927
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,440
Come on, get up.

928
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
All right.

929
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,000
Biyu was my friend.

930
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,200
If there really is something
behind her death,

931
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,480
I think I have the responsibility
to look into it.

932
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,960
Madam, thank you so much.

933
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,880
Just get up.
