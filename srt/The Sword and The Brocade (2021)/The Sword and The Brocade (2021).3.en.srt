Qiao Lianfang, the nerve of you!

Madam Xu, you misunderstood us.

Yuanniang.

31
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,540
It's not what you think.

32
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,140
I caught you two here alone

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,780
with disheveled clothes.

34
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,140
And you said I misunderstood you?

35
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,420
Madam Xu,

36
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,380
I just came here

37
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,020
to dry my outfit by the fire

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,140
because a maid

39
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,940
stained it.

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,220
Please believe me.

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,260
I can ask that maid

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,460
to prove my words.

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,180
Yuanniang.

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,780
Get out.

45
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,460
Get out now.

46
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,020
Yes.

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,380
My Lord.

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,940
I really had no idea

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,260
you would come here.

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,380
Really!

51
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,460
Xu Lingyi,

52
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,460
you cheated on me.

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,460
(Jing'an Pavilion)

54
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,380
Please wait, Madam.

55
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,540
You must be my relative.

56
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,700
I don't deserve to be called "wife".

57
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,980
You may call me "Madam Wen".

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,020
Is Her Ladyship in the room?

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,020
Yes, Madam Wen.

60
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,660
I came here with Yuanniang.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,460
Yuanniang got tired.

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,860
So she retired to her room.

63
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,820
I entered the room to see her.

64
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,940
But she said she wanted
a cup of hot tea.

65
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,140
As an outsider, I'd better not

66
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,700
wander about in the manor.

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,860
I hope you'll order the servants for me.

68
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,100
Alright.

69
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,820
I'll order the servants to make tea.

70
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,060
Let me see Her Ladyship in the room.

71
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
It's enough to have me here.

72
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,620
You shouldn't be troubled.

73
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,700
Alright. I'll go make tea.

74
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,020
I can't believe

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,020
you lost all sense of
propriety and shame

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,140
and did such a disgusting deed

77
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,340
under my nose

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,180
as a high-born lady.

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,340
I didn't do it on purpose.

80
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,300
Madam Xu.

81
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,180
My Lord.

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
I really didn't do it on purpose.

83
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,620
Please believe me.

84
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,340
Do you know the consequence
of your action?

85
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,300
Hot tea is here.

86
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,660
Let me take it to Yuanniang.

87
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,740
Yuanniang said that I should

88
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,820
take over the tea.

89
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,220
You shouldn't be troubled.

90
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,100
Let me do it.

91
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,900
I've served Yuanniang

92
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,100
for many years, after all.

93
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,100
But I'm her younger sister

94
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,220
and I rarely get a chance

95
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,460
to bond with her.

96
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,980
Please give me this chance today.

97
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,580
Lady Shiyi,

98
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,620
I'm afraid you don't know

99
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,380
much about Yuanniang's
habits and preferences.

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,140
I should stay close to inform you.

101
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,860
After all,

102
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,580
you haven't seen each other in years.

103
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,260
You are right.

104
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,340
Yuanniang and I haven't seen
each other in years.

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,660
But before she got married,

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,540
she lived in our family's house

107
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,380
as the legitimate daughter
of our Luo family.

108
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,700
We never dared to defy her

109
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,500
as her younger sisters.

110
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,100
Perhaps the Xu Family
has different rules

111
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,460
than the Luo Family.

112
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,180
If that's true,

113
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,540
then you can go ahead.

114
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,420
Look at me.

115
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,340
My concern is unnecessary.

116
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,340
I got so busy that I
became muddle-headed.

117
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,580
I would never mistrust you.

She is lucky that she'll get to

173
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,140
I'm willing to marry the Marquis,

174
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,260
even though

175
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,020
I can only be his concubine.

176
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,460
Lianfang,

177
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,220
have you lost your mind?

178
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,900
Lianfang,

179
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,100
this is not a trifle.

180
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,900
You can't make a stupid decision

181
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,420
and ruin your life.

182
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,740
Did you hear that?

183
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,860
Did you hear that?

184
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,740
Aunt,

185
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,740
I know you think in my best interests.

186
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,020
But I've made up my mind.

187
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,660
I'm willing to serve

188
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,740
the Marquis for the rest of my life.

189
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,980
I'm willing to become his concubine.

190
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,260
Since you

191
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,620
love Lingyi so much

192
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,100
and will serve him

193
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,580
until death,

194
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
I'll forget about what you did.

195
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,420
It's all settled.

196
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,940
Every time Dianchun Hall hosts operas,

197
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,140
I rest in Jing'an Pavilion

198
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,740
for peace.

199
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,180
You know that.

200
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,260
What do you mean?

201
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
I thought

202
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,940
we'd at least respect each other

203
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,420
as husband and wife,

204
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
if not help

205
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,060
each other.

206
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,860
But now all you do

207
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,820
is speculating and scheming.

208
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,420
You mean

209
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,260
I was scheming

210
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,020
against you and Qiao Lianfang?

211
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,300
Don't abuse my affection for you.

212
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,380
Affection?

213
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,500
You only treat me

214
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,220
with distance.

215
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,540
When did you ever show me affection?

216
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,540
Did I force Qiao Lianfang

217
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,580
to enter the courtyard?

218
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,540
Instead of condemning

219
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,380
that shameless bitch,

220
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,180
you even question

221
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
your humiliated wife.

222
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,140
Which one of us is being abusive?

223
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,060
Even if I schemed

224
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,260
and put on an act

225
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,740
earlier today,

226
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,900
can you swear

227
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,940
Qiao Lianfang has
never thought about it?

228
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,900
Can you swear your mother

229
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,540
has never wanted her here?

230
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,220
After my illness aggravated,

231
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
Qiao Lianfang and her mother

232
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,420
have been coming here

233
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,740
more and more frequently.

234
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,700
But I've never wanted her.

235
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,140
If you'd trusted me a little more,

236
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,340
we could have avoided

237
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,020
what happened earlier today.

238
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Do you think I want it

239
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,780
to happen?

240
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,860
Do you think I want

241
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,580
to find you a concubine

242
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,900
before my death?

243
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,340
Madams, come with me

244
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,820
to the drawing room for some rest.

245
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,140
You must be tired after
watching the opera.

246
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,980
Go with Danyang to the drawing room
for some rest.

247
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,420
The banquet will start soon.

248
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,740
Madam Luo.

249
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,900
Her Ladyship is
feeling a little unwell.

250
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,300
Go check on her please.

251
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,260
Great Madam.

252
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,180
I need to check on Yuanniang.

253
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,500
Go now.

254
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,740
Lady Shiyi.

255
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,980
Great Madam.

256
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,420
Was the opera good today?

257
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,540
It was a classic opera

258
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,260
performed by the famous actors
of Huayin Troupe.

259
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,900
Of course it was good.

260
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,700
What about the other opera?

261
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,340
Did it satisfy you?

262
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,020
I'm curious

263
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,020
as to what kind of role

264
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,420
you play

265
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,420
in the other opera.

266
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,220
You jest.

267
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,140
I'm of humble status and my words
don't carry weight.

268
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,020
I'm only an outsider.

269
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,940
Besides, there are things
that we should do

270
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,220
and there are things that
we should not do.

271
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,500
What I did earlier today

272
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,940
was inappropriate,

273
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,260
but I'm confident to say

274
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,540
that I have no axe to grind.

275
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,820
You're quite eloquent.

276
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,140
I hope you are right.

277
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,780
What did the Great Madam say to you?

278
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,860
She just asked me

279
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,420
whether the opera was good.

280
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,780
Then what happened

281
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,580
after Yuanniang called you away?

282
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,380
If you are curious,

283
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,860
you should ask Yuanniang.

284
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,740
Was it fun?

285
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,860
What's the matter?

286
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,540
Are you ill?

287
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,980
Come on, Zhun.

288
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,300
Can we play outside?

289
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,700
Mother.

290
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,580
Put this dress away.

291
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Don't let devious people find it.

292
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,660
They'd think they could

293
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,220
rest easy from now on.

294
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,340
Yuanniang,

295
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,540
you've made

296
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,020
such a dangerous move.

297
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,820
You know better than I do

298
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,740
that we must not let anyone

299
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
violate our space.

300
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,820
I had to crack

301
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,140
the toughest nut

302
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,380
to prevent trouble.

303
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,540
If she joined the Xu Family

304
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,620
as a concubine,

305
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,220
the Qiao Family

306
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,260
would feel indignant.

307
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,860
All high-born ladies cherish
their reputations.

308
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,260
The Qiao Family would be disgraced

309
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,620
if such a scandal broke.

310
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,020
How did the Marquis

311
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,500
react to this?

312
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,140
He is filial to his mother.

313
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,300
The Great Madam has taken a stand.

314
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,060
He can only take her in
as his concubine.

315
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,100
He has agreed to propose a
marriage between Zhun

316
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,140
and a lady of the Jiang Family
for their consideration.

317
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,980
What about the matter
of his second wife?

318
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,940
Only Shiyi can be his second wife.

319
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,100
It happened that she stayed
in the drawing room.

320
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,580
It happened that I succeeded.

321
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,380
It happened that she was clever enough

322
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:04,940
to stop Concubine Wen,

323
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,940
who almost sabotaged my plan.

324
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,740
I wanted Erniang

325
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,260
to marry into the Xu Family.

326
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,820
But Erniang can't keep her composure.

327
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,620
Even if she married into the Xu Family,

328
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,900
she'd be no match for Qiao Lianfang.

329
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,060
I'm just worried

330
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,260
that Shiyi is too intelligent

331
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,500
and won't be controlled

332
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,380
easily.

333
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,820
Don't worry.

334
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,700
Qiao Lianfang

335
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,700
is the apple of the Great Madam's eye.

336
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,820
She also has the Qiao Family's support.

337
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,180
She won't behave herself

338
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,100
after I pass away.

339
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,740
Shiyi is just a concubine's daughter.

340
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,500
She'll have to rely on the Luo Family

341
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,780
to prevail over Qiao Lianfang.

342
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,060
Did my mother say anything?

343
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,580
I don't know.

344
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,660
It must be your wife's

345
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,860
scheme.

346
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,100
Poor Lianfang.

347
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,940
She is the daughter

348
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,980
of a duke's wife.

349
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,420
She just came here

350
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,140
to watch an opera,

351
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,620
and next thing you know,
she is going to become a concubine.

352
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,620
Mother.

353
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,380
I

354
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,900
disapprove.

355
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,380
I don't love her.

356
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,100
I have no wish to ruin her chance
at a happy marriage.

357
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,500
I'm afraid Yuanniang won't tolerate her

358
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,100
if she doesn't join our family.

359
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,220
Son,

360
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,940
a woman's reputation is more
important than her life.

361
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,380
Can you bring yourself

362
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
to see her reputation ruined?

363
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,820
She...

364
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,100
she'll never

365
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,860
find a good husband that way.

366
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,500
I won't be a good husband

367
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,580
to her.

368
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,100
I already have several concubines

369
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,300
and they're examples of failed marriage.

370
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,100
I can't show her the respect
she deserves

371
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,100
and I can't give her a harmonious
and happy marriage.

372
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,420
I shouldn't ruin the rest of her life.

373
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,900
Kid,

374
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,900
you don't understand women.

375
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,260
Lianfang loves you

376
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,380
so much.

377
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,860
We can't let her down.

378
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,780
I don't care what the truth is.

379
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,180
You've ruined her reputation

380
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,900
after all.

381
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,660
Our family

382
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,580
is a righteous one.

383
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,100
We must offer a satisfactory solution.

384
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,900
Yes.

385
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,180
I didn't think this through.

386
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,180
It's my fault.

387
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,860
I know what's on your mind.

388
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,060
What's done is done.

389
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,380
There is no right or wrong anymore.

390
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,500
We have to accept the reality

391
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,980
for peace of mind.

392
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,740
Just marry her

393
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,540
for my sake.

394
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,540
(Mansion of Luo)

395
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Shiyi.

396
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,100
-Mother.
-Madam.

397
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,500
Shiyi.

398
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,020
I just visited Concubine Duan

399
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,460
and gathered an important information

400
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,780
from her.

401
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,460
She told me

402
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,220
Her Ladyship intended
to tie her family

403
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,660
and the Wang Family together
through marriage.

404
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,500
Is the information reliable?

405
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,060
Concubine Duan and I

406
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,220
used to be pretty close.

407
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,940
I think the information is reliable.

408
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,820
Wang Yu

409
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,460
is Duke Mao's only son.

410
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,900
So this is one of the prizes

411
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,580
Erniang was referring to.

412
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,100
Wang Yu.

413
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,180
Is Wang Yu

414
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,420
the playboy

415
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,140
who caused trouble at Xianling Pavilion

416
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,460
according to you?

417
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,500
Uh...

418
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,940
I knew

419
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,740
Concubine didn't summon us back

420
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,660
for anything good.

421
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,340
Ordinary families would rather

422
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,500
sell their daughters

423
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,380
than marry them off

424
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,380
to Wang Yu the playboy.

425
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,100
Forget about the Wang Family.

426
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,620
The incident that took place

427
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,740
at today's spring banquet

428
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,780
was not unimportant.

429
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,860
Yuanniang must have set this trap

430
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,100
for her own reason.

431
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,820
I think the Xu Family and the
Qiao Family

432
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,300
have kept the incident from being known.

433
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,140
It seems Lady Qiao

434
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,700
is going to marry the Marquis as
his concubine.

435
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,420
Did Yuanniang

436
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,300
set such a big trap

437
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,860
only to find

438
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,500
a concubine

439
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,340
for her husband?

440
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,180
Her illness might be incurable.

441
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,900
She wants one of her younger sisters

442
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,620
to marry her husband after her demise,

443
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,740
so as to protect the interests of
Zhun and the Luo Family.

444
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,260
That's the other prize Erniang
was referring to.

445
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
But what does that have to do

446
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,180
with the Marquis taking in a concubine?

447
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,980
One more concubine

448
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,740
means one more competitor.

449
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,060
I think

450
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,260
Yuanniang has no choice.

451
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,060
I'm afraid

452
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,700
Great Madam wants Lady Qiao

453
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,860
to marry the Marquis after
Yuanniang's demise.

454
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,180
Therefore she is the biggest threat

455
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,460
to Yuanniang's plan.

456
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,500
Yuanniang set a trap to make
Lady Qiao a concubine.

457
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,780
This way,

458
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,780
Yuanniang can use

459
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,580
the high-born concubine Lady Qiao

460
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,980
to contain her younger sister,

461
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,420
who will be the Marquis' second wife.

462
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,700
Yuanniang

463
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,260
is no less calculating

464
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,820
than Her Ladyship.

465
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,580
Mother.

466
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,060
There's one more thing that worries me.

467
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
What is it?

468
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,980
Yuanniang picked me

469
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,620
at Dianchun Hall today.

470
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,140
She dragged me into her plan.

471
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,940
I witnessed the whole incident.

472
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,940
I'm afraid

473
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,420
Yuanniang chose me

474
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,740
to be the Marquis' second wife.

475
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,860
Son,

476
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,500
you must be careful.

477
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,540
Devious people

478
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,180
may make comments in front of
His Majesty.

479
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,580
It's not worth the candle

480
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,260
to arouse His Majesty's suspicion.

481
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,500
That's why I objected to
betrothing Zhun

482
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,780
to the Jiang Family.

483
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,180
I'm worried

484
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,940
that Zhun is too young

485
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,020
and he hasn't grown a personality.

486
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,340
Betrothing him right now

487
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,580
might lead to a disharmonious
marriage in the future.

488
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,380
You're right.

489
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,940
But Yuanniang

490
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,820
is very competitive.

491
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Now that she's at the end of her life,

492
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,980
she won't have peace

493
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,180
unless arrangements have been made

494
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,780
as she wishes.

495
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,180
Very well.

496
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,420
She is my wife after all.

497
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,660
Our family owes the Luo Family
a debt of gratitude.

498
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,100
It's reasonable and justifiable

499
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,260
that I grant her wish.

500
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,420
The Jiang Family includes two brothers.

501
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,380
Jiang Bai works at the Imperial Academy

502
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,780
as the Scholar Director.

503
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,540
Jiang Song went back to Le'an

504
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,420
and opened a private school

505
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,740
called Jinxi.

506
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,540
I hope to betroth Zhun

507
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,780
to Jiang Song's eldest daughter.

508
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,740
Jiang Song holds no office or
title of nobility

509
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,900
while Jiang Bai is the Scholar Director.

510
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Son,

511
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,140
you can analyze things

512
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,260
deeply and thoroughly.

513
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,700
Betrothing a member of the
Xu Family to Jiang Song's daughter

514
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,220
is more reassuring

515
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,740
than to Jiang Bai's daughter.

516
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,020
If you marry into the Xu Family,

517
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,260
you'll be the dignified

518
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,180
wife of the Marquis.

519
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,540
Besides, Marquis Yongping

520
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,460
brought the Xu Family
back to prosperity.

521
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,580
It proves he is not Wang Yu's kind.

522
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,220
Daughter,

523
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,300
I really think

524
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,100
he'll be a good husband for you.

525
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,380
Marquis Yongping already
has two concubines.

526
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,700
I met them today.

527
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,340
They didn't look easy-going.

528
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,060
Now

529
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,300
the high-born daughter of a duke's wife

530
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,900
will become the Marquis' concubine,

531
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
foreboding conflict

532
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,700
even before her marriage.

533
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,900
Mother,

534
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,340
we've seen plenty

535
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,340
of schemes and struggles

536
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,820
in noble families.

537
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,820
There are many things

538
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,100
worth doing in this world.

539
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,820
I don't want to spend my life like this.

540
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,460
But most of the men in this world

541
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,340
have several partners.

542
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,100
Besides,

543
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,820
you'll have to get married
sooner or later.

544
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,020
I'd rather stay single

545
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,380
and keep you company until death

546
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,060
if marriage means serving a man
with other women

547
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,100
and never-ending conflict.

548
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,340
Silly girl, you're saying silly
things again.

549
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,980
Women need marriage

550
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,980
to become established.

551
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,060
But Master Jian isn't married.

552
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,780
Come on, kid.

553
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,020
Mother, if I have too much fear,

554
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,580
I'll end up being controlled

555
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,820
like other women.

556
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,860
I'll spend the rest of my life

557
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,580
living off another person.

558
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,180
But you

559
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,220
don't get

560
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,500
to decide your fate.

561
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,420
When Her Ladyship
has made the decision,

562
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,100
nobody can change it.

563
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,660
I need to try my best.

564
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,100
My Lord,

565
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,900
why are we intervening

566
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,660
with the boat theft case

567
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,820
and not going after Liu Yong?

568
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,740
There are many checkpoints on land.

569
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,740
Liu Yong is a pirate.

570
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,940
If you were him,

571
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,180
what would you do?

572
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,060
You mean

573
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,060
Liu Yong probably stole the boat?

574
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,660
What if we can't

575
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,020
find any clues?

576
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,660
Then you won't

577
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
get your pay this month.

578
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,300
Why?

579
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,580
Because you talk too much.

580
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,140
I...

581
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,060
I'm sorry.

582
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,100
(Meritorious Deeds Live Forever
Yuyi Oil Mill)

583
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,820
My Lady,

584
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,980
don't leave me.

585
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,140
I'm going with you.

586
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,340
Dongqing,

587
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,820
I won't leave you.

588
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,220
I just said I'd visit my teacher

589
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,500
to get Her Ladyship's permission

590
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,900
for me to leave the house.

591
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,780
I must cherish

592
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,140
this opportunity.

593
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,460
Take this embroidery work

594
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
to my teacher's place for sale.

595
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,540
Be careful.

596
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,860
But the wharf is a chaotic place.

597
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,220
Why can't I go to the wharf

598
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,900
or you go to Xianling Pavilion
for Master Jian?

599
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,900
Am I the Lady here

600
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,060
or are you the Lady here?

601
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,060
Don't get carried away.

602
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,940
Got to go. Listen to me.

603
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,020
Take care.

604
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,940
Be careful.

605
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,980
Don't worry.

606
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I'm not that delicate.

607
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,820
You can be careless.

608
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,980
Don't lose the embroidery work
on the way.

609
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,540
Where can I rent a boat?

610
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,340
I don't know.

611
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,180
Where can I rent a boat?

612
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,220
-Over there.
-There it is.

613
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,100
Thank you.

614
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,780
Have you recently seen

615
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,380
a sturdy man

616
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,660
with a southern accent?

617
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,940
No, I have not.

618
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,100
Oh, no.

619
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,740
I'm sorry.

620
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
How can you be so careless?

621
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,580
I'll compensate you.

622
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,900
Take it.

623
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,700
Wait.

624
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,140
You flipped my booth

625
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,540
and damaged my rouge.

626
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,180
And you pay me so little
in compensation?

627
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,220
How much do you want?

628
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,900
At least five tael of silver.

629
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,860
Five tael?

630
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,300
Yes.

631
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,300
I've paid enough

632
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,220
for your rouge.

633
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,220
You're scamming me.

634
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,060
I'm not scamming you.

635
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,900
Don't leave.

636
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,660
Let go.

637
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,420
What are you doing?

638
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,460
Who are you?

639
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,540
No.

640
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,980
It was her.

641
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,860
She flipped my booth.

642
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,580
-Look.
-Stop.

643
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,580
You can't pay me so little.

644
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,140
Don't you know

645
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,260
how much your rouge is worth?

646
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,340
You might as well stop doing business.

647
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,500
No.

648
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,740
Fine.

649
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,900
This must be my unlucky day.

650
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,780
I won't bother with you.

651
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,660
Greetings, My Lord.

652
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,620
It's you.

653
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,020
My Lord,

654
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,260
isn't she the girl

655
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,620
held hostage by the pirates?

656
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,620
She is also...

657
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,900
She is my wife's younger sister.

658
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,220
You are a member of the Luo Family.

659
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,020
I'm Luo Shiyi.

660
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,940
Why did the Luo Family

661
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,700
let you come to this chaotic place?

662
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,060
My servants

663
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,380
are waiting for me there.

664
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,340
Would they leave you

665
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,100
here alone?

666
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,060
Tell me the truth.

667
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,340
I have my reason for coming here.

668
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,060
I hope you'll pretend that you
didn't see me here.

669
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,100
Lin Bo.

670
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,860
Send Lady Luo home.

671
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,820
No need.

672
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,740
No need to trouble you.

673
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,940
I can walk on my own.

674
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,820
Since you met me here,

675
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,220
I must take responsibility for you.

676
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,980
If something bad happens to you,

677
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,380
I won't know what to tell your
elder sister.

678
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,740
Thank you for your concern.

679
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,580
But if you

680
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,260
really cherished my elder sister,

681
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,540
you wouldn't have... that day...

682
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,460
I won't bother you anymore.

683
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,300
That young woman is remarkable.

684
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,780
She really is your wife's younger
sister.

685
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,260
My Lord.

686
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
What did she mean

687
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,340
by "that day"?

688
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,900
Lin Bo,

689
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,100
Censor Liu has a daughter

690
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,740
who is 18 years old, cultured

691
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,740
and beautiful.

692
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,660
No.

693
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,980
My Lord, you remembered it incorrectly.

694
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,300
Censor Liu's daughter

695
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,180
is extremely ugly and bad-tempered.

696
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,220
That's why she is still unmarried

697
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
at age 24.

698
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,860
You care about

699
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,340
my family affairs so much.

700
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,860
You must be wanting a family
of your own.

701
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,820
No.

702
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,100
No, no, My Lord.

703
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,860
My Lord, I'm sorry.

704
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,580
I'm sorry.

705
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,900
Start searching now.

706
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,500
Search.

707
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,100
Yes.

708
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,500
(The Wharf)

709
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,540
Lady Luo.

710
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,780
Good tea.

711
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,180
Do you have knowledge of tea?

712
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,380
My guess is

713
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,220
this is the Longjing tea harvested
before the solar term Guyu.

714
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,340
It's too early to harvest tea
in the solar term Qingming.

715
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,540
It's too late to harvest tea
in the solar term Lixia.

716
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,900
It's the right time to harvest tea

717
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,500
around the solar term Guyu.

718
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,220
You are right.

719
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,500
This is the Longjing tea
harvested before Guyu.

720
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,060
I didn't expect you to have

721
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,060
knowledge of tea.

722
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,380
I just lived in Yuhang for years

723
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,340
and happened to be familiar

724
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,620
with the Longjing tea.

725
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,460
You lived in Yuhang?

726
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,500
Why are you here

727
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
all alone?

728
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,180
All sorts of people mix at the wharf.

729
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,540
You'd better not associate with him.

730
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,100
I plan to return to Yuhang.

731
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,780
I'm going to rent a boat.

732
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,140
I'll travel southward next month

733
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,500
and pass by Yuhang.

734
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,180
If you don't mind,

735
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,140
you can take my boat.

736
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,100
We can take care of each other that way.

737
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,420
That's wonderful.

738
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,220
How much is the fare?

739
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,580
You're a straightforward person.

740
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,060
If I don't charge you,

741
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,700
you probably won't feel at ease.

742
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,740
How about this?

743
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,340
Since I'll send you to Yuhang

744
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,940
on my way,

745
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,140
you can pay me half the market price.

746
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,860
Thank you then.

747
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,620
Are you going to Yuhang
to visit your family?

748
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,180
You must have traveled

749
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,900
to a lot of places.

750
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,420
Do you enjoy

751
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,980
the sights?

752
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,500
It feels the best

753
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,380
when I drink in the natural landscapes

754
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,620
with a jug of wine in my hand.

755
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,780
I have traveled around

756
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,820
over the years as a merchant.

757
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,340
After I viewed the beautiful landscapes,

758
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,020
I realized how humble humans were.

759
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,060
Humans were like ants and grass.

760
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,460
I became bored of worldly troubles.

761
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,660
You live such a free life.

762
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,180
It makes me yearn for the same thing.

763
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,460
What a shame

764
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,860
that women rarely see

765
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,260
the beautiful landscapes of this world.

766
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,860
Don't feel bad.

767
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,660
The last time I saw you,

768
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,060
I noticed how much your mother

769
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,980
cared about you.

770
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,220
It's lucky

771
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,460
to have a mother like that.

772
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,900
My birth mother died early.

773
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,100
I'm unpopular at home.

774
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,780
I have to take hints all the time.

775
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,900
Where else can I go

776
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,540
except for mountains and waters?

777
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,860
I don't think

778
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,460
you should put yourself down.

779
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,820
We can't choose our families,

780
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,780
but we can decide

781
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,420
our fates.

782
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,220
Look.

783
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
It's good

784
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,380
to live the way you do.

785
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,940
You're really unique.

786
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,260
You're admirable

787
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,180
for making efforts to improve your life

788
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,380
despite your family background.

789
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,820
It's getting late.

790
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,820
I should go.

791
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,740
Our boat will set sail on the first day
of the next month.

792
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,020
The wharf is not a safe place.

793
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,460
Where should we meet up?

794
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,020
Can we meet up at Ci'an Temple?

795
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,580
I'm more familiar with that place.

796
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,300
Alright.

797
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,060
Then see you at 7 a.m. on the first day
of the next month.

798
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,620
Antai.

799
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,260
Young Master.

800
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,700
Lady Luo.

801
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,980
This is Antai.

802
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,420
I'll take him with me

803
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,060
and pick you up on the first day
of the next month.

804
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,700
Then we'll leave by boat.

805
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,100
Thank you.

806
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:46,140
(Military Commission)

807
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,700
My Lord.

808
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,820
It seems the boat thief

809
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,060
is unrelated to Liu Yong.

810
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,300
What do we do now?

811
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,340
We must carry out a more
thorough search.

812
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,340
It's getting late.

813
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,460
You may go.

814
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,020
Go. Go.

815
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,140
Yes.

816
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,540
My Lord.

817
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,500
I thought you were going home.

818
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,820
I still have some official duties to do.

819
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,300
My Lord,

820
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,100
your wife must have prepared dinner

821
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,420
at this hour.

822
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,340
She must be waiting for you.

823
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,220
How about we

824
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,380
go home and rest early?

825
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,740
You can do your official
duties tomorrow.

826
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,660
If you are hungry,

827
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,580
you can go home now.

828
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,340
I'm not hungry.

829
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,060
How can I be hungry
when you are not hungry?

830
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,460
I stand with you, My Lord.

831
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,500
I often see you skip meals
and sleep for your official duties.

832
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,620
But I don't see the court reward you.

833
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,860
(Zhilan Court)
Your Ladyship.

834
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,500
The Jiang Family sent a letter.

835
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,780
What is it about?

836
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,100
They said Lady Erniang was
demure, elegant

837
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,260
and kind to her sisters.

838
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,540
Young Madam Jiang likes her very much.

839
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,660
It must be fate's work.

840
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,660
In that case,

841
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,860
I have to marry Erniang

842
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,420
into Duke Mao's Mansion.

843
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,140
But

844
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,340
the son of Duke Mao is infamous.

845
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,700
He is not a good man.

846
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,700
You've always adored
Lady Erniang the most.

847
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,780
It's kind of a shame

848
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,700
to marry Lady Erniang off to him.

849
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,300
We've nurtured her all these years to
make use of her.

850
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,780
As a member of the Luo Family,

851
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,780
she needs to share our burdens

852
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,820
and help secure Zhun's future.

853
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,820
Besides,

854
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,940
she is just a concubine's daughter.

855
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,780
She is lucky enough

856
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,500
to marry the son of Duke Mao.

857
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,300
If she is smart,

858
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,540
she'll feel grateful.

859
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,940
(I enjoyed all the flowers of...)

860
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,540
I have bad news.

861
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,580
Stop writing.

862
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,500
Something awful just happened.

863
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,180
What happened? Don't panic.

864
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,340
The Jiang Family sent
a letter last night,

865
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,220
saying...

866
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,220
saying Young Madam Jiang chose you.

867
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,220
I can't believe

868
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,820
Her Ladyship agreed

869
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,780
to marry you to Wang Yu.

870
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,940
Mother, you must have misheard.

871
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,460
Wang Yu is such an undesirable man.

872
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,220
Why would Her Ladyship

873
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,380
marry me to him?

874
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,180
But it's true.

875
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,740
Her Ladyship's maid

876
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,980
said so.

877
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,300
I've been bribing her

878
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,140
with plenty of money and jewelry

879
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,580
for a long time.

880
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,060
She doesn't tell me lies.

881
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,020
No way.

882
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,420
I don't believe this.

883
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,420
Her Ladyship has always doted on me.

884
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,660
Why would she

885
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,980
marry me to Wang Yu?

886
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,180
Her Ladyship loathes Shiyi so much

887
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,780
that she drove her to Yuhang.

888
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,580
If she has to marry a girl to him,

889
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,140
that girl should be Shiyi,

890
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,500
not me.

891
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,300
Silly girl,

892
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,940
she does loathe Shiyi.

893
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,820
But think about it.

894
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,780
You are no different

895
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,060
than Shiyi.

896
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,820
You all are nothing but

897
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,820
humble daughters of the concubines

898
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,020
and pawns used to benefit the Luo Family

899
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,780
in her eyes.

900
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,100
Lady Shiyi.

901
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,180
Great Madam.

902
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,740
Wang Yu is ruthless

903
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,660
and promiscuous.

904
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,820
He has gained notoriety in the capital.

905
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,020
He even beat several maids

906
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,580
who served him in the bedroom to death.

907
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,860
If you marry him,

908
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,260
then...

909
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,540
Duke Mao's Mansion

910
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,700
Wang Yu.

911
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,100
I can't believe it's me.

912
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,700
Wang Yu is too immoral

913
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,100
for any noble family

914
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,540
to form ties through marriage.

915
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,060
They simply want to marry you

916
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,780
in exchange for a marriage

917
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,020
between Zhun and a lady

918
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,540
of the Jiang Family.

919
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,340
(Riding on my steed lightheartedly
in the vernal breeze,)

920
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,020
(I enjoyed all the flowers
of Chang'an in a day)

921
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,500
Why me?

922
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,420
Why sacrifice me

923
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
for their benefits?

924
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,380
Shiyi must be behind this.

925
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,420
She has been up to no good
since she returned.

926
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,220
She must have schemed

927
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,860
to steal my marriage.

928
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,220
In that case,

929
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,020
don't blame me

930
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,020
for discarding our sisterhood.

931
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,260
(Tianxiang House)
Sir, come in and have a few drinks.

932
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,780
Come in, sir.

933
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,660
My Lady,

934
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,060
is Wang really in there?

935
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,500
We've been here for a long time.

936
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,740
Why is he still not out?

937
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,900
He must be in there.

938
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,140
I had people follow him.

939
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,260
So I'm sure.

940
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,380
My Lady, will this work?

941
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,300
What if...

942
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,900
Shut up.

943
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,660
We must succeed.

944
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,540
He is out, My Lady.

945
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,620
That's Wang Yu.

946
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,820
Goodbye, sir.

947
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,100
Remember to come again.

948
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
Wait here for me.

949
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,340
Be careful.

950
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,420
Don't leave, sir.

951
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,300
Be careful, Young Master.

952
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,900
Go back.

953
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,700
Remember to come again.

954
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,500
(Tianxiang House)

955
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,220
Young Master.

956
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Are you blind?

957
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,540
Watch where you're going.

958
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,420
You just bumped into me.

959
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,020
I think...

960
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,860
What are you talking about?

961
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,740
I am Wang Yu.

962
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,900
Does it hurt?

963
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,140
How about this? Does it hurt?

964
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,740
You should be fine.

965
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,020
You just had a mild sprain.

966
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,940
I'll write some prescriptions.

967
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,460
Go home and rub the medicine
on your body.

968
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,220
You'll heal in a few days.

969
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,780
Wait.

970
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,540
My carelessness

971
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,900
has injured you,

972
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,900
pretty girl.

973
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,620
I feel so sorry.

974
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,700
Don't blame yourself.

975
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,100
I got the injury

976
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,460
because I inadvertently glanced at you.

977
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,740
Your great appearance

978
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,620
and impressive bearing

979
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,980
sent me into a trance.

980
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,700
It was my fault,

981
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,260
not yours.

982
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,340
Fate must have brought us together.

983
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,180
What is your name?

984
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,260
Where do you live?

985
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,860
How about you come home with me?

986
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,220
I am Luo Shiyi.

987
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,580
I live in Nanchi Lane.

988
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,860
The Luo Family's manor sits
in Nanchi Lane.

989
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,980
Are you a relative of Marquis Yongping?

990
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,380
Yes.

991
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,420
Do you know my family?

992
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:13,860
I heard

993
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,660
that Lady Erniang of the Luo Family

994
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,340
is just as lovely as you.

995
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,180
Is it true?

996
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,540
You mean my second sister?

997
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,620
She is great in every way.

998
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,380
We can't reach her level.

999
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,460
But...

1000
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,780
But what?

1001
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,380
But

1002
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,380
despite Erniang's

1003
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,660
exceptional beauty and talent,

1004
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,900
she suffers an ill fate.

1005
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,300
She is

1006
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,700
very frail.

1007
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,820
Even the slightest sign of disturbance

1008
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,100
can make her bed-ridden for days.

1009
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,860
Therefore,

1010
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,660
other sisters and I

1011
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,460
dare not disturb her.

1012
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,180
We can only wish her

1013
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,940
better health.

1014
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,300
She is sick?

1015
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,340
Then I won't be able

1016
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,660
to use my skills on her.

1017
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,100
That won't do.

(The Book of Changes)

1019
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,580
That definitely won't do.
