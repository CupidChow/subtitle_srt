=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 10=

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,280
What else do you have to say?

5
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,120
Mr. Gu.

6
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,040
This money
really has nothing to do with me.

7
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,680
Foreigners

8
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,280
transferred it from Huaqi Bank

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
to your personal account.

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,480
Your accountant

11
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,519
turned you in.

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,319
They said you sold firearms.

13
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,879
What else do you have to say?

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,959
Mr. Gu.

15
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,400
I was wrongly accused.

16
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,190
Even if you give me
tens times the courage,

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,280
I wouldn't dare betray you.

18
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,760
Mr. Chen.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,450
Could you help me put in a good word?

20
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,519
Mr. Gu.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,079
If I really made such a fortune,

22
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,120
I would have just left.

23
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,000
Why would I
stay in Hu City and wait for death?

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,159
Think about it.

25
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,200
I've

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,439
worked for the Gu family for years.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,350
I've worked hard
even if I didn't achieve much.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,319
I will take good care of your family.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,879
You're heartless.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,180
Why aren't you offering to die
to atone for your sins this time?

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
The gun was empty last time.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,240
This time,

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,840
there are bullets in the gun.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,319
You're a pro.

35
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,520
You're indeed Chief Fu's protégé

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,280
and an excellent detective.

37
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,039
Stop making sarcastic remarks.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
Gu Huaizhou.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,280
If I hadn't told you
that Chief Fu had discovered

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,439
the Gu family's smuggling

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,319
and destroyed all evidence

42
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,960
after the Fu family was wiped out,

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,759
the Gu family would have been doomed.

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,919
I've done

45
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,360
a lot of dirty work for you
over the years.

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
You're ungrateful!

47
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,080
Zhao Zhong.

48
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,080
Here's an advice.

49
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,719
Think twice,

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,120
even if it's for your family.

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,080
Stop lying to me.

52
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,400
Even if I'm dead,

53
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,400
you won't spare them.

54
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,240
Qianyu.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,360
Gu Huaizhou.

56
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,439
Prepare a car for me.

57
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,680
Or I'll kill her now.

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Let her go.

59
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,680
I'll let you live.

60
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,280
Do you think I'm a fool?

61
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,719
If I let her go,

62
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,080
do I have a chance to live?

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,080
Prepare a car for me.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,199
Or I'll shoot.

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,280
Do you think you can threaten me?

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
I'll give you a chance.

67
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,840
Put the gun down.

68
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,520
I'll let your family live.

69
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,919
Shoot if you dare.

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,919
I'll kill your wife first.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
You can't threaten him with me.

72
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,439
I'm not that important to him.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,240
He won't spare you because of me.

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,839
Are you okay, Qianyu?

75
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,680
I'm fine.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,560
Mr. Chen.

77
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,580
Send Mrs. Gu back to her room.

78
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,399
Yes.

79
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,439
Mrs. Gu.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,690
This way, please.

81
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,399
What happened?

82
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,680
Zhao Zhong was caught
for embezzling company funds.

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,040
He tried to kill me
but was killed instead.

84
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,319
I guess it's karma.

85
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,439
Ding.

86
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,319
Drag the corpse to the police station.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,290
The chief police will handle it.

88
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,040
Yes.

89
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,890
Carry the corpse away.

90
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,600
A lot of things have happened

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
since you came home.

92
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,120
It's my fault.

93
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,240
It's fortunate
that you came back in time today.

94
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,399
Here.

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
Few days ago,

96
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,480
the French ambassador

97
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,040
gave me a bottle of fine wine.

98
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,720
I brought it back for you to try.

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,639
But I didn't expect

100
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,439
this to happen when I came home.

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,720
What a bummer.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,800
Thank you.

103
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,800
It just so happens
that Qianyu was frightened today.

104
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,780
She probably
won't be able to sleep well at night.

105
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,759
I'll have a few drinks with her

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,759
to calm her down.

107
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,160
You really care about Qianyu.

108
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:31,879
Fine.

109
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,079
I've delivered the wine,

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
so I'm going to go.

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,439
Okay.

112
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,380
(Li Sitang)

113
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,180
(Gu Jingzhou, Gu Huaizhou, Zhao Zhong)

114
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,100
(Zhao Zhong)

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,500
(Memorial Tablet of Gu Zhaoren)

116
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,000
Father.

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,879
Zhao Zhong is dead now.

118
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,399
I will kill

119
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,439
everyone involved
in the Fu family's murder

120
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
and settle the scores for you.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,319
Zhao Zhong betrayed the Fu family
for ill-gotten money.

122
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,279
And now he's dead
because of money from an unknown source.

123
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,240
Karma is a boomerang.

124
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
How satisfying.

125
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,319
Do you also think that the money

126
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,839
came from an unknown source?

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,680
Isn't it?

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,079
Gu Jingzhou did it.

129
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,839
He sold a batch of firearms
and asked the buyer to wire the money

130
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,079
to Zhao Zhong's account.

131
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,000
He also bribed the firm's accountant
to inform Gu Huaizhou.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,839
What is Gu Jingzhou up to?

133
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,040
Do you remember what I told you before

134
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,590
about him arresting
several of our comrades?

135
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,680
Yes.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,290
I was just about to rescue them,

137
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,160
but he already released them secretly.

138
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,079
That's not all.

139
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,190
He also gave them
travel passes and travel expenses.

140
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,730
Besides that,

141
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,990
the shiploads of opium he had robbed
didn't enter the market.

142
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,799
They were secretly destroyed.

143
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
Strange.

144
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,440
Didn't he make a fuss at the wedding

145
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,919
just to get
the Gu family's shipping business?

146
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,559
Didn't he

147
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,320
do for money?

148
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,440
That's the part
I can't figure out either.

149
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,200
Is he trying

150
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,519
to ruin it?

151
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,279
But what's in it for him to ruin
the Gu family's smuggling business?

152
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,120
Is he trying to bring down General Zheng

153
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,000
and seize his power?

154
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,679
Then he didn't have to

155
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,679
destroy all the opium.

156
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,320
By the way,

157
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,160
there's something else
I forgot to tell you.

158
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,679
The person who took my nude photos
before the wedding

159
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,559
was Li Sitang.

160
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,559
In other words, Gu Jingzhou saved you?

161
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,759
Not really.

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,240
He has his plan.

163
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,990
He's probably just going with the flow.

164
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,039
What are you going to do next?

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
I had planned to secretly release

166
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,559
(Gu Jingzhou, Gu Huaizhou )
the news of Gu Jingzhou's

167
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,180
hijacking of the smuggling ships
to General Zheng and Gu Huaizhou

168
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and watch them fight each other.

169
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,799
Since Gu Jingzhou's stand is unclear,

170
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,080
let's put him aside for now.

171
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Gu Huaizhou
is cunning and overly suspicious.

172
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
He won't let his guard down easily.

173
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,879
Don't be too adventurous.

174
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,679
I know

175
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,639
Gu Huaizhou doesn't trust me.

176
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,120
When I came out today,

177
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,200
someone from Gu Manor followed me.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,350
What are you going to do about it?

179
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,970
I'll take advantage of the situation

180
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,360
and gain his trust completely.

181
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,519
You're not really
going to be his real wife, are you?

182
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,639
If I can gain his full trust,

183
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,039
why not?

184
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,790
Have you really thought it through?

185
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,460
(Memorial Tablet of Gu Zhaoren)

186
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,039
From the moment
I decided to get revenge,

187
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,200
I was ready to risk everything.

188
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,399
My body

189
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,159
is nothing.

190
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,960
I went to Lu's Clinic
to get treatment today.

191
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,440
This person
has been following me furtively.

192
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,279
He received a beating after I caught him.

193
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,679
He said Mr. Chen sent him to follow me.

194
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,759
Mr. Chen.

195
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,919
What do you have to say about this?

196
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,279
Mrs. Gu.

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,279
You misunderstood.

198
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,840
It hasn't been safe out there lately.

199
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,600
It's too dangerous
for you to go out alone.

200
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,039
That's why I sent him

201
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,740
to follow you.

202
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,230
I think protection is just an excuse.

203
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
You're spying on me.

204
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,240
Even though
I come from a humble background,

205
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,159
I'm still the mistress of Gu Manor.

206
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,200
Do you think I'm a pushover?

207
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,360
Mrs. Gu.

208
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,440
You really misunderstood.

209
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,879
Huaizhou.

210
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,960
Shouldn't you say something?

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,559
Enough.

212
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,039
Mr. Chen meant well.

213
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,559
Let's

214
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
just let it go.

215
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,879
Let it go?

216
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,639
I suffered such an injustice.

217
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,559
Instead of defending me,

218
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,840
you want me to let it go.

219
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,720
Alright.

220
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,960
You treat me like an outsider.

221
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,879
I'll leave then.

222
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,399
Mrs. Gu.

223
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,440
Mr. Gu.

224
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,159
Mrs. Gu...

225
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,679
Mr. Chen did go a little too far,

226
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
but he's just worried about your safety.

227
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,840
If he was really worried
about my safety,

228
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,990
he could have
sent bodyguards to protect me,

229
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,480
instead of sending someone
to follow me secretly.

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,879
He was clearly spying on me.

231
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,720
Besides,

232
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,360
he wouldn't have done it

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,960
if you didn't allow him.

234
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,399
Huaizhou.

235
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,080
Aren't you suspecting me?

236
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,879
You're my wife.

237
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,279
How could I suspect you?

238
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,399
Have you really considered me your wife?

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,240
Yes.

240
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,720
I know I don't deserve
to marry into the Gu family.

241
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,039
I also know I don't deserve to be yours,

242
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,399
but I didn't want
to put you on the spot.

243
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,720
I tolerated everything,

244
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,279
including that night.

245
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,000
You got drunk and hugged me,
calling out Fu Zhaoxue's name

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,279
all night.

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,279
I...

248
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,600
I didn't even say no.

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,279
No matter how you treat me,

250
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,639
I'm devoted to you.

251
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
But now you suspect
that I'm the mole in Gu Manor.

252
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,279
What am I still doing here?

253
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,440
I should just leave.

254
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,080
Enough.

255
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,799
What's the matter?

256
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,399
Are you going to check

257
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,480
whether I'm the mole in Gu Manor?

258
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,679
Enough.

259
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,240
Stop making a fuss.

260
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,639
Am I making a fuss?

261
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,879
Yes.

262
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm lowly,

263
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,080
but I still have dignity.

264
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,279
Everyone in Gu Manor is wary of me.

265
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,159
I have no face to stay.

266
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,000
By the way,

267
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,240
you custom made

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,180
this cheongsam for me
not long after I join the family.

269
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,039
I'll give it back to you.

270
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
Enough, Qianyu.

271
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,639
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
It's my fault.

273
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:30,720
I...

274
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,240
I wronged you.

275
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,919
How could you do this to me?

276
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,240
You're the only person

277
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,399
I can depend on

278
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,879
in this world.

279
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,399
I told you.

280
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,759
You will always
be the mistress of the Gu family.

281
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,919
Huaizhou.

282
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,840
Don't worry.

283
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,399
I will protect you.

284
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,559
You're mine.

285
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,120
Jingzhou?

286
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,000
Why are you back?

287
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,500
Why didn't you inform me in advance?

288
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,360
I'm here to tell you something.

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,600
My Commander's Department
is in disrepair.

290
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,360
When I woke up this morning,

291
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,100
the water leakage
has formed a waterfall.

292
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,540
That's why
I want to move back for a few days.

293
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,840
Huaizhou.

294
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,159
Is my room

295
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,200
still vacant?

296
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
You haven't lived at home
in the past few years.

297
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,519
Your room has been vacant.

298
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,190
It's no place for anyone to stay in now.

299
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,639
But the guest room is clean.

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,720
Pick one.

301
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,240
How can a guest room
be as comfortable as my room?

302
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,120
It's alright.

303
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,480
I'll just ask Ding to clean it up.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,240
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

305
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,279
Your room

306
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,279
is next to Qianyu's room.

307
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,519
It's inappropriate.

308
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,879
How is it inappropriate?

309
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
It doesn't bother me.

310
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,840
It bothers me.

311
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,840
You should avoid suspicion.

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,639
Is there anything suspicious between us?

313
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,080
Your father killed my fiancée's family.

314
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,240
Even if all the women
in the world are dead,

315
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,759
I won't be interested in you.

316
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,799
You...

317
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,759
Okay.

318
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,159
I got it.

319
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,670
Are you not letting me stay here

320
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,990
because you're afraid that I might hear
some noise in the middle of the night?

321
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,639
Jingzhou.

322
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,639
Father's mourning period isn't over.

323
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,990
Qianyu and I have been sleeping
in separate rooms since our wedding

324
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,519
to observe the mourning period.

325
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,559
Everyone in Gu Manor knows about this.

326
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,559
You shouldn't say such a thing.

327
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,680
Then why were you...

328
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,279
Since you insist
on staying in your own room,

329
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,079
you may do so.

330
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,640
Thank you, Huaizhou.

331
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,640
Huaizhou.

332
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,359
Can you accompany me tonight?

333
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,079
I can also go to your study.

334
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:45,680
Well...

335
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,470
Jingzhou's staying in the next room.

336
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm a little scared.

337
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,079
We're still in mourning,

338
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,119
so let's not give Jingzhou
something to talk about.

339
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,519
Don't worry.

340
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,390
There are many people in Gu Manor.

341
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,400
He won't be reckless.
