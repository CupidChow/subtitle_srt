1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,660
=Ms. Nirvana=

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 17=

4
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,159
Why are you looking at me like that?

5
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920
Is there

6
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,120
something on my face?

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,879
Huaizhou.

8
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,680
What's wrong?

9
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,680
Nothing.

10
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,910
Go back to your room and rest first.

11
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,840
I'll come and see you later.

12
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,640
Mr. Chen.

13
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,879
Why are you sweating?

14
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,560
Mrs. Gu.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,599
Nothing.

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,359
Maybe the weather is a little hot.

17
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,159
Have you lost your mind?

18
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,199
He'll be upstairs soon.

19
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,840
I saw

20
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,159
Mr. Chen pull out a gun.

21
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,199
They want to kill you.

22
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,400
Why would they kill me?

23
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,560
Something must be wrong
with that telegram.

24
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
If I'm not mistaken,

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,039
you've been exposed.

26
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,960
Xue.

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
You can't stay here anymore.

28
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll take you out of Hu City.

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
Leave the rest to me.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,159
I've already lost you once.

31
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,759
I can't lose you a second time.

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,800
But I'm still alive.

33
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,599
That means

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,590
Gu Huaizhou doesn't want to kill me yet,

35
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,360
so it proves that I still have a chance.

36
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,120
I'll figure it out myself.

37
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,479
Gu Jingzhou.

38
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,439
If you really want to help me,

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,759
just stay away from me.

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,439
Leave.

41
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,400
Mr. Gu.

42
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,340
Have you forgotten
what Old Master Gu said?

43
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,280
Get rid of the root of the problem.

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,800
A person who achieves great things
can't be dragged down by sentiment.

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,279
Mr. Chen.

46
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,639
Don't you think

47
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,920
this is all God's will?

48
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,439
If what General Zheng said is true...

49
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,399
I wanted to marry her but couldn't,

50
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,639
now

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
she took the initiative to marry me.

52
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,680
If she's really Fu Zhaoxue,

53
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,639
she must have married you for revenge,

54
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,759
not because she loves you

55
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,480
and wants to be with you.

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you think it matters

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,079
why she married me?

58
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,439
What matters

59
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,680
is that she's all mine now.

60
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,920
Ever since she married you,

61
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,920
Madam Li,

62
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,680
Ms. Li, and Zhao Zhong
all had accidents one after another.

63
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Now it seems

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,920
that she's the one behind this.

65
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,519
And the shipping route map

66
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,439
was probably leaked because of her.

67
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,439
Mr. Gu.

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,639
Don't be foolish.

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,839
If these people aren't worth mentioning,

70
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,319
you're probably

71
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,480
her next target.

72
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,319
Mr. Gu.

73
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,920
You can't hesitate any longer.

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,360
Mr. Chen.

75
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,560
You underestimate me.

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,279
The Fu family
didn't escape the Gu family's clutches.

77
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Now,

78
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,079
Fu Zhaoxue can't escape me either.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
She's not the Fu Zhaoxue she once was.

80
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,959
Your carelessness

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
will harm the Gu family

82
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,279
and yourself.

83
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,959
Mr. Chen.

84
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,600
Stop talking.

85
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,160
I know what I'm doing.

86
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,360
Gu Huaizhou.

87
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,890
I want you
to pay the Fu family with your life!

88
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,680
Huaizhou.

89
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,079
Mr. Gu.

90
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,079
What's the matter?

91
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,720
There's an urgent call from the firm.

92
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,000
The French company
refused to accept our goods.

93
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,490
They said the accounts don't add up.

94
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,310
Both parties
are in a stalemate at the pier.

95
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,079
Even the French ambassador
has intervened.

96
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,279
Hurry over.

97
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,920
French ambassador?

98
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,639
Huaizhou.

99
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,160
If you have something to do,

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,079
go handle it first.

101
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,319
I'll wait for you.

102
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,439
Mr. Gu.

103
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,600
Huaizhou.

104
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
Be safe on the way.

105
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,120
Okay.

106
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,590
Why did you give me a gun
when you've made preparations?

107
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,320
I gave you a gun to protect yourself,

108
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,919
not for you to kill.

109
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,440
Huaizhou.

110
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,919
Did you receive the telegram

111
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,159
my father sent you?

112
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,679
Yes.

113
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,039
Father is impatient.

114
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,759
You have to settle
what he told you immediately.

115
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,159
Otherwise, if he gets mad...

116
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:32,919
Huaizhou.

117
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,639
What did General Zheng tell you?

118
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,759
General Zheng said

119
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
he misses his daughter
very much recently.

120
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,799
He wants you to send Ms. Zheng

121
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,320
back to the front line to meet him.

122
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,240
Sure.

123
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,399
Gu Huaizhou.

124
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,200
You're talking nonsense.

125
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,320
Tell me

126
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,639
what General Zheng said then.

127
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm just joking with Huaizhou.

128
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,639
My father is busy fighting the war.

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,780
How could he have time
to send a telegram?

130
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,440
Gu Huaizhou.

131
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,039
Gu Huaizhou!

132
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,799
Did you receive

133
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,200
my father's telegram last night?

134
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Why is Fu Zhaoxue still alive?

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,279
Are you reluctant to take action?

136
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,360
Fu Zhaoxue is already dead.

137
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Nonsense.

138
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
She's not dead.

139
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,759
General Zheng made a mistake.

140
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,240
My wife is Lin Qianyu.

141
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,279
Stop fooling yourself.

142
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,540
The real Lin Qianyu

143
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,759
had been shot through the chest

144
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,440
by the person
my father sent to Ping City.

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,440
Yes.

146
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,240
Qianyu was indeed shot before.

147
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,320
The scar on her chest is still shocking,

148
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,000
but she didn't die.

149
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,279
A doctor tried his best to save her.

150
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,240
Also,

151
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,000
Ms. Zheng,

152
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,320
I advise you

153
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,679
to stop talking
about the fact that Fu Zhaoxue

154
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
is Lin Qianyu.

155
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,279
After all, you don't want Jingzhou
to treat Lin Qianyu as her substitute.

156
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,720
Okay.

157
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,799
You're reluctant to do it, aren't you?

158
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,039
I'll kill her myself.

159
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:06,960
Ms. Zheng.

160
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,200
You're staying in Gu Manor,

161
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,720
but you keep talking
about killing my wife.

162
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm only a businessman,

163
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,559
but I won't tolerate your insults.

164
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,320
Ms. Zheng.

165
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm sorry

166
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,559
I can't let you stay.

167
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,399
How dare you throw me out?

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
Gu Huaizhou.

169
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
You are blinded by your lust.

170
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,840
You'll regret it one day.

171
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,320
Mr. Gu.

172
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,000
You may offend General Zheng

173
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,639
by treating Ms. Zheng like this.

174
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,159
How are the smuggling ships I asked you

175
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,240
to look into?

176
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,550
I interrogated
the accountant at the firm overnight.

177
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,399
He confessed that Commander bribed him
with a large sum of money

178
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,720
to report Zhao Zhong

179
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,759
and tamper with the accounts

180
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,240
when delivering goods to the French.

181
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,000
I knew it.

182
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,360
Gu Jingzhou already knew
Lin Qianyu's true identity.

183
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,639
That's why he repeatedly appeared

184
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,120
and ruined things for us.

185
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Looks like

186
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,399
Gu Jingzhou

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,279
is helping her get revenge.

188
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,840
Mr. Gu.

189
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,159
In that case,

190
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,960
we can't keep Fu Zhaoxue.

191
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,279
You can't let a woman destroy the Gu family
you've worked so hard to built.

192
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,250
What are you afraid of?

193
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
They're

194
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,879
under my control.

195
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,480
Keep looking into the smuggling ships

196
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,650
and find evidence as soon as possible.

197
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,240
If there's no evidence,

198
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,559
make something up.

199
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,600
I want to give General Zheng

200
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,039
a big gift.

201
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,159
Are you planning

202
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,679
to use him to kill?

203
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,919
I want to trade Gu Jingzhou's life

204
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,879
with General Zheng for my wife's life.

205
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,420
(Lu's Clinic)

206
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,120
Get in the car.

207
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:24,639
You...

208
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,600
Gu Jingzhou.

209
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,850
You're doing it again.

210
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,700
Is there something you can't say nicely?

211
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,519
It's not Gu Huaizhou
who wants to kill you.

212
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,039
It's General Zheng.

213
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,879
How do you know?

214
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,919
I have spies around him.

215
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,790
He sent an urgent telegram
to Gu Huaizhou last night,

216
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,960
asking Gu Huaizhou to kill you.

217
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,320
But I don't know
why Gu Huaizhou refused.

218
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,519
This incident even annoyed Zheng Yuzhen,

219
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,600
so

220
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,399
General Zheng

221
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,200
sent his guards to kill you.

222
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,200
Xue.

223
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,559
You can't stay in Hu City anymore.

224
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,200
I'll ask Ding to send you away.

225
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,120
If I leave now,

226
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,879
all my efforts would have been in vain.

227
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,120
What do you think is more important,

228
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
your life or revenge?

229
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,240
Revenge is more important.

230
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,919
Xue.

231
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,440
I told you

232
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,759
I'll help you get revenge.

233
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,519
You'll help me

234
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,559
by staying away from me.

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,550
He is now being held at the front line
by the revolutionary army.

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
Huai City is short of soldiers.

237
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,559
Now is the best time to revolt.

238
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,960
If I take over Huai City, it's equivalent
to cutting off his retreat.

239
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,490
Working with the revolutionary army,

240
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,240
we can defeat him once and for all.

241
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,879
Do you think

242
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,759
I'll be helping you that way?

243
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,120
If you insist on staying here,

244
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,840
General Zheng
will use you to threaten me

245
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,330
when he withdraws from the front line.

246
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,840
Even if I'm extraordinary capable,

247
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,039
won't be able to help you.
