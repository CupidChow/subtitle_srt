00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,420
=Episode 11=

4
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,439
Five years ago, Lin Qianyu was attacked by
bandits and seriously injured

5
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,319
shortly after arriving in Ping City.

6
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,040
She was in the hospital
for several months.

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,120
Her attending physician at the time

8
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,079
was Lu Heng.

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,400
Lu Heng?

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,359
That's right.

11
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,750
After Lin Qianyu
was discharged from hospital,

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,200
she became very close to Lu Heng.

13
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,079
A year ago,

14
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,680
Lu Heng came to Hu City
and opened a clinic.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,300
He became the Gu family's private doctor
because of his excellent medical skills.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,359
Besides that,

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,280
Lin Qianyu goes to Lu's Clinic
almost every day since the ball.

18
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,560
But the Gu family said

19
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,480
she went for physiotherapy.

20
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,200
Lin Qianyu.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,239
Lu Heng.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
These two really go way back.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,439
Commander.

24
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,239
I wonder if they worked together

25
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,920
to get those six shiploads of firearms.

26
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,920
Investigate Lu Heng for me.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,480
And

28
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,719
pack my things for me.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,280
From today onward,

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm moving back to Gu Manor for a while.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,200
I'd like to see what Lin Qianyu

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,359
is up to.

33
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:04,920
Yes.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,240
Why did you come back suddenly?

35
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,479
I'm your ally.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,560
Shouldn't you consult with me

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
before you take any action?

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,879
You came just in time.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,199
I have

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,680
a little pain in my shoulder

41
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,080
from the gunshot yesterday.

42
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,199
Why don't you give me a massage?

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,000
Consider it as a way to repay me
for saving you.

44
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,840
Don't you want to know

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240
why I moved back?

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,919
Are you going to sacrifice yourself

47
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,240
to Gu Huaizhou if I don't come back?

48
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,159
The shipping route map was leaked.

49
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,960
Even though Zhao Zhong is dead,

50
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,639
Gu Huaizhou

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,159
still suspects me.

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,000
If I don't let him
let down his guard against me,

53
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,199
how can I handle matters for you?

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,319
If you put it that way,

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,960
you're sacrificing

56
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,639
for me.

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,439
I'm doing it

58
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,800
more for myself.

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm all by myself after all.

60
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,039
I need money to survive

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
in these troubled times.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
So you were rushing to degrade yourself

63
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
for money?

64
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,280
Gu Huaizhou is my husband.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,319
Even if I did something,

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,519
it's not considered degrading.

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,079
Doing it with Gu Huaizhou
isn't degrading.

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,399
Would it be considered as degrading

69
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,800
if you did something with me?

What do you want to do?

86
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,519
Didn't you say

87
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,279
that you won't be interested in me

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,790
even if all the women
in the world are dead?

89
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,079
I changed my mind.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,439
You...

91
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm afraid you'll have to wait.

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,040
My current target

93
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,680
is Gu Huaizhou.

94
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,480
Tell me.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,800
What is your purpose
in seducing Gu Huaizhou?

96
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,439
I told you.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
I just wanted him to let...

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,879
Let down his guard against me

99
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,990
so that I could get
the Gu family's fortune.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,759
What about Lu Heng?

101
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,439
What do you have to do with each other?

102
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,150
You're asking
something you already know.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,079
Lu Heng
is the Gu family's private doctor.

104
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
He treated me before.

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,519
Don't you know all that?

106
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,519
I also know

107
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,879
you two knew each other
back in Ping City.

108
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,560
He saved you.

109
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,990
After you were discharged
from the hospital,

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,040
you have been in close contact.

111
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,879
I don't understand what you're saying.

112
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,199
Let me go.

113
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,519
Are those six ships

114
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,800
a joint effort of yours?

115
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,930
What nonsense are you talking about?

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,680
Still pretending?

117
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:42,680
Fine.

118
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,780
Then let me tell you.

119
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,600
I moved back to Gu Manor

120
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,160
to figure out what you're up to.

121
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,879
Otherwise, I won't leave.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
I told you.

123
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
I just want the Gu family's fortune.

124
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,460
It doesn't matter
if you don't tell the truth.

125
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,040
I have plenty of time to play with you.

126
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,839
Since you don't trust me,

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,820
there's no need
for our alliance to continue.

128
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
Why not end it now?

129
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,680
Do you think

130
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,439
I won't be able to get
the Gu family's fortune without you?

131
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,759
Are you saying
you want to end our alliance completely?

132
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:20,839
Sure.

133
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,399
But don't forget

134
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,800
I still have your nude photos.

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,279
Do you think
you're the only one with leverage?

136
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,550
At worst, I'll tell Gu Huaizhou
about the shipping route map.

137
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,600
We'll all

138
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,480
go down together.

139
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,559
Commander.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,190
Did you find anything on him?

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,720
(Commander.)

142
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,690
(Lu Heng used to be funded by Chief Fu.)

143
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,130
(After the Fu family was killed,
he left Hu City)

144
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,990
(and went to Ping City Hospital
to work as a doctor.)

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,400
(He also took a cousin
disfigured by burns to get treatment.)

146
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,990
(After Lin Qianyu was discharged,)

147
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,799
(his cousin went missing.)

148
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,590
(Lin Qianyu changed drastically
after she was discharged.)

149
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,890
(She's like a different person.)

150
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,679
Jingzhou.

151
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,559
Come and eat.

152
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,879
Jingzhou, have some tea.

153
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:02,759
Drink it.

154
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,639
Aren't you thirsty?

155
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,360
It's too hot.

156
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,320
Thank you, Qianyu.

157
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,320
Jingzhou.

158
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
You look so pale.

159
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,600
You didn't sleep well last night?

160
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,120
Looks like
you're not used to sleeping at home.

161
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,080
Why not move back
to Commander's Department?

162
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,679
Gu Manor is my home.

163
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,759
I'm used to sleeping in my home.

164
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,080
It's just that a pervert
broke into my room last night,

165
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,780
keeping me
from sleeping well last night.

166
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,919
You're so funny.

167
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,320
Not many people in Hu City have the guts

168
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,840
to go after
Hu City's City Defense Commander.

169
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,080
I never said the pervert was a person.

170
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,600
A bee came into my room last night

171
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,000
and kept buzzing.

172
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,080
It's really

173
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,000
noisy.

174
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,720
You're really funny.

175
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,480
Why didn't you eat
the seafood mushroom porridge?

176
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,799
I don't like seafood.

177
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,639
You grew up in a fishing village

178
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
and didn't like eating seafood.

179
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,279
It's precisely
because I grew up by the sea

180
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,120
and had seafood all day

181
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,399
that I'm tired of it and dislike it.

182
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm telling you.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,120
The Gu family's ingredients

184
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,440
are the freshest in the entire Hu City.

185
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,039
It's a pity

186
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,080
that you're wasting it.

187
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,759
Finish this bowl then.

188
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,559
It won't be a waste that way.

189
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:50,840
Okay.

190
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,600
I'll drink.

191
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,879
Huaizhou.

192
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,639
You saw

193
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,480
that Jingzhou kept picking on me.

194
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,480
The thought of him staying at home

195
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,039
makes me uneasy.

196
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,679
Don't worry.

197
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,080
With me and Mr. Chen here,

198
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,590
Jingzhou won't do anything reckless.

199
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,720
Last night,

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
the thought of him staying next door

201
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,200
kept me from falling asleep last night.

202
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,320
Huaizhou.

203
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,399
Why don't you ask him

204
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,460
if he could move back
to Commander's Department?

205
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,279
Whatever it is,

206
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,679
he's the second heir of the Gu family.

207
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,850
Throwing him out will give others
something to gossip about.

208
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,120
Don't worry.

209
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,279
I'm sure he'll move back
when Commander's Department is repaired.

210
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,759
He won't stay here permanently.

211
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
Why don't we

212
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
send some of our best men to help him
repair Commander's Department?

213
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,600
This way,

214
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
it'll show our concern

215
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,679
for him.

216
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,200
This is a good idea.

217
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,679
I'll talk to Mr. Chen then.

218
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,320
By the way,

219
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,000
you've been

220
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,519
so busy with business lately

221
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,519
that you've lost weight.

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,840
I'll make you

223
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,879
some chicken soup later

224
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
and have it sent to you.

225
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
You must remember to drink it.

226
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,759
