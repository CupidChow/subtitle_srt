00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,000
Jingzhou.

5
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,550
Jingzhou, what are you doing?

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,359
Jingzhou.

7
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,079
Jingzhou.

8
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,000
You're hurting me.

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,719
Jingzhou.

10
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,120
Slow down.

11
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,680
Jingzhou.

12
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,840
What are you doing?

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,120
Jingzhou.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,799
Jingzhou.

15
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,439
That's too much.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,200
Jingzhou.

17
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,159
Jingzhou.

18
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,480
What if someone sees us?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,560
Jingzhou.

20
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,079
Lin Qianyu.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,519
You wench.

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,519
I'll expose your scandal to the public.

23
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,120
Jingzhou.

24
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,359
Jingzhou.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,719
Jingzhou.

26
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,120
Slow down.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
Do you like to do it in the clinic?

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,680
Alright.

29
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:42,760
We're done.

30
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,079
Is this how you always do it?

31
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,200
Not really.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,100
It depends on who I'm with.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,159
What about me?

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,970
Our audience has left.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,800
Audience?

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,639
What audience?

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,680
Li Sitang.

38
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,680
What a turn-off.

39
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,840
Are you using me?

40
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,000
If I don't bring her down,

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,990
how can I gain a foothold
in the Gu family?

42
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,719
You have a unique way of doing things.

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,879
Sure.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,879
I'll do something unique too.

45
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,039
Take off your clothes.

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,280
Gu Jingzhou.

47
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,639
What did you say?

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,560
Take it off.

49
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,680
Have you lost your mind?

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,840
Take it off!

Scram.

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,120
Yes.

69
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,319
Your beauty trap

70
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
only works on Gu Huaizhou.

71
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,200
If you want to cooperate with me,

72
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,759
stop playing tricks.

73
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
Remember to give me back my jacket.

74
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,120
Qianyu.

75
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,439
You're even wearing a scarf at home.

76
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,720
Isn't it hot?

77
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,040
I'm alright.

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,319
I can see that you're sweating.

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
You're not nervous, are you?

80
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,279
I didn't do anything wrong.

81
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,720
Why would I be nervous?

82
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,399
Didn't do anything wrong?

83
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,879
I don't think so.

84
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,120
Sitang.

85
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,319
Eat your meal.

86
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,639
Huaizhou.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,720
I saw her

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,560
go into Lu's Clinic
and engage in indecency

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
with Gu Jingzhou today.

90
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,560
Sitang.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,300
Don't say such things recklessly.

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,040
Isn't last time
embarrassing enough for you?

93
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,959
We have
all the evidence and witness today.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,090
I'll see how you'll deny it.

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,800
Lan.

96
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,120
Miss is right.

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,800
Mrs. Gu went to Lu's Clinic every day
these two days.

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,639
She stayed up to two hours every time.

99
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,199
She was extra careful going out and in

100
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,959
for fear that others would find her.

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,360
Huaizhou.

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,399
She wore a scarf
just to cover her hickies.

103
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,879
Do you dare to remove it?

104
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,160
Sit down.

105
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,040
Huaizhou.

106
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,519
She's obviously guilty.

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,000
You...

108
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,560
You...

109
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,279
Huaizhou.

110
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,190
Huaizhou, look.

111
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,440
Let's see how you'll explain that.

112
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:51,720
Enough!

113
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,319
Mr. Chen.

114
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,879
Lock Li Sitang in her room.

115
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,199
I...

116
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,340
Without my permission,
she's not allowed to leave it.

117
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,520
Yes.

118
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,200
Huaizhou.

119
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,990
Lin Qianyu is the one
who should be grounded.

120
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,319
You should throw
this wicked woman out of here!

121
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,639
Sitang.

122
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,120
You misunderstood me.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,839
Qianyu.

124
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,720
What happened

125
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,279
to your neck?

126
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,920
You

127
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,720
kept hugging me

128
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,720
and saying someone else's name
last night.

129
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,600
I...

130
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,920
Did we...

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,279
Nothing happened between us.

132
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,160
I know

133
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,279
we're still in mourning

134
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,839
for Father,

135
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
so

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,279
I resisted with all my strength.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,839
Sorry.

138
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,680
I injured you.

139
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,759
It doesn't matter.

140
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,260
Go to Lu's Clinic and get it checked.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,959
Don't leave scars.

142
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,120
No need.

143
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,639
I'm afraid it will be bad

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,400
for the Gu family's reputation
if it gets out.

145
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,920
It's alright.

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,839
Lu Heng
is the Gu family's private doctor.

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,120
He's a skilled doctor

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,079
who can keep secrets.

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,879
No one else will know
if you go to him.

150
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,040
Okay.

151
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,240
No way.

152
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,839
I saw them with my own eyes.

153
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,920
Dr. Lu has been giving me physiotherapy
these past two days.

154
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,839
I can't endure pain much, so...

155
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,480
Nonsense!

156
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,279
I saw you and Gu Jingzhou
entering Lu's Clinic together.

157
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,750
You even took your clothes off.

158
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,480
You even said,

159
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,159
"Jingzhou,

160
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,440
don't hurt me."

161
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,919
How disgusting.

162
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,840
Enough!

163
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,120
Huaizhou!

164
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,639
I saw them with my own eyes.

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Why won't you believe me?

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,879
Huaizhou.

167
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,080
Calm down.

168
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
Sitang was wrong

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,120
to spy on me,

170
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,120
but

171
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,559
she's your only cousin.

172
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm also a woman.

173
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,320
I understand

174
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
that Sitang did all these

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,639
because she loves you.

176
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,480
If Sitang

177
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,279
is willing to get along with me,

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,799
why not

179
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,360
give her a title?

180
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,090
Mrs. Gu,
there's something you don't know.

181
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,559
Mr. Gu promised Old Master Gu

182
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,039
that you'll be his only wife.

183
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,280
He will never take a concubine.

184
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,960
I see.

185
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,080
I can understand Sitang better now.

186
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,000
No wonder Sitang keeps setting me up.

187
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,440
Turns out

188
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,320
she wants you to hate me.

189
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,519
Sitang.

190
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,399
If you love Huaizhou that much,

191
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,120
you can just tell me.

192
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,720
I never wanted to

193
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,440
become Mrs. Gu.

194
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,399
Lin Qianyu. Stop pretending to be
a good person in front of Huaizhou.

195
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,639
You should die a miserable death

196
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,720
like your father!

197
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,200
Mr. Chen.

198
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,270
Lock Li Sitang up
in the cottage in the countryside.

199
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,440
Once Father's mourning period is over,
marry her off immediately.

200
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,210
Huaizhou.

201
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,639
I don't want to marry someone else.

202
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,110
You're the only one I want to marry!

203
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,600
Huaizhou!

204
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
Lin Qianyu.

205
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,639
You'll die a miserable death.

206
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,000
You...

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,120
Get lost!

208
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,600
No matter what,

209
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,559
you'll always

210
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,240
be Mrs. Gu.

211
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,679
Is there anyone out there?

212
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,639
Someone, come.

213
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,159
Let me out!

214
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,200
Let me out!

215
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,840
Don't lock me in here.

216
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,840
Let me out!

217
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
I already said

218
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,519
I won't eat anything.

219
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,799
Tell my cousin

220
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,080
that I rather starve

221
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,480
than marry someone else.

222
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Let me out!

223
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,559
Open the door!

224
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,960
Let me out!

225
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,799
Who are you?

226
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
Who on earth are you?

227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,759
Lin Qianyu.

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,440
Lin Qianyu, you wench.

229
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,759
If I had known this would happen,

230
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,650
I would have
made all your nude photos public.

231
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,559
Nude photos?

232
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,000
You don't know, do you?

233
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,480
Madam Li and I had someone knock you out
and take your nude photos.

234
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,080
Unfortunately,
Gu Jingzhou ruined my plan

235
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,080
I'll give you a gift.

236
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,039
Qianyu.

237
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,190
(Turns out it was Gu Jingzhou
who saved me that day.)

238
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,840
Li Sitang.

239
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,080
I was your best friend.

240
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,080
Why do you want to harm me?

241
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,720
I want to harm you.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
I want you dead.

243
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,720
You've already killed me once.

244
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
The fire was so big that day.

245
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,639
I was in so much pain.

246
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,639
Why wouldn't you save me?

247
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,559
What are you talking about?

248
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,440
Don't you know who I am yet?

249
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,279
I'm Fu Zhaoxue.

250
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,279
Your best friend.

251
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,759
I'm back.

252
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,399
Fu Zhaoxue?

253
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:14,879
Impossible.

254
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,639
She's dead.

255
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,000
She's dead.

256
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,720
Let's go.

257
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,320
Let's go.

258
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,080
Zhaoxue.

259
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,440
Miss.

260
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,559
It's none of my business.

261
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,600
On your memorial day next year,
I'll burn joss paper for you!

262
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,360
Let's go.

263
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,200
Sitang.

264
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,399
Sitang, save me!

265
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,159
Hurry.

266
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,679
I begged you to save me,

267
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,639
but you and Madam Li left me alone.

268
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,840
I thought

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,200
about going to hell

270
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,480
with my hatred for you,

271
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,080
but god was kind.

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I survived.

273
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,519
I happened to meet Lin Qianyu,
who died from a serious injury

274
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,639
and had plastic surgery
to look like her.

275
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,559
I'm back.

276
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,679
Everyone in the Fu family is dead.

277
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,480
Why aren't you dead yet?

278
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,360
Why aren't you dead yet?

279
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,360
Go to hell now!

280
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,919
Madam Li.

281
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,120
Li Sitang.

282
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,919
It's karma.

283
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
It's inevitable.

284
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,919
Are you ready for your karma?

285
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,759
What are you going to do?

286
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,679
What I'm going to do?

287
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,080
I'm your sister-in-law.

288
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,590
I'll take good care of you, of course.

289
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,840
That's why I brought Madam Li here.

290
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,720
She raised you.

291
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,360
She cares about you the most.

292
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,639
I believe

293
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,080
she'll take good care of you.

294
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,639
Lin Qianyu.

295
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,519
Come...

296
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,039
Go away!

297
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,720
Go away!

298
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,519
Don't come over.

299
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,799
Don't come over.

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,679
Don't come.

301
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,440
Don't come over!

302
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,679
