1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,660
=Ms. Nirvana=

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 6=

4
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,399
Why did you wear a riding outfit?

5
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,719
Today's ball is hosted by the Gu family.

6
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,239
I want to stand out at the ball

7
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,890
and win honor for you and the Gu family.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,319
That's why I asked the lady
who owned the clothing store.

9
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,220
She suggested
that I wear a riding outfit,

10
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,760
so I custom-made one.

11
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,400
Huaizhou.

12
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,599
Do you think it looks good?

13
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,480
Yes.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,470
All that matters is that you like it.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
I used to have a friend

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,799
who wore riding outfits to balls too.

17
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,959
But she wore white,

18
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,920
and you wore black.

19
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,760
Are you talking

20
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,159
about Ms. Fu?

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,890
It's all in the past.

22
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,680
Drink the soup while it's hot.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,760
It's getting cold.

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,039
Thank you.

25
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,599
It's getting late.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,120
Let me help you get to bed.

27
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,719
Zhaoxue?

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,879
No way.

29
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,680
Does this drug also confuse people?

30
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:54,960
Huaizhou.

31
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,000
Zhaoxue.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,000
Huaizhou.

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Zhaoxue.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Huaizhou.

35
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,479
Huaizhou.

36
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,759
You're pretty good at acting.

37
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,159
Do you often use this method
to trick Gu Huaizhou?

38
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,039
Cut the crap.

39
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,950
Do you still want
the shipping route map?

40
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,080
Here.

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Open it.

42
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,160
Are you

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,519
really disregarding

44
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,480
brotherhood for money?

45
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,439
What about you?

46
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,879
Aren't you also disregarding

47
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,600
your husband for money?

48
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,839
That's why only ruthless people like us

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
can form an alliance.

50
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,360
0219?

51
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,879
(It's the Fu family's
death anniversary.)

52
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,240
(Monster.)

53
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,100
I didn't expect Huaizhou
to love me so much.

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
He used my birthday as his password.

55
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,920
It's not in here.

56
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,930
You don't think he sleeps
with the shipping route map, do you?

57
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,200
Are you proven to be wrong?

58
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,600
Stop.

59
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,240
Don't hurt her.

60
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't hurt her.

61
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,000
Huaizhou.

62
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,600
Huaizhou.

63
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,710
I asked the kitchen
to make bird's nest soup.

64
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,959
Try it.

65
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,120
How could I deliberately embarrass you?

66
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Let's not become estranged
because of that wench,

67
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,839
Lin Qianyu, okay?

68
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,040
Huaizhou.

69
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,519
Huaizhou.

70
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Huaizhou.

71
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,439
Why are you here?

72
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Where's Huaizhou?

73
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,519
Huaizhou is already asleep.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
Huaizhou just fell asleep.

75
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,720
Give me the bird nest soup.

76
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,639
Don't disturb him.

77
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,040
Huaizhou!

78
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,839
Do you think

79
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,519
he'll help you or me

80
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,959
if you wake him up?

81
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,879
Move out of my way!

82
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,240
Lin Qianyu.

83
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,759
How dare you grab me?

84
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,560
How dare you hit me?

85
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,839
This slap

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
is for you.

87
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,879
This slap

88
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,040
was because
you framed me and Gu Jingzhou.

89
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,040
You...

90
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,240
Huaizhou.

91
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,600
Are you going to let this wench
do whatever she wants?

92
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,639
Huaizhou!

93
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,959
Move out of my way!

94
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,860
You're becoming more and more
like the mistress of the Gu family.

95
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,319
Put it back.

96
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,879
Are you just going to leave
after getting what you want?

97
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,039
What's the matter?

98
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,320
Do you want me to stay

99
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
and do something with you?

100
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,720
You're overthinking.

101
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,990
It's just that once
the shipping route map is leaked,

102
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,120
your brother will suspect me.

103
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,240
If no one helps me when that happens,

104
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,919
maybe

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll betray you.

106
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,799
Listen.

107
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,960
You don't deserve to negotiate with me.

108
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,679
Just do

109
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,320
everything I tell you to do.

110
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,799
Otherwise, I'll make you disappear.

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,799
Gu Jingzhou.

112
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
A heartless man like you

113
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,519
should go to hell.

114
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,940
(Lu's Clinic)

115
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:00,759
How is it?

116
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,390
This copy of the shipping route map
is quite detailed.

117
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,240
That's because you taught me well.

118
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,159
Gu Huaizhou didn't suspect anything,
did he?

119
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,279
Not yet.

120
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,720
However, Gu Jingzhou is eyeing
this batch of smuggled goods.

121
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,320
We have to act quickly

122
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,120
or

123
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,799
he'll get this batch of goods.

124
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay.

125
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,460
I'll arrange it right away.

126
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,279
You

127
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,600
attended the Gu family's ball
in a riding outfit yesterday.

128
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,159
The whole Hu City was shocked.

129
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,039
The rumors
about Fu Zhaoxue and the Gu brothers

130
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,120
were brought up again.

131
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,840
Doing that is too risky.

132
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,039
I can prove

133
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,440
that I'm not her

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,919
by dressing like that.

135
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,360
You're just lucky.

136
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,919
I'm attacking his weakness.

137
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,240
Gu Huaizhou

138
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,399
is extremely stubborn.

139
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,759
How can I seduce him without taking
some extraordinary measures?

140
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Since he used to like Fu Zhaoxue,

141
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,639
I'll take my chances.

142
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Turns out

143
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,039
I was right.

144
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
What about Gu Jingzhou?

145
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,639
How did he react?

146
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,279
He was agitated.

147
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,519
He warned me
not to wear a riding outfit anymore.

148
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,639
It's ridiculous.

149
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,600
He was the one who sent me to hell,

150
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,039
yet now
he's pretending to be sentimental.

151
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,879
Who is he pretending for?

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,799
You...

153
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,919
All I have for him

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,000
is hatred.

155
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,360
What?

156
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,679
Did you really see it clearly?

157
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,480
Miss.

158
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,679
I really saw her.

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,840
I followed her as you instructed.

160
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,180
As soon as she entered today,

161
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,519
Lu Heng closed the door.

162
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,480
They were in there for a long time.

163
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,039
Could Lin Qianyu

164
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,559
be hooking up with Lu Heng?

165
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,159
That slut.

166
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,990
Seducing Gu Jingzhou
isn't enough for her.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,300
She also wants to seduce Lu Heng.

168
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm so mad.

169
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,639
Well...

170
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,039
Do you think

171
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
we should tell Mr. Gu?

172
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,879
No.

173
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,200
I failed to catch her yesterday

174
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,720
and made Huaizhou angry instead.

175
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,759
Let's be careful this time.

176
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,990
Follow her for a few more days.

177
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,600
Once we have solid evidence,

178
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
she can never turn things around.

179
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,559
I'm so mad.

180
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,519
Oh.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,279
You're dressed so beautifully.

182
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,039
Where are you going?

183
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,490
Do I need to report to you

184
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
where I go?

185
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,320
You're right.

186
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,039
It was presumptuous of me to speak.

187
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,840
She's dressed like a dancer.

188
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,100
She must be meeting her lover.

189
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,559
Does she go to Lu's Clinic

190
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,279
every day these days?

191
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,200
She spends two hours there every day.

192
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,600
That's not all.

193
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,480
Yesterday,

194
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,960
I heard her making a phone call.

195
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
She was almost whispering.

196
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,200
She seemed to say she has an appointment
with someone today.

197
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,320
Is she going on a date?

198
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,720
I want to see
who she is having an affair with.

199
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,320
Let's go.

200
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,799
It's Gu Jingzhou.

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,039
Come on.

202
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,120
Shh.

203
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,600
Jingzhou.

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,180
Jingzhou, what are you doing?

205
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,360
