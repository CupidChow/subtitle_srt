00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,660
=Ms. Nirvana=

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 4=

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,599
(Mrs. Gu has just joined the family)

5
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,319
(and has already won a good reputation
among the servants.)

6
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,319
(She also threw out Madam Li.)

7
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,760
(It's evident...)

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,319
Huaizhou.

9
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,000
Madam Li

10
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,760
had her tongue cut off.

11
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,550
She had her tongue cut off?

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,959
She's

13
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,640
just an old woman
kicked out by the Gu family.

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,120
What kind of person

15
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,920
would do such a cruel thing?

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,799
Madam Li likes to spread rumors.

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,520
Perhaps

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,120
she was targeted for revenge.

19
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,240
Huaizhou.

20
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,759
She's

21
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,400
Sitang's personal servant after all.

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,319
She served the Gu family for years.

23
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,460
She worked hard
even if she didn't achieve anything.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,080
Now that she lost her tongue,

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,820
it will be hard
for her to make a living.

26
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,199
Let's help her

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
as much as we can.

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,000
No wonder the servants
praise you for your generosity.

29
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,919
She set you up.

30
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,919
Don't you hate her?

31
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,599
Haven't you

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
already got justice for me?

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
I was able to make a decision

34
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,930
because you have
solid reasons and evidence.

35
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,879
When

36
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,159
I was in Ping City,

37
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,599
I bear the stigma
of being the daughter of a murderer.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,080
The old maids and servants

39
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,280
around me

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,639
bullied me,

41
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,240
so

42
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,400
I was prepared

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,919
for these.

44
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,159
Madam Li was wrong

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
to set you up.

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,800
But did the incense explode

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,520
because Father and Mother were mad?

48
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,599
Maybe.

49
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,439
Or maybe something's wrong
with the incense Madam Li gave me.

50
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,520
What do you think?

51
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,280
Huaizhou.

52
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,360
Qianyu.

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,280
Huaizhou.

54
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,719
Qianyu just returned to Hu City.

55
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,390
It's boring for her
to stay at home alone.

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,319
Why not

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,120
let Qianyu hold a ball

58
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,560
and let everyone has some fun?

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,719
Sure.

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,439
Thanks for thinking of me.

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,439
Huaizhou.

62
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,680
Don't worry.

63
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll prepare it well and won't embarrass
you and the Gu family.

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,599
Okay.

65
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,080
Thank you then.

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,000
Lin Qianyu.

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,919
Go to hell!

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,680
Miss, I already informed everyone.

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,560
Now everyone knows

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,479
that this ball

71
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,719
is prepared
for the daughter of a murderer.

72
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,800
No one dares to attend it.

73
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,560
She will be embarrassed by then.

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,959
Good job.

75
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,079
Here's your reward.

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,800
Thank you, Miss.

77
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,480
Speaking of which,

78
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
what has this wench been doing lately?

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,879
How come I don't see her?

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
That country bumpkin

81
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,680
shops for clothes every day.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,199
She said

83
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,079
she's preparing for the ball.

84
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,040
Shop for clothes?

85
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,600
I'll see who she will wear them for.

86
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,920
Burn that thing.

87
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,879
Okay, Miss.

88
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,120
Where's everyone?

89
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,480
Do you even need to ask?

90
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,079
Everyone thinks
she's the daughter of a murderer

91
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,240
and refuses to come.

92
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,399
If there's

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,000
any neglect in etiquette,

94
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,879
people will be
even less willing to come.

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,399
She has humiliated

96
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,519
the Gu family.

97
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,040
I'll tell you one last time.

98
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't let me hear you
call Qianyu that again.

99
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,600
Come inside.

100
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,920
Mr. Gu.

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,879
Mr. Zhang.

102
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:27,759
You came.

103
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,439
Long time no see.

104
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,199
What's going on?

105
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,980
Didn't you say
that you've informed everyone?

106
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,920
I did tell everyone.

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
You're useless.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,399
Scram.

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,199
Mr. Gu.

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,920
Sitang, you're here.

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,199
Didn't I inform you?

112
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,490
Didn't you say you're not coming?

113
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,990
Didn't you write to me
that the Gu family wants to use the ball

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,270
to find a bride for Commander Gu

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,279
and asked me to introduce myself
to Commander Gu?

116
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,000
Li Sitang, what's wrong with you?

117
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,720
You mentioned that I was the only one
and that you liked me the most

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,780
in the letter you wrote to me.

119
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,590
I was also the only one
you're setting up with him.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,920
Why are they here?

121
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,279
Li Sitang.

122
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,040
How many best friends do you have?

123
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:01,879
I...

124
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,959
What letter?

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,560
You...

126
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,800
Stop pretending.

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,959
How come
I never realize you were like this?

128
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,920
Yeah.

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
Why are you here?

130
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,680
Where did you come from?

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,970
Does it concern you
that I return to my own home?

132
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,150
You...

133
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,800
Sitang.

134
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,120
Don't be rude.

135
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,759
Gu Manor will always be Jingzhou's home.

136
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
Jingzhou is City Defense Commander now.

137
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,959
It's an honor

138
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,519
for the Gu family that he can come.

139
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,439
You're too kind.

140
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,839
I'm here

141
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,079
to have some fun with the heiresses.

142
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:37,680
Go ahead.

143
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,959
Commander.

144
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,519
You're so tall.

145
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,420
You're so handsome.

146
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,920
What have you been busy with recently?

147
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,199
Would you like a drink?

148
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,240
Drink with me.

149
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,079
I need a dancing partner.

150
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,560
Which of you will help me?

151
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,920
I'll do it.

152
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,519
Me first. Let me.

153
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,160
Me first.

154
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,560
Let me.

155
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,319
Commander.

156
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,040
Let me...

157
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,000
Mrs. Gu is so pretty.

158
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,160
No wonder
Mr. Gu insisted on marrying her.

159
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,600
Jingzhou.

160
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,199
Huaizhou.

161
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,040
Let's dance.

162
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,120

Jingzhou has been fighting in war
in the past few years,

179
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
but his dancing skills haven't declined.

180
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,919
What do you think?

181
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,559
Isn't Jingzhou pretty good at dancing?

182
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,879
Jingzhou is indeed
pretty good at dancing.

183
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,840
I guess

184
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,559
he often dances with heiresses.

185
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
Qianyu is also good at dancing.

186
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,519
I wonder
which gentleman you learned it from.

187
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,039
I remember

188
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,880
that the opening dance
performed by Commander Gu and Ms. Fu

189
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,759
at Commander Gu's birthday party
five years ago was a sensation.

190
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,279
I remember.

191
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,799
Ms. Fu also wore a riding outfit
at the time.

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,799
Yeah.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Let's stop talking about it.

194
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,879
Let's drink.

195
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,000
Come on. Let's drink.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,799
Let's drink.

197
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm going to the washroom.

198
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,720
Okay.

199
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,399
Huaizhou.

200
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,960
We haven't danced yet.

201
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,159
Let's dance.

202
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,679
I want to take a break.

203
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,399
Dance with someone else first.

204
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,080
We haven't even danced.

205
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,559
I'm so mad.

206
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,240
