00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,420
=Episode 12=

4
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,480
You're making a soup yourself.

6
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,400
How thoughtful.

7
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,840
Those who don't know

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,840
might think
you've fallen in love with Gu Huaizhou.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,320
Do you have a lot of free time?

10
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,280
I'm here to ask
if you've thought about it.

11
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,400
It's not too late to confess.

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,420
I've already said
everything that needs to be said.

13
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,319
You don't believe me.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,900
What can I do about it?

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,239
Mr. Chen sent someone
to repair the roof today.

16
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,359
Is it your idea?

17
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,439
Don't mention it.

18
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,439
Do you think you can get rid of me

19
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,599
after you fix the roof?

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Don't forget.

21
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,919
Gu Manor is my home.

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,800
No one can make me leave

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
if I don't want to.

24
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,360
Suit yourself.

25
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,280
Stop causing trouble.

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,199
Don't pester me.

27
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,479
I

28
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,840
refuse to work
with people who aren't sincere.

29
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,560
Anyway,

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
we're allies.

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,879
Here.

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,719
Today, we'll drink soup instead of wine.

33
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,340
After we drink it,

34
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,520
you'll go your way

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,319
while I'll go mine.

36
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,280
What's the matter?

37
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,199
Do you refuse?

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
You may leave.

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,639
(How come it tastes like mushrooms?)

40
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,919
Where are you going?

41
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,380
What's the matter?
Are you rushing to inform Gu Huaizhou

42
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,000
as soon as we end our alliance?

43
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,599
I need to go to the bathroom.

44
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,560
Gu Jingzhou.

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,590
What are you doing?

46
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,439
Let me go.

47
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,599
Who are you?

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,080
Speak!

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,879
Xue.

50
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,639
You're Xue, aren't you?

51
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm not.

52
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,639
I'm not Fu Zhaoxue.

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm Lin Qianyu!

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,290
Five years ago, you were hospitalized
in Ping City for your injuries.

55
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,639
Lu Heng's injured and disfigured cousin
was in the same hospital as you.

56
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,279
But his cousin went missing

57
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,820
when you were discharged
from the hospital.

58
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,360
That's Dr. Lu Heng's private matter.

59
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,690
What does it have to do with me?

60
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,920
Let me go.

61
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,120
You look different than before,

62
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,560
but the way you pour tea
is the same as before.

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,040
That's why you recognized me
on the first day at the hotel.

64
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,120
You know the Gu family inside out.

65
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,879
Wearing the riding outfit
was also part of your plan.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
Even your dancing moves are the same.

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,639
You're Xue.

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
You're Xue!

69
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm not.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Gu Jingzhou, you've lost your mind!

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
You're allergic to mushrooms.

72
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,519
Gu Jingzhou.

73
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,519
How could there be such a coincidence?

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

75
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,079
Let me go!

76
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,160
Xue.

77
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:15,920

Xue!

80
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,639
It's my fault.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,560
It's my fault.

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,170
Open the door!

83
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,639

84
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,759
Dr. Lu!

85
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,600
What happened to her?

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,720

Speak.

How is my wife?

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,959
Don't need to worry too much.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,490
Mrs. Gu just had an allergic reaction.

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,959
She's in stable condition now.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,519
Okay.

112
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,199
Why do you have an allergic reaction
all of a sudden?

113
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,040
Maybe I ate something by mistake.

114
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,079
It's not a big deal.

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't worry.

116
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,559
Did Gu Jingzhou do something to you?

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,320
No.

118
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,990
It was fortunate
that Jingzhou was at home

119
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,360
and sent me to the clinic in time.

120
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,600
Huaizhou.

121
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,559
You must thank Jingzhou.

122
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,790
All that matters is that you're okay.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,879
Jingzhou

124
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,679
isn't an outsider.

125
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,440
Rest well.

126
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,399
Mr. Gu.

127
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,879
Speak.

128
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
The business firm called.

129
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,919
You might need to take care of it.

130
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,360
I'm fine.

131
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,360
Go to work first.

132
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,200
With Dr. Lu here,
you have nothing to worry about.

133
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:22,960
Jingzhou.

134
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,480
Thank you.

135
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,120
Xue.

136
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,919
I told you

138
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,639
that I'm not your Xue.

139
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,120
I won't mistake you for someone else.

140
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,000
You're allergic to mushrooms.

141
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,600
Many people have mushroom allergies.

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
Is everyone Fu Zhaoxue?

143
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,890
What about Lu Heng?

144
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,759
Did he save you

145
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,240
and gave you plastic surgery?

146
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,120
You have such a wild imagination.

147
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
Why won't you admit your identity?

148
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,440
(So what if I admit it?)

149
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,840
(Give you a chance)

150
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,919
(to kill me again?)

151
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,720
I regret it all these years.

152
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,919
I regret sending you back that day.

153
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,120
My father told me

154
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,879
you sent Fu Zhaoxue home

155
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,919
and to her death

156
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,759
on the day

157
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,480
the Fu family was killed.

158
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,120
You should take your own life

159
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,120
and repent to her in hell.

160
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,679
I know you hate me,

161
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,919
but I hate myself too.

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,120
I hate myself
for failing to protect you.

163
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,639
When I sent you home that day,

164
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,240
I was in a hurry to go home

165
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,799
to discuss our wedding date
with my father.

166
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,159
Before leaving Gu Manor,

167
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,399
I saw it.

168
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,759
I saw Huaizhou confessing to you.

169
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,840
I have always considered you
more than just a sister.

170
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,720
Give me a chance.

171
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,679
Give me a reason to keep you.

172
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,879
Huaizhou.

173
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,799
Jingzhou and I are engaged.

174
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,990
It's inappropriate for you
to say these things.

175
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
I saw Huaizhou confessing to you.

176
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,879
I was scared.

177
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,240
I wanted to hold our wedding soon.

178
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,120
Did you know?

179
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,080
I went home

180
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,320
and told my father about our wedding.

181
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,879
Father readily agreed

182
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,759
and said he would go to Mr. Fu

183
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,000
to discuss our wedding date
the next day.

184
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,039
I was so happy.

185
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,320
I want to tell you
the good news as soon as possible.

186
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
I called you

187
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,039
but couldn't get through to you.

188
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
So I wanted to go to Fu Residence
to find you.

189
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,720
But I didn't expect
to be locked at home.

190
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,559
I couldn't get out,

191
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,039
so I could only climb out of the window.

192
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,200
I limped to Fu Residence.

193
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,440
All I saw was flames.

194
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,799
I wanted to rush in,

195
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,360
but the guards stopped me.

196
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,039
They stopped me!

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,440
Get back.

198
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,480
Get back.

199
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,000
Xue.

200
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,440
Get back.

201
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,600
Xue.

202
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,240
Xue!

203
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:11,879
Get back.

204
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,440
Let me in.

205
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,639
Let me in.

206
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,320
Let me in!

207
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
I went home

208
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,080
and saw Lin Fan kneeling on the ground.

209
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,600
He said

210
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
he colluded with the Fu family
to smuggle

211
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,480
and furiously

212
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,680
killed the entire Fu family because
of the unequal distribution of spoils.

213
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,039
I don't believe
the Fu family would smuggle,

214
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,480
so I had a big fight with my father.

215
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,759
I then left Gu Manor.

216
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,759
Because the smuggling route
is from Hu City to Huai City,

217
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,320
I went to Huai City
to seek refuge with General Zheng.

218
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I came back this time

219
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,960
to destroy
the Gu family's smuggling route

220
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,399
and bring down General Zheng

221
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,759
to avenge the Fu family.

222
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,720
Commander Gu.

223
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,720
You love Ms. Fu

224
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,799
very much.

225
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,960
Don't beat yourself up too much.

226
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,000
If Ms. Fu

227
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,840
knows how you feel,

228
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,600
she won't blame you

229
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,840
for what the Gu family

230
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,159
had done.

231
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,480
Okay.

232
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,690
Still refusing to admit it, aren't you?

233
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,200
Okay.

234
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,879
Xue has a snowflake birthmark
on her back.

235
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,679
Do you dare show it to me?

236
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,879
Gu Jingzhou.

237
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,480
Haven't you tortured me enough today?

238
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,519
You're scared to show me.

239
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,879
You're guilty.

240
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,080
You're Xue,

241
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,279
aren't you?

242
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,759
I told you.

243
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,399
I'm not Fu Zhaoxue.

244
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,320
Let me go.

245
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,320
I already lost you once.

246
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,360
I can't lose you a second time!

247
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,039
Gu Jingzhou.

248
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,279
Let go!

249
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,879
Gu Jingzhou, let go!

250
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,600
Gu Jingzhou, you jerk!

251
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,080
Qianyu.

252
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,480
Are you okay?

253
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,320
I don't care if you admit it.

254
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,919
I know you're Xue.

255
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,039
Okay.

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,559
I'll prove it to you.

Sorry.

260

I don't want

261
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,919
to get between you two because of me.

262
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,519

that I'm the late Ms. Fu,
