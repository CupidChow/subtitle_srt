=Episode 15=

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,439
You useless fool.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,479
You can't even catch up
with her, can you?

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm incompetent.

7
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,319
Did you see

8
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,959
who took her away?

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,240
The car curtain blocked my view.

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,519
I didn't see clearly.

11
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,239
What's the license plate number?

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,280
It was also concealed.

13
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,519
Ms. Zheng.

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,000
Ms. Zheng.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,359
Come in.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
I went shopping today

17
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,640
and brought you some supplements.

18
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm in good health.

19
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,359
I don't need supplements.

20
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,640
I'm so envious

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,040
that you're in good health.

22
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,690
Unlike me, who has low red blood cells
and low blood sugar.

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,760
I faint easily.

24
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,520
I also almost fainted
in the garden yesterday.

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,159
Fortunately, Jingzhou helped me.

26
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:15,919
Is that so?

27
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,400
Jingzhou held you so tightly.

28
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,719
I thought you two
were seeing each other behind my back.

29
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,479
Ms. Zheng.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,039
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,479
Huaizhou
is the only one I have eyes for.

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,879
Besides,

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,000
Jingzhou is yours.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
How dare I go after him?

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,919
Okay.

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,199
Since

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,879
you're not interested in Jingzhou,

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,439
why don't you do me a favor?

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,719
Sure.

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,240
I wonder

41
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,560
how I can help you.

42
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,879
I want to sleep with him.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,000
By drugging him?

44
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,840
This method...

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,000
What's wrong with this method?

46
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,960
I told you

47
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,639
I, Zheng Yuzhen, will get

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,479
anyone I want,

49
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,159
no matter what it takes.

50
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,860

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,100
(Hu City's City Defense Department)

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,159
Commander.

53
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,010
Yesterday,
I checked General Zheng's guards

54
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,840
as per your instructions.

55
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,199
The murderer who wiped
out the Fu family is on it.

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,080
Find a way to pass this list to Lu Heng.

57
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,240
Do it secretly.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,759
If I'm not mistaken,

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,340
she's going to the clinic
to see Lu Heng today

60
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,080
for this matter.

61
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:52,960
Commander.

62
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,560
Why are you doing this?

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
You risked your life for the Fu family,

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,960
but she doesn't appreciate it at all.

65
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,520
You might as well...

66
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,319
I'll do it right away.

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,919
Ms...

68
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,199
Ms. Lin.

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,879
You came.

70
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,090
What are you doing here?

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,439
I brought you some ginseng soup.

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,480
Didn't you tell me

73
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,480
to stay away from you?

74
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,399
Why are you bringing me soup now?

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,079
You helped me.

76
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,800
This soup

77
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,279
is for you.

78
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,680
You don't look so good.

79
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,600
Here.

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,450
Let's drink it together.

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,270
It can also nourish your body.

82
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,519
No thanks.

83
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,390
You can drink it yourself.

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,600
Feed me if you mean it.

85
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,720
Otherwise, take it back.

86
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,340
I'll reach
Commander's Department at 4 PM.

87
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
You just need to deliver
the drugged soup

88
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,759
to Jingzhou a few minutes in advance

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
and leave.

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,079
Drink it yourself.

91
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,199
What are you doing?

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
Someone will see us.

93
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,160
Let go of me.

94
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,800
Someone?

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,560
Who?

96
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
My brother or Zheng Yuzhen?

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,560
Speak.

98
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,240
What did Zheng Yuzhen ask you to do?

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
What did you add in the soup?

100
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,680
Speak.

101
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:36,959
Gu Jingzhou.

102
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm only here to deliver you soup.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,079
Let me go.

104
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,990
She asked me
to drug you with aphrodisiac.

105
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,959
She wants to sleep with you.

106
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,839
So you delivered me soup

107
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,279
just to offer me
as a token of loyalty to her?

108
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,879
It's just to appease her.

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,959
I didn't mean it.

110
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,639
Appease?

111
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,759
How could you

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,240
send another woman to my bed
just to appease someone?

113
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,639
I can accompany you
to do anything you want.

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,759
If you want my heart and my life,

115
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,920
I can give it to you.

116
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,879
But you can't do this to me.

117
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,399
I didn't.

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,600
Then why did you drug me?

119
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,000
I just added some sleeping drugs

120
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,120

Why is Jingzhou so angry?

151
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,279
Jingzhou made a big fuss
at my wedding with Huaizhou

152
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
before.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,919

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,240
I couldn't help you.

167

for Old Master Gu is over.

Mr. Gu

174
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,559
is moving back
to Mrs. Gu's room tonight.

175
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,159
He asked me to make preparations.

176
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,559
I see.

177
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,519

What are you wandering about for?

183
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,639
Didn't I ask why you're wandering...

184
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,039
Wandering...

185
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,240

186
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,360

187
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,960
Why are you still awake?

188
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,519
Aren't you still awake too?

189
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,000

00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,519
Anytime,

193
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,279
but not now.

194
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,399
Qianyu has been waiting
in the room for a long time.

195
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,799
Jingzhou.

196
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,639
There's no rush

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,480
to divide the fortune.

198
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,679
What a coincidence.

199
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,919
You're busy every time I talk to you.

200
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,440
What's the point in delaying?

201
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,360
I don't mean to delay it.

202
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,279
We can talk about it.

203
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,759
But I'll be frank with you.

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,279
There's no way

205
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,559
I'm giving you the shipping business.

206
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,159
Didn't I tell you?

207
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,159
I don't want anything else

208
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,360
but the shipping business.

209
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,080
We have nothing to talk about then.

210
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,799
Wait.

211
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,950
It's not that we can't discuss it.

212
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,159
Why not

213
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,320
come to my room?

214
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,320
We can discuss it.
