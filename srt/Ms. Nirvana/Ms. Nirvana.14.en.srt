1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,660
=Ms. Nirvana=

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 14=

4
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,319
Put the things back in my room.

5
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,560
I want to have afternoon tea
with Qianyu.

6
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,840
Okay, Miss.

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,159
The weather is so nice today.

8
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,480
Qianyu.

9
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,359
Isn't it bitter if you don't add sugar?

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,480
I used to like adding a lot of sugar
just like you.

11
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,280
Later, I realized

12
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,879
that coffee is bitter.

13
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,480
Adding sugar

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,599
doesn't mask its own flavor.

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,920
Adding sugar

16
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,200
is just fooling yourself.

17
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,640
I don't see it that way.

18
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,040
As long as I add enough sugar,

19
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,200
it will be sweet.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,640
Is that so?

21
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,439
Are you that confident?

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,400
Of course.

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,079
Growing up,

24
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,159
I always get

25
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,640
the things and the people

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,439
I want.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,199
Just like Jingzhou.

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,759
Didn't he have a fiancée?

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,199
Isn't he

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,719
mine now?

31
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,080
My father killed his sweetheart.

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,280
In that case,

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,159
my father

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,159
is the one
who made your engagement happen.

35
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,400
Qianyu.

36
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,479
Are you really Lin Fan's daughter?

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Of course.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Aren't you a too simple?

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
It wasn't Lin Fan who made
my engagement to Jingzhou possible.

40
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,000
It's myself.

41
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,159
I asked my father

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,879
to wipe out the Fu family.

43
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,479
The first time I met Jingzhou

44
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,639
was at his 18th birthday party.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,439
Are you okay?

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,879
Sorry.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,159
Wait.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,719
I've decided

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,159
to make you my dancing partner tonight.

50
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,879
Sorry.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
I already have a dance partner.

52
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,560
You...

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,919
Jingzhou.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
Let's dance.

55
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,080
Sure.

56
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,120
So I asked my father

57
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,240
to wipe out the Fu family,

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,439
especially Fu Zhaoxue.

59
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,080
She must die.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,960
Qianyu.

61
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,680
Are you listening?

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,719
I am.

63
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,280
Go on.

64
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,960
Your father

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,039
led my father's guards

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,560
into Fu Residence at night

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,960
and killed the Fu family.

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Speaking of which,

69
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,319
the bodyguard who escorted me here

70
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,439
is the one

71
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,879
who killed Chief Fu.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,719
You killed his fiancée?

73
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,079
After you get married,

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,879
will you sleep well

75
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,000
next to him?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,680
Qianyu.

77
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,839
Aren't you also sleeping
next to Gu Huaizhou?

78
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,720
Are you able to sleep well?

79
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,759
I don't think so.

80
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,079
My father has been testing Jingzhou
for the past five years.

81
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,879
He has completely forgotten

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,839
about that darn woman.

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,399
Besides,

84
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,920
the most important thing for a man
is his career.

85
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,959
Young romance

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,279
is like bubbles

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,079
that disappear in an instant.

88
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,879
There aren't so many

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,279
hopeless romantics in this world.

90
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,759
Since there aren't so many
hopeless romantics in this world,

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,560
why are you so fixated on Gu Jingzhou?

92
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,839
He's different.

93
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,800
He's the one I want,

94
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,040
so I must have him.

95
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,879
It doesn't matter

96
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,439
how long I can have him.

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,079
I heard everything you said.

98
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,040
Xue.

99
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,120
You're crying for the Fu family

100
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,839
and Chief Fu.

101
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,180
♪The burning heat is nothing more♪

102
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,639
I repeat.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm not Fu Zhaoxue.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,199
She's already dead.

105
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,980
♪Turning around decisively
at this moment♪

106
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,660
♪Whose innocence is taken?♪

107
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,700
♪Ask yourself♪

108
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,519
(It will break)

109
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,959
(over time.)

110
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,000
(Not only young romance)

111
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,439
(but also memory.)

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
(I can't remember)

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,839
(what I use)

114
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,639
(to look like.)

115
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,040
Huaizhou.

116
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,199
Huaizhou.

117
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,519
You're drunk.

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm sober!

119
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,079
You're my wife.

120
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,600
I've wanted you for a long time.

121
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,639
Look at me.

122
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,560
Look at me!

123
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,639
I'm your husband.

124
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,399
Why are you crying?

125
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,519
Speak.

126
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,439
Speak!

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,319
You're my husband

128
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,839
and the only person I can rely on,

129
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,920
but you keep doubting me.

130
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,040
Why do you think I'm crying?

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,839
Why did I

132
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,360
saw you with Gu Jingzhou

133
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,399
this afternoon?

134
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,439
You know why!

135
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,160
It's not the first time
he has pestered me.

136
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
I already told you

137
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
to kick him out of Gu Manor,

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
but what did you do?

139
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,360
How dare you ask me now?

140
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,839
Sorry.

141
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
I was too impulsive.

142
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,279
When I was little,

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,560
my father abandoned me and my mother

144
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,399
to climb up the social ladder.

145
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,159
My mother remarried
and took me to the Gu family.

146
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,200
Since I was little,

147
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,159
I'm the one who handles all the mess
in the Gu family's business.

148
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,279
And Gu Jingzhou is always
the glorious second young master.

149
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,759
I can give him anything,

150
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,039
but the person I like only likes him.

151
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,120
(So)

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,519
(you killed the person you like)

153
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,600
(and her entire family.)

154
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,399
Fortunately,

155
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,559
god was watching

156
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
and let me met you.

157
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,559
So Qianyu,

158
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,600
don't you ever betray me.

159
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,279
As long as you're willing,

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,799
I will never leave you.

161
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,240
Huaizhou.

162
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,039
Wait.

163
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,080
You refuse?

164
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
No way.

165
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,840
I just

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,360
had my period these two days,

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,120
so it's not convenient.

168
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,039
It doesn't matter.

169
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,879
We have a lifetime.

170
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,919
I can wait a few days.

171
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,200
Tomorrow,

172
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,519
I'll ask the kitchen to prepare
something that will warm you up.

173
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:13,879
Okay.

174
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,879
It's late.

175
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,480
Huaizhou.

176
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,559
Why don't you rest here?

177
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,990
It was General Zheng's guards
who killed your family?

178
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,360
He's Zheng Yuzhen's bodyguard.

179
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,639
He was the one

180
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,759
who killed my father.

181
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
Use him to find out

182
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,240
the list of guards who killed my family

183
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,200
and evidence.

184
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,279
Okay.

185
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,279
General Zheng is extremely powerful.

186
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,639
Zheng Yuzhen is also crazy.

187
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,399
Don't be too adventurous.

188
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't worry.

189
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,399
I won't be reckless.

190
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,639
Gu Jingzhou.

191
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,720
What are you doing?

192
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,990
You're being followed
by Zheng Yuzhen's staff.

193
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,279
Why is she following me?

194
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,519
She saw us.

195
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,840
Gu Jingzhou.

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,919
I warn you

197
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,720
to stay away from me.

198
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,480
In what capacity are you saying this?

199
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,879
Qianyu or Xue?

200
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,120
If you're Xue,

201
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,919
leave Gu Huaizhou

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,039
and let me protect you.

203
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,360
Gu Jingzhou.

204
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,279
You've really lost your mind.

205
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't want you to leave me again.

206
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,440
