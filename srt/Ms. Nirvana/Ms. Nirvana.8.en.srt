Yes.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,159
Indeed.

7
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:16,840
Good wine.

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,200
That's right.

9
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,120
Miss.

10
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,519
Where are you going?

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,560
Get lost.

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,300
Do you want to
come to my house for a drink?

13
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,239
Do you know who I am?

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,879
I'm Mrs. Gu.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,840
Mrs. Gu?

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,359
I don't care whose missus you are.

17
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,439
You're mine tonight.

18
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,439
Get lost!

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,120
You're quite hot-tempered.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,159
I like women like you.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Go away!

22
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,799
Get lost!

23
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,159
Arrest all of them!

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,640
Yes.

25
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,120
Are you okay?

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,319

You're awake.

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,240
Where am I?

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
Why am I here?

39
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,000
Qianyu.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
Is your memory that bad?

41
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,840
Last night,

42
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,159
we...

43
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,599
Yeah.

44
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,680
You hugged me so tight last night.

45
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,959
Gu Jingzhou.

46
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,079
You're shameless.

47
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
You've seduced me so many times.

48
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Why are you still pretending
to be innocent?

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Gu Jingzhou.

50
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,040
You're despicable.

51
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,040
Trying to slap me?

52
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,639
You should thank me.

53
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you?

54
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,040
Thank you for taking advantage of me?

55
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,759
Qianyu.

56
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,639
You button.

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
This is your shirt, isn't it?

58
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,920
Give me back my clothes.

59
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:36,800
Thank me.

60
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,240
I should indeed thank you.

61
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,680
Li Sitang told me.

62
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,200
You didn't take the nude photos,

63
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,319
but

64
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,399
why didn't you tell me?

65
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,600
Does it matter?

66
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,680
Of course not.

67
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,000
After all, I'm just a partner

68
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,199
to you.

69
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,639
Helping me

70
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,759
is equivalent to helping yourself.

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,079
Yes.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,720
You're right.

73
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,950
We wouldn't be working together

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,879
if it weren't for her.

75
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:15,839
Get changed.

76
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,000
You're right here.

77
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,639
How can I get changed?

78
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,480
Speaking of which,

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,959
I didn't sleep here last night.

80
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,720
Also,

81
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,399
the female cook

82
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,000
at Commander's Headquarters
changed your clothes.

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Pervert.

84
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,439
Commander.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,340
Six ships that were smuggling firearms
have been hijacked.

86
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,920
Who hijacked them?

87
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,120
We don't know.

88
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,260
Our men robbing
the smuggler's ships last night said

89
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,480
they seem professional,

90
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,460
unlike regular robbers.

91
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:29,800
Got it.

92
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,199
I've folded your shirt.

93
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,839
What are you trying to do now?

94
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,519
Six ships that were smuggling firearms
were hijacked.

95
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,240
You're the only other person who knows

96
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,570
about the shipping route map.

97
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,199
Are you suspecting me?

98
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,230
What do you think?

99
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,399
Gu Jingzhou.

100
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,519
We're allies.

101
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
We have a deal.

102
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,639
Once we get the Gu family's fortune,

103
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,319
the shipping business is yours
and the rest is mine.

104
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,360
Why would I steal firearms

105
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,919
from you?

106
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,960
Looks like you won't admit it.

107
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,519
Why would I admit
to something I haven't done?

108
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,399
Instead of suspecting me,

109
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,320
why not investigate it?

110
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,840
Do you think you're the only one

111
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,490
who wants the Gu family's business?

112
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,600
Very well.

113
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,120
You better not let me

114
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,519
find anything on you.

115
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,159
Thank you for saving me last night.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,960
Send someone to investigate Lin Qianyu.

117
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,120
Are you suspecting her?

118
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,759
No average organization

119
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,440
can rob six shiploads of firearms.

120
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
If Lin Qianyu is involved,

121
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,159
she wants more

122
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
than just
a division of the Gu family's fortune.

123
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,679
Got it. I'll investigate her right away.

124
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,240
Also,

125
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,759
find out everything you can about her
from birth to now,

126
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
especially her life in Ping City
five years ago.

127
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,480
I want to know everything.

128
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,559
Yes.

129
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,399
These six ships of firearms

130
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,040
must be transported to the frontline
as soon as possible

131
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,370
to support the revolutionary army.

132
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,200
I'll make sure of it.

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,890
But Gu Jingzhou led Commander's Department
to arrest the revolutionary party.

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,360
Our men were arrested.

135
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,080
I worry...

136
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,559
Don't worry.

137
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,759
I'll find a way to rescue them.

138
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,799
I'll leave first.

139
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,159
Gu Jingzhou

140
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,399
robbed smuggled materials

141
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,240
while arresting our comrades

142
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
to create an alibi for himself.

143
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
He's really cunning.

144
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:35,919
Otherwise,

145
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,399
it wouldn't have taken him
only five years

146
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,879
to become
Hu City's City Defense Commander.

147
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,720
Smuggled firearms' hijack

148
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,360
made him suspect me.

149
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,519
However,

150
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,080
he has no solid evidence yet.

151
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,799
We're well prepared.

152
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,160
Gu Jingzhou
shouldn't be able to find anything.

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,039
To be honest,

154
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,470
I'm more worried that Gu Huaizhou
will do something bad to you.

155
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,759
Don't worry.

156
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,440
I'll be careful.

157
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,039
Besides, haven't we

158
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,480
taken down someone?

159
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,679
I thought you saved Madam Li to...

160
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:09,960
You didn't expect

161
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,080
that I kept her

162
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,759
to torture Li Sitang, did you?

163
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,250
Those who colluded with each other
to harm others

164
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,360
ended up torturing each other.

165
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,360
Isn't this a way to give them

166
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,039
a taste of their own medicine?

167
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,519
What about your next target?

168
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,600
Who's next?

169
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,799
Zhao Zhong

170
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,159
betrayed my father

171
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,759
and the Fu family

172
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,759
for money.

173
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,080
Now that the smuggling ship
was hijacked,

174
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,039
we should take this opportunity

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,159
to muddy the waters.

176
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,919
His good days

177
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,759
