1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,660
=Ms. Nirvana=

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 2=

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,600
Qianyu.

5
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,679
Kiss me.

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,960
Qianyu, open the door.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,680
Huaizhou.

8
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,439
Give me a minute.

9
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,159
I'm taking a bath.

10
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,400
Okay.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,990
You can take a bath first.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,810
I'll come back later.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,280
Huaizhou.

14
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,400
I've finished bathing.

15
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,780
You should take a bath too.

16
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,520
Huaizhou.

17
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,120
You've had a tiring day.

18
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,360
How about taking a bath?

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
You keep staring at me.

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Is there something wrong?

21
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,599
Why

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,360
is your neck red?

23
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,719
I probably wiped myself
too hard just now.

24
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,560
I'll run the bath for you.

25
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,199
No, thanks.

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,570
I'll sleep in the study.

27
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
Huaizhou.

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,599
I know you married me
because of Father's will.

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
The wedding is over now.

30
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,840
I don't want to give you a hard time.

31
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,840
You can consider our marriage
as a mere formality.

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,879
I want nothing

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,159
but to live a peaceful life.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,840
Ms. Lin.

35
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,840
Mr. Lin asked me to give you this.

36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
Rest in Ping City.

37
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,280
The Gu family will take care of you.

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,319
(They're the same person.)

39
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,199
(Why is her temperament
so different from before?)

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,599
You seem

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,240
to have changed a lot.

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,960
Really?

43
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,640
Maybe because
I lived under someone else's roof

44
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,000
and depended on others,

45
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,879
so my temperament

46
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,079
has changed a lot
due to the environment.

47
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,639
What kind of environment

48
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,680
allowed you to not only
remain calm in the face of danger

49
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,079
but also turn the tables

50
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,959
when my brother threatened you?

51
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,759
Huaizhou.

52
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,170
I don't want to lie to you,

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
but I pretended to be calm.

54
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,519
I know the sins my father has committed.

55
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,500
That's why I don't want to bring trouble
to you and the Gu family,

56
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,120
even if I risk my life.

57
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,319
Thank you.

58
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
It's getting late.

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,800
Go back and rest.

60
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,519
I will announce to the public

61
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,720
that we're still mourning my father,

62
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,950
so we'll sleep
in separate rooms for now.

63
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,920
The Gu brothers
didn't doubt my identity.

64
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,480
Everything is going well.

65
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm not eating.

66
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,040
I won't eat anything.

67
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,370
Huaizhou doesn't want me anymore.

68
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,199
I should just die.

69
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,720
Miss.

70
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,920
Calm down.

71
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,800
Come here.

72
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,000
You hide in this room all day

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,959
without eating or drinking.

74
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,920
How can your body stand it?

75
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,319
Why did Uncle insist on Huaizhou

76
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,079
marrying that witch, Lin Qianyu?

77
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,959
I'm the one who has been with Huaizhou
since childhood.

78
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,040
They had a blissful night.

79
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,519
But what about me?

80
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,839
Listen to me.

81
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,800
Mr. Gu slept in his study

82
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,399
last night.

83
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,240
He didn't share a room with Lin Qianyu.

84
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Really?

85
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,040
Of course.

86
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
You know

87
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,560
he's filial.

88
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,959
He obeyed Old Master Gu's wishes

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,480
and married Lin Qianyu,

90
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,399
but he's still mourning Old Master Gu.

91
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,839
He won't sleep with Lin Qianyu

92
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,399
during this period.

93
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,439
What happens
when the mourning period is over?

94
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,920
Once they consummated their marriage,

95
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,319
I'm doomed.

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,759
Miss.

97
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,399
Madam Li.

98
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,839
Help me think of a solution.

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,959
You must help me kick Lin Qianyu out.

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Kick her out.

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Don't worry.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,279
I've already

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,480
come up with a solution for you.

104
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,319
Mrs. Gu.

105
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,199
Come in.

106
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,680
Mrs. Gu, you're awake.

107
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,680
Mr. Gu said

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,519
today is your first day of marriage.

109
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,500
You need to meet
the Gu family's relatives later.

110
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,319
You have to dress up nicely.

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Mrs. Gu.

112
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,240
One more thing.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
You're meeting the relatives today.

114
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,759
You should put on makeup.

115
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,319
Got it.

116
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,319
You may leave.

117
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,759
(Don't worry.)

118
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,839
(I'll handle you)

119
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,439
(later.)

120
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:56,980
(Memorial Tablet
of the Gu Family's Ancestors)

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,759
Why is Mrs. Gu not here yet?

122
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,800
Mrs. Gu said she'll come over
after putting on makeup.

123
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,839
Makeup?

124
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,000
Huaizhou.

125
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,399
Everyone came to the morning ceremony
in plain clothes.

126
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,519
Yet she's putting on makeup.

127
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,959
This is too much.

128
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,199
Mr. Chen.

129
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
Go fetch Mrs. Gu.

130
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,920
Yes.

131
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,319
Commander.

132
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,900
I thought
you were busy with military affairs

133
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,959
and wouldn't come.

134
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,320
Gu Jingzhou.

135
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,840
Where are your manners?

136
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,279
Huaizhou is the eldest son

137
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,600
and the head of the Gu family.

138
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,080
How could you light
the first incense stick before Huaizhou?

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,790
Besides, today is the day the new daughter-in-law
meets her in-laws for the first time.

140
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,559
You should wait for Huaizhou and Qianyu
to finish paying respects

141
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,440
before it's your turn.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,639
Gu Jingzhou.

143
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,879
Sitang.

144
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,039
Don't make a scene.

145
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,679
Since Jingzhou
is filial to Father and Mother,

146
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,360
let him be.

147
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,399
I came back today

148
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,840
just to pay respects to my mother.

149
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,720
I've lit up the first incense stick.

150
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
Why is Qianyu not here yet?

151
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,240
What kind of makeup
takes this long to apply?

152
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,720
Even Mr. Chen can't get her to come.

153
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
Mrs. Gu has arrived!

154
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,639
(Gu Zhaoren.)

155
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,720
(Memorial Tablet
of the Gu Family's Ancestors)

156
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,879
(Memorial Tablet of Gu Zhaoren)
(I just regret not killing you myself.)

157
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,639
(I will make you watch from hell)

158
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,519
(as the Gu family heads to destruction.)

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,440
Mrs. Gu.

160
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
Today is your first time paying respects

161
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,660
to Old Master Gu and Old Madam Gu
since you married into Gu Manor.

162
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,639
I, Gu Huaizhou,

163
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,559
brought my wife, Lin Qianyu,

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,840
to meet my ancestors.

165
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,039
Qianyu, are you unwilling to kneel?

166
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,559
Old Master Gu and Old Madam Gu
have passed away,

167
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,519
but you should still follow the rules.

168
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,799
Where did this country girl come from?

169
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,290
She doesn't know the rules.

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,039
I, Lin Qianyu,

171
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,039
am here to meet my in-laws.

172
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,940
(Memorial Tablet
of the Gu Family's Ancestors)

173
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,039
Instead of learning the rules,

174
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
she put on quite the airs.

175
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,799
Looks like we servants

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,960
won't be having good days ahead.

177
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,990
It must be because Mrs. Gu was late
for the morning ceremony

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,160
and didn't follow the rules.

179
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,080
Old Master Gu and Old Madam Gu are mad.

180
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,220
Huaizhou.

181
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,630
She caused so much trouble
just after she joined the family.

182
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,519
What a jinx.

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,519
Old Master Gu.

184
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,360
Old Madam Gu.

185
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,120
Please don't blame us.

186
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,360
This is all the jinx's fault.

187
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:19,679
Madam Li.

188
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,519
I wanted to cover it up for you.

189
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,799
But even my in-laws have gone mad,

190
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,799
I could only tell the truth.

191
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,679
Madam Li.

192
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,679
Did you do this?

193
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,879
Look at me.

194
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,919
I'm old and have poor memory.

195
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,990
I forgot we're paying respects
to the ancestors today.

196
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,399
It's all my fault.

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm to be blamed.

198
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,960
According to what you said, you told me
that we're meeting meet relatives

199
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,960
and asked me to put on makeup
before coming over

200
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,200
because you have poor memory.

201
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,759
Wearing red to pay respects
to the ancestors is disrespectful.

202
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,799
No wonder the incense sticks exploded

203
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,080
and disturbed my parents' souls.

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,120
Mr. Chen.

205
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,720
Throw Madam Li out.

206
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,240
Yes.

207
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:09,720
Mr. Gu.

208
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,200
I... I'm sorry.

209
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,900
I've worked for the Gu family
for so many years.

210
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,600
I worked hard, even if I have no merits.

211
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,559
Spare me.

212
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,879
Spare me.

213
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,799
Okay?

214
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,679
Miss, say something for me.

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,639
Huaizhou.

216
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,480
I grew up with Madam Li.

217
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,879
Please spare her

218
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,879
for my sake.

219
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,399
If you just spare her,

220
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
how can I comfort my ancestors?

221
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,320
Gu Jingzhou, shut up.

222
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,159
Jingzhou.

223
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,990
Sitang has always been soft-hearted
and treated people well.

224
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,559
Thanks to her reminder today,

225
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,490
I was able to escape this disaster.

226
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,320
She lent me the white dress I'm wearing.

227
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:41,759
I...

228
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,720
I think she pleaded for Madam Li
out of a momentary soft-heartedness.

229
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,639
Don't argue with her.

230
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,879
Don't you think so?

231
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,679
Sitang.

232
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,600
Ding.

233
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,960
Drag Madam Li away.

234
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,679
Give her 50 beatings

235
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,039
and throw her out.

236
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,519
We can show them

237
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,279
that there's a price to pay

238
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,480
for doing evil in Gu Manor.

239
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,000
No!

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,440
Commander.

241
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,920
She'll be crippled
by these fifty beatings,

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,320
even if she survives.

243
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,720
Commander Gu.

244
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,279
You're magnanimous.

245
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,120
Spare me.

246
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,000
Mr. Gu.

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,240
I'll speak.

248
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,960
I'll come clean.

249
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,159
Miss

250
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,320
instructed me to do all this.

251
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,240
She asked me to help her find a way

252
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,320
to throw Mrs. Gu out.

253
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,759
I'm a servant.

254
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,039
Without her orders,

255
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,360
I wouldn't dare do anything.

256
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,559
Nonsense.

257
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,480
I didn't.

258
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,840
Miss.

259
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,559
Nonsense!

260
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,519
I did all this for you.

261
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,000
You can't ignore me.

262
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,080
Nonsense.

263
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,159
Huaizhou, she's lying.

264
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:44,960
I didn't do it.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,679
Stop!

266
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,840
Mr. Chen.

267
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,120
Throw Madam Li out.

268
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,000
From now on,

269
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,960
she's not allowed to enter Gu Manor.

270
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:54,799
Yes.

271
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,320
Mr. Gu.

272
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,600
I'm innocent.

273
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,240
Come on.

274
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,879
Mr. Gu.

275
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,180
Come on.

276
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm innocent!

277
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,639
Sir!

278
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:18,679
Jingzhou.

279
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,879
This is the women's restroom.

280
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,360
You're indeed the one behind it.

281
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
What are you talking about?

282
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
How come I don't understand?

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,900
If you hadn't sprinkled gunpowder
on the incense sticks

284
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,559
when you lit them up,

285
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,960
why would the incense sticks explode?

286
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,240
That's right.

287
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,000
I did it.

288
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,399
Thanks to your reminder.

289
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,440
Otherwise,

290
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,559
I wouldn't have gotten changed.

291
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,600
Jingzhou.

292
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,639
You wore red and applied heavy makeup
to meet your in-laws.

293
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,720
Qianyu.

294
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,279
How eye-catching.

295
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,360
I reminded you to get changed,

296
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,990
but I didn't ask you
to make the incense sticks explode.

297
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,679
You didn't expose me either.

298
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,320
You even helped me deal with Madam Li.

299
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm helping you
just to complete my plan.

300
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,720
Don't flatter yourself.

301
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,960
Madam Li
was disrespectful to my ancestors.

302
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,240
Of course I won't spare her.

303
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,879
You're so decisive.

304
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,840
No wonder General Zheng favors you.

305
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,799
If I didn't help you today,

306
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,799
you

307
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,679
wouldn't be so smug now, would you?

308
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,120
We cooperated well with each other,

309
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,000
didn't we?

310
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
Would you consider

311
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,200
my suggestion last night?

312
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
Want a share of the cake?

313
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,320
You'll have to prove yourself first.

314
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,440
Okay.

315
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,200
Let's

316
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,840
wait and see.

317
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,679
Go away. Leave me alone!

318
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,320
Why are you here?

319
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,879
Are you here to laugh at me?

320
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,759
Of course not.

321
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,919
I just came to check on you.

322
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,200
I didn't expect

323
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
that cunning servant

324
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,000
to drag you into this.

325
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,600
Do you think I will believe your lies?

326
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,279
Whether you believe me,

327
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,799
as your cousin-in-law,

328
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,679
I have to remind you.

329
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,960
Madam Li

330
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,039
is obviously a troublemaker.

331
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,399
If she

332
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,879
talked nonsense

333
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,279
and ruined your reputation,

334
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,679
it would be troublesome.

335
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
What do you mean by that?

336
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,480
I don't mean anything.

337
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,120
I'm just a little worried about you.

338
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,519
She has served you for years

339
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,480
and knows everything about you.

340
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,480
She was now throw out.

341
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,759
If she

342
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,079
talked nonsense outside...

343
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,599
Stop being so pretentious.

344
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,920
Madam Li was thrown out because of you.

345
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,599
Sitang.

346
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,200
You'll hurt me

347
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,680
by saying that.

348
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,160
I care about the Gu family.

349
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,799
I won't spare

350
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,200
anyone who breaks the rules.

351
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,359
I brought you some snacks.

352
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:32,890
Remember to eat them.

353
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,720
Lin Qianyu.

354
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,240
