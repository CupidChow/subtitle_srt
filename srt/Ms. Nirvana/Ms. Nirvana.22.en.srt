00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 22=

4
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,840
Gu Jingzhou

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
forced a commoner to marry him.

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,079
Give me my fiancée back!

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,240
Gu Jingzhou

8
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,760
forced a commoner to marry him.

9
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,680
Give me my fiancée back!

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,120
Everyone.

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,840
City Defense Commander, Gu Jingzhou,

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,890
used his official position

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,439
to domineeringly

14
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,439
steal my fiancée.

15
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,879
He's deceiving the people!

16
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,640
Everyone

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,200
must help me weigh in on this

18
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,560
and give me justice.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,120
I didn't expect Commander Gu

20
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,159
to be such a man.

21
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,519
Give me justice!

22
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,280
Give me my fiancée back!

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,200
Stop shouting!

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,000
Move out of the way!

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm telling you.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,220
Stop spreading rumors
and causing trouble.

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,719
Commander Gu isn't like that.

28
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,990
He won't do such a thing either.

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,159
This is slander.

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,390
If you speak nonsense again,

31
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,460
and I'll have you arrested.

32
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,190
What's the matter?

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,640
Are you going to arrest me?

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,239
See that?

35
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,480
They're not allowing me

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
to speak in broad daylight.

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,240
Stop shouting!

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:49,680
Have you had enough?

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,840
Help me weigh in on this!

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,760
Li Qifa!

41
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,920
I already told you

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,959
my wife's name is Fu Zhaoxue.

43
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,599
She isn't your fiancée.

44
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,480
Nonsense!

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,760
She's my fiancée, Lin Qianyu.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,239
Everyone knows that.

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
His brother married her first.

48
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,799
Later,

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,879
he snatched her from his brother

50
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,460
and changed her name to Fu Zhaoxue.

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,759
You clearly forged

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,319
the ID you showed me yesterday!

53
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,759
Gu Jingzhou.

54
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,199
Give me my fiancée back!

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Gu Jingzhou.

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,840
Give me my fiancée back!

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,879
Jingzhou.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,360
Li Qifa's incident
caused a stir in the city.

59
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,280
It made the headlines
of all major newspapers.

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,439
The Gu family's business
is also affected.

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,800
Several companies

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,719
have stopped working with the Gu family.

63
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,599
If this goes on,

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,680
it will be very bad for you.

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,039
Haven't we resolved this matter?

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,800
Why is Li Qifa

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,759
making a scene again?

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
I noticed

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,880
him acting suspiciously
on the street just now.

70
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,280
If he really came to find his fiancée,

71
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,240
he should continue talking to us

72
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,360
instead of creating public opinion
and causing panic.

73
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,479
This won't do him any good,

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
so I think it's not that simple.

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
Someone must be behind this.

76
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,719
Jingzhou.

77
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,479
If someone

78
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,960
is really behind this,

79
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,719
they should be after you.

80
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,879
You have to be more careful.

81
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,599
Zhaoxue.

82
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,919
Did I

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,000
scare you just now?

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,759
No.

85
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,079
What can I do for you?

86
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,160
You've

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,170
had a lot on your mind lately.

88
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,839
I know it's because of Li Qifa,

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,560
but don't worry.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,879
I'll settle

91
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,759
this.

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
Do you have a solution?

93
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,839
I didn't want to tell you at first,

94
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,240
but I can't stand

95
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,879
seeing you worry.

96
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm going to get rid of Li Qifa.

97
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,079
Jingzhou!

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,160
Jingzhou.

99
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,759
You're hurt.

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
Are you okay?

101
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,079
Li Qifa is really bold.

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,160
Mr. Chen.

103
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
What are you waiting for?

104
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,079
Get rid of the body.

105
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:43,720
Yes.

106
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,120
Wait.

107
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,680
He's still alive.

108
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,839
Send him to the hospital.

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,279
Li Qifa has caused
a lot of trouble these days.

110
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,959
Not only did he affect your reputation,

111
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,480
but he has also ruined
several deals for the Gu family.

112
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,210
I've already informed Mr. Chen
to have someone get rid of him.

113
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,990
I didn't expect him

114
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,040
to run straight into trouble.

115
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,480
Huaizhou, why didn't you

116
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,879
discuss it with me in advance?

117
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,120
Jingzhou.

118
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,519
You're a commander.

119
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,399
You have now been thrust

120
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,959
into public spotlight.

121
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,560
I can't let you

122
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,879
suffer the consequences.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,079
If it was exposed,

124
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,480
I will bear all the consequences.

125
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,480
Li Qifa is skilled

126
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,240
and doesn't look like
a regular civilian.

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,720
He's

128
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,530
a little like the guy who came
to the clinic to assassinate us,

129
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,600
but it doesn't matter.

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,279
Don't worry.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,399
Tomorrow,

132
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,240
I'll have Ding investigate him.

133
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,160
The surgery is over.

134
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,370
His life is no longer in danger,

135
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,120
but

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
he's still in a coma.

137
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,879
Thank you, Lu.

138
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,160
Take good care of him for me.

139
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,360
When he wakes up,

140
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,990
I have something to ask him.

141
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:05,879
Okay.

142
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,560
Mr. Gu.

143
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,759
What do we do next?

144
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,160
We can't let Li Qifa stay.

145
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,360
But

146
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,839
Li Qifa is currently at Lu's Clinic.

147
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,839
Lu Heng keeps watching him closely.

148
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,360
It's hard for us to do anything.

149
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,720
I don't care what method you use.

150
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,759
You must get rid of him for me.

151
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes.

152
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,759
Mr. Gu.

153
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,160
Commander.

154
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,240
Li Qifa

155
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,319
is really bold.

156
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,399
How dare he assassinate you in Gu Manor?

157
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,959
Li Qifa isn't as simple as we think.

158
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,959
Look him up for me.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
I'll have someone
investigate his identity.

160
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,279
No.

161
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,920
I want to know everything about him.

162
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:07,839
Yes.

163
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,360
Commander.

164
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,720
Zhaoxue?

165
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,839
Why are you here?

166
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Huaizhou.

167
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,639
I made soup

168
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,680
and brought you a bowl.

169
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,039
Why did you think

170
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,399
of bringing me soup?

171
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,720
Thank you
for saving Jingzhou last night.

172
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,759
Fortunately,

173
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,279
you shot in time yesterday.

174
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,159
Otherwise,

175
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,790
Jingzhou would have been in danger.

176
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,080
Jingzhou is my brother.

177
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,679
We're a family.

178
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
He was in danger.

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
It's only right that I help him.

180
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,320
Then who do you think

181
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,200
is the culprit behind this incident?

182
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,320
How dare they

183
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,840
send an assassin

184
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,639
to Gu Manor to assassinate Jingzhou?

185
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,720
Zhaoxue.

186
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,240
With Jingzhou

187
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
and me here,

188
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,320
you don't need to worry.

189
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,120
How could I not worry?

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
The murderer
acted so rampantly this time.

191
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,480
He must be
from some powerful organization.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're right.

193
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,480
This time,

194
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
the opponent came on strong.

195
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,519
We mustn't underestimate them.

196
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,759
They're probably not an ordinary enemy.

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,279
Could the Gu family

198
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
have offended someone before?

199
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,799
This assassination

200
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,399
targeted Jingzhou alone.

201
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,000
I think

202
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,120
it's probably General Zheng's confidant

203
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,559
seeking revenge.

204
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,159
General Zheng's confidant?

205
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,720
What do we do?

206
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,679
Zhaoxue.

207
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,039
Zhaoxue.

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,879
Don't worry.

209
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,360
I've arranged for Mr. Chen

210
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,000
to deploy men around the manor
to protect us.

211
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,879
Thank you.

212
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,320
I'll go first.

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Wait.

214
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,559
Is there something else?

215
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,360
Zhaoxue.

216
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,639
Thank you for your soup.

217
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,399
Dr. Lu.

218
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,399
Is Dr. Lu here?

219
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,919
Coming.

220
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,000
Mr. Chen.

221
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,559
Why are you here?

222
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,360
Mr. Gu's old stomachache problem
has come back recently.

223
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,710
He asked me to get some medicine.

224
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,590
It's just a small matter.
Just give me a call

225
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,060
and I'll have someone send it to you.

226
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,480
Why bother to come here in person?

227
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,600
I happened to pass by
and stopped by to get it.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,860
Give me a moment then.

229
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,650
I'll get it for you.

230
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,840
Take this twice a day

231
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,600
after meals.

232
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,240
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

233
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,279
I'll leave first.

234
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,879
Take care.

235
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,279
Jingzhou.

236
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,279
You're back.

237
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,080
Are you tired?

238
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,039
I'm fine.

239
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,200
Nothing

240
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,519
happened today, right?

241
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,720
Here.

242
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,279
Give it to me.

243
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,440
Do you know that the hardest thing
for me every day

244
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,000
is waiting for you to come home?

245
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,080
Did you miss me?

246
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,159
I was worried about your safety.

247
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,279
Jingzhou.

248
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,440
To be safe, you should bring
two more people with you

249
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,039
starting tomorrow to prevent any danger
from happening again.

250
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,000
Alright.

251
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,279
I'm fine.

252
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,159
Don't worry.

253
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,159
Who do you think

254
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,080
is trying to assassinate you?

255
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,080
I have no idea either.

256
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,519
But something must be wrong with Li Qifa.

257
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,320
Could it be General Zheng's confidant
who came back

258
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,320
for revenge?

259
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,480
I don't think so.

260
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,620
He has been disregarding human lives
and withholding military pay

261
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,600
over the years.

262
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
No one

263
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,960
will avenge him.

264
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,360
Who could it be?

265
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:45,879
Don't worry

266
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,320
about anything.

267
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,960
Stay at home.

268
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,120
Don't go out.

269
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,639
If you need anything,

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,110
get the servants to buy it.

271
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,639
But you're the one
I worry about the most.

272
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
You're busy with work.

273
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,990
The places you frequent daily
are a mixed bag of good and bad people.

274
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,360
If anything happens to you,

275
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,799
I...

276
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,519
Stop worrying.

277
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,600
I will protect myself

278
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,159
and my wife.

279
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,759
Hello?

280
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,519
Commander Gu.

281
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:29,799
Lu.

282
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,080
Mr. Chen dropped by just now.

283
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,919
He said he came to get
some stomach medicine for your brother.

284
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,420
While I was getting the medicine,

285
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,990
he injected potassium chloride
into Li Qifa's medicine bottle.

286
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,120
Are you sure?

287
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,450
There shouldn't be any mistake.

288
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,360
No one else
has been to the clinic today.

289
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:42,960
Okay.

290
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,080
Got it.

291
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,320
What happened?

292
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,120
Mr. Chen

293
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,840
injected potassium chloride
into Li Qifa's medicine bottle.

294
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,240
He's trying to kill him.

295
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,799
It must be Gu Huaizhou.

296
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,480
Why do you think it's him?

297
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,399
I brought soup to Gu Huaizhou today

298
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,039
to thank him for saving you.

299
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,919
I tried to gauge his intentions.

300
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,840
He said

301
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,759
it could be General Zheng's confidant
back for revenge.

302
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,180
He's clearly trying
to disrupt our train of thought.

303
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm too naive after all.

304
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,320
How could a wolf not be a predator?

305
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,919
Jingzhou.

306
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,919
