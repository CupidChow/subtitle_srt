Good thing we removed the birthmark
on your back in advance.

Otherwise,
all our efforts will be in vain.

Are you going to tell him
the truth in the future?

Ms. Lin.

18
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,200
Could you please persuade our commander?

19
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,639
Why didn't you stop him?

20
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
I tried to stop him, but I failed.

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,599

Ms. Fu has passed away
for so many years.

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,759

your wealth and glory in Gu Manor,

why come and see me?

all of the Gu family's fortune,

Miss.

188
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,720
Your luggage.

189
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,240
Leave them there.

190
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,440
Mr. Chen.

191
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,480
Lead him
to take Ms. Zheng's luggage to her room.

192
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes.

193
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,480
This way.

194
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,000
Qianyu.

195
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,120
What's wrong?

196
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,519
I'm fine.

197
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,279
The chili stung my eyes.

198
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,480
The pattern on that man's pant legs
is so unique.

199
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,639
Is it custom made?

200
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,600
That one?

201
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,120
That's the symbol of my father's guards.

202
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,840
It means

203
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,039
eternal loyalty.

204
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,480
My father sent him to protect me.

205
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,159
Your father loves you very much.

206
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,080
Of course.

207
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,650
I'm his only daughter.

208
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,520
If he doesn't love me,
who else would he love?

209
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:15,879
Jingzhou.

210
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,200
You must also treat Ms. Zheng well.

211
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,559
Yes.

212
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,519
I'll have to learn from you and Qianyu.

213
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,399
