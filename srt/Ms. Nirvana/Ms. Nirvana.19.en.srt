=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 19=

4
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,239
Mr. Zheng.

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,280
When did you get back?

6
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,480
If I don't come back,

7
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,840
I'm afraid Hu City

8
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,319
will be turned upside down.

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,560
Did you receive my telegram?

10
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,879
Why didn't you kill Fu Zhaoxue then?

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
I didn't expect

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,239
that Gu Jingzhou already knew

14
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,719
that Lin Qianyu was Fu Zhaoxue.

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,879
He kept staying at home.

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,760
I didn't have the chance to do anything.

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,799
I'm afraid

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,040
this matter
isn't as simple as you said.

19
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,439
Your father

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,319
begged me to wipe out the Fu family

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,740
to keep
the Gu family's shipping business.

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,000
I remember

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,159
that you two brothers liked Fu Zhaoxue,

24
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,079
but your father

25
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,879
still made this decision.

26
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,640
You're no match for your father!

27
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,319
Mr. Zheng, you're right.

28
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,200
And your brother

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,879
came to me

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,790
after falling out with your father.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,680
I took him in without hesitation.

32
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm gave him

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,919
everything he has today.

34
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,360
My daughter is so nice to him.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,560
I can't believe he couldn't forget

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,719
Fu Zhaoxue!

37
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,800
Who does the Gu family

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
think they are?

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,560
Mr. Zheng.

40
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,080
It's my fault.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,879
I've arranged

42
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,840
for a massive search for them.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,879
Mr. Zheng.

44
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,120
You also know

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,120
that Yuzhen is deeply in love
with Gu Jingzhou.

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
Given Yuzhen's personality,

47
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,719
your extensive search

48
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,479
will alert them.

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,439
With my troops in Hu City,

50
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
I can turn Hu City upside down.

51
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm not afraid
of not being able to find them.

52
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,520
Yes.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,319
Mr. Zheng.

54
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,439
Gu Jingzhou
is highly respected in the army.

55
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,520
He might have some confidants.

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,240
Your high-profile search for Gu Jingzhou

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,439
would cause internal conflict.

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,840
Why not

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,159
let me handle this?

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,080
Give me some time.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,240
I'll bring Gu Jingzhou and Fu Zhaoxue

62
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,599
to you.

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,919
Father.

64
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,280
Please ensure

65
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,960
that Jingzhou wakes up soon.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
(Memorial Tablet of Gu Zhaoren)

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,680
I can't lose him.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,240
Jingzhou.

69
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,639
You're awake.

70
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,719
Mr. Fu.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
(Memorial Tablet of Gu Zhaoren)
I did you

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
and the Fu family wrong.

73
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,600
Jingzhou.

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,079
You're still injured.

75
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,040
Get up first.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on.

77
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,720
Xue.

78
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,279
Hiding here isn't a long-term solution.

79
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,959
I'll have Ding escort you out of here.

80
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,480
You got hurt because of me.

81
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,079
How could I leave you here alone?

82
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,720
I've lost all my family.

83
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
I can't lose you too.

84
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,720
Don't worry.

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,759
Everything will be alright.

86
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,680
Commander.

87
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,639
You're awake.

88
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,600
General Zheng has arrived in Hu City.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,970
There's no time to delay.

90
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,880
I'll arrange for our comrades
to escort you away as soon as possible.

91
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,439
Thank you.

92
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,660
(Two Days Later)

93
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,560
Xue.

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,399
Xue.

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,360
Xue!

96
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,279
Commander.

97
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,519
How was it?

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,639
Is it serious?

99
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,920
It's not a big deal.

100
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,800
His wounds just opened up a little.

101
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,759
Those killers earlier

102
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,959
are definitely not from the army.

103
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,720
Gu Huaizhou probably sent them.

104
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,000
He figured out

105
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
that we're still in the clinic.

106
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,480
And the killers

107
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,759
never returned.

108
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
They'll be more certain

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,279
that you two are here,

110
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,480
so you

111
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,399
can't stay much longer.

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,800
Dr. Lu.

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Tell your comrades not to pick us up.

114
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,480
General Zheng
must have locked down the city.

115
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
We can't get out.

116
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay.

117
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,680
I'll inform them right away.

118
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,040
Commander.

119
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,879
I'll go back to Commander's Department
and gather all the men we can trust.

120
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,490
We'll send you out of the city,

121
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,839
even if it takes our lives.

122
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,480
No.

123
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,959
It's too risky.

124
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,079
I don't want to trade
the soldiers' lives for mine.

125
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,120
Jingzhou.

126
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,720
Sorry.

127
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,720
This is all because of me.

128
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
God has already given me
the greatest blessing

129
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,320
by letting you come back to me.

130
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,679
Even if I die now,

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,879
I have no regrets.

132
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,519
Tell me.

133
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,519
I owe you so much.

134
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,360
How can I repay you?

135
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,559
I just want you to be alive.

136
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,759
Mr. Gu.

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,279
None of the four killers we sent

138
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
came back.

139
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,159
I knew it.

140
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,519
They're at Lu's Clinic.

141
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,480
Mr. Gu.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,279
Shall we inform General Zheng

143
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,320
about this?

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,600
I already promised General Zheng
to find them.

145
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,639
General Zheng won't spare me

146
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,960
if I tell him now.

147
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Then,

148
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,279
what do we do now?

149
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,559
Mr. Gu.

150
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,559
You asked to see me?

151
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,559
Adjutant Cai.

152
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,600
I've found Gu Jingzhou and Fu Zhaoxue's

153
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,559
hiding place.

154
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
We must tell General immediately.

155
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
But we don't have enough men.

156
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,399
Besides,

157
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,519
I promised General

158
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,960
to bring them both to him.

159
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,879
If we bother General now,

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,639
I will lose face.

161
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,279
How about this?

162
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,000
Adjutant Cai.

163
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,879
Let's work together.

164
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,879
Once this matter is settles,

165
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,440
the credit is yours.

166
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,320
Well...

167
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,159
You don't want the credit?

168
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,679
But I have two conditions.

169
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Fu Zhaoxue

170
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,159
is mine.

171
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,039
Gu Jingzhou

172
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,279
must die.

173
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,799
If we kill Gu Jingzhou,

174
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,840
it'll be difficult to explain it

175
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,519
to Ms. Zheng and General.

176
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,080
You don't have

177
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,799
to kill Gu Jingzhou.

178
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,360
Just give this

179
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,039
to General.

180
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,279
Don't worry

181
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
about the rest.

182
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,639
Gu Huaizhou.

183
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,720
What are you doing here?

184
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,360
Ms. Zheng.

185
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm here to see Mr. Zheng.

186
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,440
Unfortunately,

187
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,240
he's busy.

188
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,799
Ms. Zheng.

189
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,639
Adjutant Cai.

190
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,679
I'll take my leave first.

191
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,840
Wait.

192
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,560
What are you holding in your hand?

193
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Let me have a look.

194
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Ms. Zheng.

195
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,330
This is General's confidential document.

196
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,990
(Gu Jingzhou
intercepted the smuggling ships)

197
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,679
(and framed Zhao Zhong.)

198
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,159
Give it to Father.

199
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,120
Yes.

200
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,960
Gu Jingzhou is mine.

201
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,080
Only I can kill him.

202
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,720
Mr. Gu.

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,039
Adjutant Cai is dead.

204
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
When did it happen?

205
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,120
Right after you met him.

206
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,480
They said he offended Ms. Zheng

207
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
and was executed.

208
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,799
That lunatic.

209
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,159
Does think she can protect Gu Jingzhou

210
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,639
by intercepting the evidence?

211
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,399
