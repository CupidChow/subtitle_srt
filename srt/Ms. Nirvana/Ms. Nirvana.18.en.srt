00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,560

99

Yes.

102
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:47,960
Yes!

103
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,600
Stop!

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,990
What are you trying to do?

105
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,360
You must be Lu Heng.

106
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,120
Yes.

What can I do for you?

108
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,960

109

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,080

00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,960

113
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,159

114
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,039

115
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,879

117
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,399
Calm down.

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,039
No one can stop me today.

119
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,679
I must find Jingzhou

120
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,600
and kill Fu Zhaoxue.

121
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,320
Report!

122
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,399
Miss.

123
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,480
We've searched everywhere.

124
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,490
We didn't see Commander.

125
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,159
Tell me

126
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,320
where is Gu Jingzhou.

127
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,679
Ms. Zheng.

128
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,440
Calm down.

129
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,279
Dr. Lu.

130
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,080
Sorry.

131
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,120
Let me handle this.

132
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,490
You can go back and rest first.

133
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,559
Ms. Zheng.

134
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,159
You're so worried
about Gu Jingzhou's safety.

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
What about him?

136
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,200
What do you mean?

137
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,840
My men found out

138
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,279
that Gu Jingzhou was responsible

139
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,720
for the robbery
of General's opium and firearms.

140
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,240
Nonsense.

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,679
Gu Jingzhou
would never betray my father.

142
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,360
Nothing in the world is absolute.

143
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,840
If he did betray General,

144
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,240
what can you do?

145
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,399
I'll kill him then.

146
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,759
Okay.

147
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,840
You're resolute.

148
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,399
I hope

149
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,240
you'll remember what you said today.

150
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,440
I remember.

151
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,840
What about Fu Zhaoxue?

152
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,440
I'll kill her,

153
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,639
but not now.

154
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,639
Your men have searched the place.

155
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,399
Gu Jingzhou isn't here.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,190
It's a waste of effort for you

157
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,840
to keep this up.

158
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,240
In my opinion,

159
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,600
we just
need to wait and see what happens.

160
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,919
Gu Jingzhou was seriously wounded.

161
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,480
He can't escape.

162
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
You're patient.

163
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,120
Ms. Zheng.

164
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,519
That's all I have to say.

165
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,360
It's up to you

166
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,360
whether you leave.

167
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,240
Let's go!

168
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,000
Mr. Gu.

169
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,840
Why did you stop Ms. Zheng
from searching the clinic today?

170
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,159
I think

171
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,490
since Commander has been shot,

172
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,080
there's no way they can transfer him
in their current condition.

173
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,039
If Zheng Yuzhen finds them first,

174
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,919
she would kill Zhaoxue

175
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,440
given her personality.

176
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,960
So we have to get ahead of her

177
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,799
and tell her where Gu Jingzhou is.

178
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,039
Given General Zheng's personality,

179
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,759
he won't spare Gu Jingzhou easily.

180
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,360
Now,

181
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,670
send someone
to the clinic to investigate

182
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,080
and see
if there are any other new clues.

183
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:12,879
Yes.

184
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,039
Hello?

185
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,159
Hello? Father.

186
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,080
Hurry over to Hu City.

187
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,320
What happened?

188
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,879
We failed.

189
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,679
Gu Jingzhou was shot.

190
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,799
I don't know if he's alive.

191
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,519
Even Fu Zhaoxue has disappeared.

192
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,519
Father, hurry up.

193
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,159
Help me capture Gu Jingzhou.

194
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,100
(Lu's Clinic)

195
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:04,879
Jingzhou.

196
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,759
Wake up.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,919
Do you know how worried I am about you?

198
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Please don't let anything happen to you.

199
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,960
Jingzhou.

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,039
Jingzhou.

201
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,480
Lu Heng!

202
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,200
Lu Heng!

203
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,279
Lu Heng.

204
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,159
He moved.

205
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,720
He moved just now.

206
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,340
His fever has subsided.

207
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,840
He has made it through.

208
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,559
Then why hasn't he woken up yet?

209
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,540
The surgery was performed
under general anesthesia.

210
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,790
The drug effect hasn't worn off yet.

211
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,279
What do we do next?

212
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,840
I must personally

213
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,159
avenge the Fu family.

214
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,320
What about him?

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,180
Have you thought it through?

216
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,679
He and the Gu family are separate entities.

217
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,919
He approached General Zheng all these years

218
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,679
just to avenge the Fu family.

219
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,540
But he's a member
of the Gu family after all.

220
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,759
There's a blood feud between you two.

221
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,790
How can you go back
to the way things were?

222
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,440
Dr. Lu.

223
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,480
It's better to tear down ten temples
than destroy a couple.

224
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,559
Commander even gave you
the guards' list.

225
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,039
The guards' list?

226
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,039
It was him?

227
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,159
What do you think?

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,480
It will take you
a long time to find it yourself.

229
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,790
That's why Commander
asked me to find a way

230
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,250
to find someone to give you the list.

231
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,799
Commander has endured humiliation
for Ms. Fu and the Fu family

232
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,039
over the years,

233
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,279
even at the cost of his life.

234
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,039
General Zheng's guards

235
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,679
killed my father

236
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,639
and injured Jingzhou.

237
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,480
I

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,039
must get revenge.

239
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,780
I'm here to collect the trash.

240
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,980
(Lu's Clinic)

241
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,559
Mr. Chen.

242
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,200
Look.

243
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
They used so much gauze

244
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,480
and antibiotics.

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,960
They shed so much blood.

246
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,360
The person lying inside

247
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,480
are either shot

248
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,759
or seriously injured.

249
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,279
Thank you.

250
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,970
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

251
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,240
Mr. Gu.

252
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,759
Based on the current evidence,

253
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,799
Commander and Mrs. Gu
must be in the clinic.

254
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,679
Ms. Zheng led a large-scale search

255
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,799
but didn't find them.

256
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,600
There must be
a secret room in the clinic.

257
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,460
Get some guys to raid the clinic

258
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,399
with weapons at night.

259
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,279
Find them,

260
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,159
no matter what it takes.
