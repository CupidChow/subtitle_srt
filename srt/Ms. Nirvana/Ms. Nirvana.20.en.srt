2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 20=

4
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,359
Mr. Gu.

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,159
You came.

6
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,879
Dr. Lu.

7
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,550
You've worked hard
to take care of the Gu family

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,239
over the years.

9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,680
You didn't come here today

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
just to thank me, did you?

11
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,599
I didn't expect

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,879
that not only are you a skilled doctor,

13
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,760
you're also good at keeping secrets.

14
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,650
Mr. Gu, what are you talking about?

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,159
I

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,439
don't understand.

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,480
I know you won't admit it.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,000
I

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,799
want you to pass a message

20
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,760
to my wife and Gu Jingzhou.

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,519
General Zheng
has locked down the entire Hu City.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,359
They can't get out.

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
Only I

24
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,799
can send them out
with the shipping route.

25
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,879
I know you won't believe me,

26
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,799
but this is your only way out.

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,879
I'm only helping you

28
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,120
because Zhaoxue is my wife.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
Even if she doesn't love me,

30
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,919
she's still the one I love the most.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
I don't want her to die.

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,599
Dr. Lu.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,599
Please.

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
Gu Huaizhou was here just now.

35
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,790
He said he can get you out of Hu City

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
with his shipping route.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,919
He's really doing everything he can.

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,990
He even started
playing the emotional card.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,199
Did he also say

40
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,110
Xue is the person he loves the most.

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,319
You know him well.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,479
He's probably why General Zheng

43
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,039
hasn't surrounded this place.

44
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,280
Before he sees you two,

45
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,879
it's still safe here.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,120
Jingzhou.

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Do you remember?

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
You

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,719
used to always bring me here
to enjoy the night scene.

50
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,639
How could I forget?

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,159
Back then, I always thought

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,680
one

53
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,080
of these lights

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,199
will be ours

55
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,199
someday.

56
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,439
I had already
thought about it back then.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,599
Once we get married,

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,639
I will plant your favorite flowers
in the garden

59
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,280
and pick a bunch of flowers and put them
on your pillow every morning.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,439
When it's sunny,

61
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,039
we'll sit by the window and play chess.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,759
When it rains,

63
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,800
we'll take a nap on the couch.

64
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,960
We will have many children.

65
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,959
I thought

66
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,680
it will happen soon,

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,879
but I didn't expect...

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
We don't even have a home anymore.

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,990
What nonsense are you talking about?

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,590
What do you mean
by not having a home anymore?

71
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,720
My home

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,839
is wherever you are.

73
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,480
If I hadn't

74
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,399
sent you back that day...

75
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,439
Even

76
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,439
if I stayed in Gu Manor that day,

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,680
the Fu family will still be wiped out.

78
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,839
The Fu family was murdered

79
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,639
by the Gu family and the Zheng family.

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,879
Jingzhou.

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
It has nothing to do with you.

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,759
Were you ever afraid?

83
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,720
I

84
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,720
was very scared that day.

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
I wished it was a nightmare.

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,319
I

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
kept calling your name in the dream,

88
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,000
but I can't wake up

89
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,920
no matter how much I shout.

90
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,959
But reality is still reality.

91
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,199
Since I decided
to marry into the Gu family,

92
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,360
I have nothing to fear.

93
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,879
I secretly swore

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,439
that I would personally kill

95
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
everyone involved
in the Fu family's massacre.

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
Five years have passed.

97
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,519
My Xue

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,959
has changed,

99
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
but I can't imagine

100
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,660
what you've been through

101
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,720
these past five years.

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Aren't you the same?

103
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,100
Over the past five years,

104
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,639
you've endure humiliation

105
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,040
and walked on eggshells

106
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,959
at General Zheng's side

107
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,639
for me

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,199
and the Fu family.

109
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,560
You

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,519
also have to deal with Zheng Yuzhen
who covets you.

111
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,839
Jingzhou.

112
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,160
Have you ever regretted it?

113
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Regret

114
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,680
knowing me.

115
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Regret

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,800
getting revenge for me.

117
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,519
Regret

118
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,120
giving up your bright future

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
to accompany me on a doomed path.

120
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,240
What are you talking about?

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,800
What doomed path?

122
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,680
I have no plans to die.

123
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm waiting to get your revenge

124
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,920
and propose to you under the stars.

125
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,279
Xue.

126
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,519
You're the best thing

127
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,000
that ever happened to me.

128
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,000
No matter what lies in the future,

129
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720
I won't regret it.

130
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,399
As long as I can be with you,

131
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,680
even if it's an abyss right up ahead,

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,040
I'll jump without any regrets.

133
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,240
As long as I can be with you,

134
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,680
even if it's an abyss right up ahead,

135
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,279
I'll jump

136
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,600
without any regrets.

You must agree to it.

150

162

So

163

can't solve this problem alone.

167
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,639
I can't watch him die alone.

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,879
He has done enough for me.

169
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,519
I want to personally

170

Even if I die,

172
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,360
I want to die with him.

173
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,279
Qianyu.

174
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,399
You came back.

175
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,320
Gu Huaizhou.

176
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,879
There's no need
for us to continue acting.

177
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,120
Qianyu?

178
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,950
I've been missing you these days.

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,120
Let's make a deal.

180
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,039
You know what I want.

181
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
I also have a condition.

182
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,639
Spare Gu Jingzhou?

183
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,440
No.

184
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,720
I want you to invite Zheng Yuzhen.

185
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,639
I want to kill her.

186
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,440
This joke has gone too far.

187
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,919
Once Zheng Yuzhen dies,

188
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,039
none of us will survive.

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,399
Gu Jingzhou is already on his way
to Commander's Department.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
He has agreed to marry Zheng Yuzhen

191
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,519
to protect me.

192
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,460
(Hu City's City Defense Department)

193
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,559
How bold of you

194
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
to point guns at Commander?

195
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,080
Where's General?

196
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,879
Even if I'm willing,

197
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,039
will Gu Jingzhou spare me
once Zheng Yuzhen dies?

198
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,799
If Zheng Yuzhen dies,

199
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,279
General Zheng
will never spare Gu Jingzhou.

200
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,559
When that happens,

201
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,360
I'll run away with you.

202
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,840
Your words

203
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,679
made me gasp in shock

204
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,120
and shudder.

205
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I didn't expect a weak woman like you

206
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,759
to be so cunning

207
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,639
and meticulous.

208
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,879
Given time,

209
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,399
you might also kill me at some point.

210
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
The real Fu Zhaoxue

211
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,279
has died five years ago.

212
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,039
Now,

213
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,240
I'm just a tool for her to get revenge.

214
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,399
I just need to complete
her revenge plan.

215
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,960
I don't care

216
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,039
about myself.

217
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,519
Okay.

218
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,159
I promise you.

219
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:11,639
General.

220
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm here.

221
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,240
You're bold

222
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,159
to come to me yourself.

223
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,240
I promise to marry Zheng Yuzhen,

224
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
but on one condition.

225
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,480
Who are you to make a deal with me

226
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,399
in your current condition?

227
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,519
Since I'm here,

228
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,399
I'm well-prepared.

229
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,240
When you have no way out,

230
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,759
you have to face it.

231
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,799
This is what you taught me.

232
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,759
I remember

233
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,559
I also taught you

234
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,340
a person who achieves great things

235
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,080
can't be swayed by sentiment.

236
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,399
I'll give you another chance

237
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,080
for your father's sake.

238
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,039
Kill Fu Zhaoxue.

239
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll pretend

240
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,679
none of this ever happened.

241
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,360
What big gift

242
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,120
did you require me to come here myself?

243
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,000
Come out.

244
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,600
Lin Qianyu?

245
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,679
Gu Huaizhou.

246
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,240
What are you waiting for?

247
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,600
You promised me.

248
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,320
What are you doing?

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Gu Huaizhou.

250
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
You want to kill me?

251
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,759
Think it through.

252
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,840
If I die,

253
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,240
none of you can survive.
