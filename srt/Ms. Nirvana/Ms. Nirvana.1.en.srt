00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 1=

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,680
Escaping after you wake up?

5
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,150
What are you trying to do?

6
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,959
You're marrying

7
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,519
the richest man in Hu City tomorrow.

8
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,120
I'll give you a gift.

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,519
Qianyu.

10
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,879
Do you like them?

11
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,280
Gu Jingzhou.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,879
You're shameless.

13
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,079
What are you doing?

14
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,719
Let me go.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let me go!

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
If I remember correctly,

17
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,519
you haven't seen me before.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,400
You're an unmarried young woman,

19
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,630
who have been living
in the countryside all these years.

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,800
How could you recognize me?

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,080
You're popular
in the three provinces of Jianghuai.

22
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,599
Your photos often appear in newspapers.

23
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,960
Recognizing you

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,000
shouldn't be strange.

25
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,599
You know the Gu family very well.

26
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,719
It's not
just to marry Gu Huaizhou, right?

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,240
Speak.

28
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,960
What other purpose do you have?

29
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
I'm marrying your elder brother
because of Old Master Gu's last wish.

30
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,520
I'm just a woman.

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
What choice do I have?

32
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,599
Why not

33
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,639
make today's incident a reality?

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
How about we have some fun?

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,039
Gu Jingzhou.

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,560
If you do this, aren't you afraid
that your reputation will be affected?

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,759
What do I have to fear?

38
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,840
The entire Hu City is mine.

39
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,039
Okay.

40
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,960
Since you want it,

41
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,120
I'll satisfy you.

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,400
(I, Fu Zhaoxue,)

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,199
(was Gu Jingzhou's fiancée,)

44
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,990
(but the Gu family
disregarded our relationship)

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,719
(and ordered Lin Fan
to wipe out the Fu family.)

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,560
(Gu Jingzhou.)

47
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,039
(Today, I'll use Lin Qianyu's face)

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,639
(to become your sister-in-law)

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,960
(and get back what I lost)

50
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,159
(one by one.)

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
(Gu Huaizhou.)

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,879
(Are you ready
to face the consequences?)

53
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,840
Everyone.

54
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,159
I, Huaizhou, am marrying

55
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,719
the Lin family's daughter

56
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,639
as per my father's last wish.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,630
Because my father has just passed away,

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
the wedding is kept simple.

59
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,599
Everyone here is prominent in Hu City.

60
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,719
It's a great honor

61
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,879
to have you all here.

62
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,199
I hope you will forgive me

63
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,439
if I didn't provide you
sufficient attention.

64
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,600
What's going on?

65
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,360
Why is Mr. Jingzhou here?

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Mr. Jingzhou is here.

67
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,519
Jingzhou.

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,319
You didn't come back when Father died.

69
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,959
I know you and General Zheng
were fighting on the front lines,

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,760
busy protecting
the country and the people.

71
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,040
That's why

72
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,839
I didn't send you an invitation.

73
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,839
Everyone.

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,439
General Zheng ordered me to return to Hu City
and serve as City Defense Commander.

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,759
It's

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,120
my brother's big day today.

77
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,730
Although I didn't receive an invitation,

78
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,759
how can I

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,480
not congratulate my brother

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,639
on his wedding?

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
I've long heard that you're remarkable,

82
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,040
it's indeed true

83
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,759
after seeing you today.

84
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,519
But the injury on your face...

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,959
A shrew scratched me.

86
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,639
I went out drinking yesterday.

87
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,199
A shrew appeared out of nowhere

88
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,399
and accidentally scratched me.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,720
It's not serious.

90
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,160
Thank you for your concern.

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,120
It's your wedding day today.

92
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
It's a small gift,

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
but it carries my appreciation.

94
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,639
Why don't you check it out?

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,880
(My Love, Fu Zhaoxue's Memorial Tablet)

96
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,540
(Fu Zhaoxue)

97
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,240
Gu Jingzhou, what are you trying to do?

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,959
Five years ago,

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,959
Lin Fan, the manager of Gu Firm,

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,879
secretly used the Gu family's
shipping line for smuggling.

101
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,040
It caused huge losses
to the Gu family's shipping business.

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
They even wiped out the Fu family.

103
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
My fiancée, Fu Zhaoxue,

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,279
died tragically because of this.

105
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,399
Gu Jingzhou, shut up!

106
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,240
My fiancée's death

107
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,560
was caused by the Lin family.

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,240
(Does he still have feelings
for Fu Zhaoxue?)

109
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
The Lin family's daughter
joined the Gu family.

110
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm here today to seek justice.

111
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,600
What do you want?

112
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,660
(My Love, Fu Zhaoxue's Memorial Tablet)

113
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,480
It's only natural that a life

114
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,480
should be paid with a life.

115
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Nonsense!

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,860
Even if you are appointed
City Defense Commander,

117
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm not scared of you.

118
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,399
Are you going to kill your sister-in-law
in front of all the wealthy gentry?

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,839
Huaizhou, don't be nervous.

120
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,920
I just want to play a game.

121
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
I have three bullets in this gun.

122
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,720
Qianyu just needs to shoot herself
in the head.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
Her life and death is up to fate.

124
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,240
Jingzhou.

125
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,930
The murderer who killed the Fu family
has been brought to justice.

126
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
There's no need
to sacrifice another life.

127
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,040
Looks like you care a lot about Qianyu.

128
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,720
Alright.

129
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,639
I'll give you another choice.

130
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,199
I want
the Gu family's shipping business.

131
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
(I'm overthinking.)

132
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,439
(Turns out that's his real purpose.)

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,319
No way.

134
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,000
The inheritance left to you
in Father's will

135
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,439
doesn't include the shipping business.

136
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:05,879
Jingzhou.

137
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,240
It's my wedding today.

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,839
Anything can wait

139
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,519
until after the wedding.

140
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,990
We can sit down and discuss it slowly.

141
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,079
That means you disagree.

142
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,560
Okay.

143
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,000
Qianyu will have to suffer then.

144
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,590
Have you lost your mind?

145
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,560
I'll play with you.

146
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,679
I prefer to take the initiative.

147
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
Let me serve you.

148
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:47,600
No!

149
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,240
No!

150
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,919
I thought you were good,

151
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,120
but you're not.

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,200
What on earth are you trying to do?

153
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,559
At tomorrow's wedding,

154
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,879
no matter what I want to do,

155
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,679
just obey me and follow my instructions.

156
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,559
Otherwise,

157
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,399
these photos
and everything that happened today

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
will make the headlines.

159
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,639
Got it?

160
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
In that case,

161
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,679
you need to be more careful.

162
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,080
(She would really shoot herself.)

163
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,799
(Why is she so bold?)

164
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,799
Jingzhou.

165
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,080
God has made his choice.

166
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,799
You should be satisfied now.

167
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,200
Don't worry.

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,720
I won't take away

169
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,559
a single cent of your share

170
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,360
of the inheritance in Father's will.

171
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
After the wedding,

172
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,080
we can sit down and talk slowly.

173
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,440
I'll give you

174
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,120
more.

175
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,679
Okay.

176
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,039
Remember your words.

177
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,559
Since you and Qianyu

178
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,960
are a loving couple,

179
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,679
I'll keep my word.

180
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,639
The wedding may continue!

181
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,519
The bride dared to shoot herself.

182
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,399
She's indeed the daughter of a murderer.

183
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,320
Turns out Gu Jingzhou came back
to seize the family fortune.

184
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,960
The Gu family is in for a ride.

185
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,120
Jingzhou.

186
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,540
This is the bridal chamber
for me and your brother.

187
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,879
Are you in the wrong room?

188
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,799
How dare you ruin my plan?

189
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,039
Aren't you afraid
that I will make your photos public?

190
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,639
Making those photos public
won't do you any good.

191
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,480
You want to seize
the Gu family's fortune.

192
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,080
And I'm

193
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
your best helper.

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
You're overestimating yourself.

195
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,320
Without you,

196
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,120
I can still get what I want.

197
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,399
Besides,

198
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,039
you're not very obedient.

199
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,600
There's no way that Gu Huaizhou will hand
the shipping business over to you.

200
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,900
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to me.

201
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,679
Right?

202
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,639
How can you be of use to me

203
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,600
when you're so out of control?

204
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,879
I did that

205
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,559
just to gain Gu Huaizhou's trust.

206
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,600
What are you after?

207
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,440
I want the Gu family's fortune just like you.

208
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,480
Be a good wife

209
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,000
and the Gu family's fortune

210
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,320
will be yours.

211
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,799
What's the fun in being a rich wife?

212
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,759
You're only free when you're wealthy.

213
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,919
You're indeed Lin Fan's daughter.

214
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,639
Compared to your father,

215
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
you're more greedy.

216
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,960
Don't forget.

217
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,600
My father took the blame
for the Gu family.

218
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,519
How about it?

219
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
After everything's settled,

220
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,080
you can take the shipping business,
and the rest is mine.

221
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,639
You're just a pawn.

222
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,200
Who are you to negotiate terms with me?

223
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,360
Why aren't you leaving yet?

224
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,039
Are you scared?

225
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,519
If your brother finds out,

226
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,000
it won't be good for us.

227
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,120
Don't you like exciting things?

228
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,919
How could we waste such an opportunity?

229
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:17,759
Kiss me.

230
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,480
Qianyu.

231
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,480
Kiss me.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,850
Qianyu, open the door.

233
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,320
Huaizhou.

234
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,080
Give me a minute.

235
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm taking a bath.
