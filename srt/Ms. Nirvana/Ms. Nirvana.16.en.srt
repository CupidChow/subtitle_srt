4
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,599
Huaizhou.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,640
Careful.

6
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,640
What are you doing?

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,239
Qianyu.

8
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,640
I just had some drinks with Huaizhou.

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,159
Who knew Huaizhou
couldn't handle alcohol and got drunk?

10
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,719
Don't wait up.

11
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,079
Huaizhou can't sleep with you tonight.

12
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,879
I'll take him to the study to rest.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,799
Hurry back.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Huaizhou, hold on for a while.

15
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,319
Why did you drink so much?

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
I drank so much.

17
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,280
How many times do I have to tell you?

18
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,960
Why do you keep sabotaging my plans?

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,319
I...

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,639
I just don't want you to hurt yourself.

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,039
I told you

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,639
Gu Huaizhou and I are married.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,319
I can only get his fortune

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,479
by gaining his trust.

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,840
Xue.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
I told you many times.

27
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,599
I'm not Fu Zhaoxue.

28
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,840
I'm Lin Qianyu,

29
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,520
Lin Fan's daughter

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
and Gu Huaizhou's wife.

31
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,480
Then why did you replace the aphrodisiac
that Zheng Yuzhen gave you

32
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,280
with sleeping drug?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
Can't I be afraid of you taking revenge?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,400
Fine.

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,319
I promise not to take revenge on you.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,639
Give me the aphrodisiac.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'll take it right now.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,039
It's just Zheng Yuzhen.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,319
I can satisfy you whatever you want.

40
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,360
Have you lost your mind?

41
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,919
I just wanted to dispel
Zheng Yuzhen's suspicion of me.

42
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,820
Whether you sleep with each other

43
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,840
has nothing to do with me.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,240
Nothing to do?

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,319
Okay.

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
I'll go to her right now.

47
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,560
Don't regret it.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,879
Xue.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,719
I already I'm not her.

50
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,719
Then why are you hugging me and crying?

51
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,680
That day at Commander's Department,

52
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,479
I pretended to be drunk.

53
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,560
I heard everything you said to me

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
when you hugged me and cried.

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,560
Xue.

56
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,959
Xue, hurry back. Xue.

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,759
I miss you so much.

58
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Please hurry back.

59
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,959
I miss you so much.

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,399
Jingzhou.

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,959
I feel so sorry

62
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,759
to see you like this.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,399
I know you've never moved on

64
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,519
because of the Fu family

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,360
all these years,

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
but you shouldn't have to bear all this.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,800
I wish all of this

68
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,240
had never happened,

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,319
But fate played us.

70
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,879
We can't go back to how things were.

71
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,600
Fu Zhaoxue

72
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,680

It's me.

90
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,360
I know you're awake.

91
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,680
If you don't open the door,

92
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
I'll come in.

93
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,600
Jingzhou.

94
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,519
Do I look good?

95
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,720
Yes.

96
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,920
It's late.

97
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,000
Why aren't you asleep yet?

98
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,199
I can't sleep.

99
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,360
Come and accompany me.

100
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,240
You...

101
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,600
Why are your eyes red?

102
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,720
Did you cry?

103
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,519
Maybe I've been too tired
from work recently

104
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,600
and haven't slept enough.

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
We aren't married yet.

106
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,839
It's inappropriate
to be touching like this.

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,500
What's wrong with that?

108
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,620
We'll have our wedding night
sooner or later anyway.

109
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,880
Why don't you talk to Father
about our wedding tomorrow?

110
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,560
Stop it.

111
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,399
General is on the front line.

112
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,680
Do you think it's inappropriate

113
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,500
to call him back for our wedding?

114
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,439
Go.

115
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,759
Go back

116
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,800
and have a good sleep.

117
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,959
I'll take you to a nice place tomorrow.

00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,360
Where are you taking me?

120
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,959

You mustn't trick me.

I'll wait for you tomorrow.

to stop hurting yourself.

138
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,080
It's nothing.

139
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,279
I've come to terms with it.

140
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,639
I know you think

141
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
it doesn't matter

142
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,519

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
The only way I'll regret it

146
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
is if I give up revenge.

147
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,350
You don't need to give it up.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,080
Leave Hu City now.

149
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,200
I'll avenge

150
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,120
the Fu family.

151
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,320
You're the one who should leave.

Gu Jingzhou.

153
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,679
Between us
are the 23 lives of the Fu family.

154
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,650
We can't go back to how things were.

155
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,639

156
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200

157
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
How dare you trick me?

158
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,000
Father.

159
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,840
I want you to kill someone for me.

160
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,200
Darling.

161
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,360
Don't you
have one of the guards with you?

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,279
No.

163
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,879
I want someone unfamiliar.

164
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,519
Which idiot

165
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
offended my darling daughter?

166
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,120
Lin Qianyu.

167
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,480
Who's that?

168
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,200
Lin Fan's daughter,

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
Lin Qianyu.

170
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,600
That wench

171
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,720
married Gu Huaizhou

172
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,320
and seduced Gu Jingzhou behind my back.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,559
Are you saying
Lin Fan's daughter married Gu Huaizhou?

174
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,720
Yeah.

175
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,440
All you do is fight in war all day long.

176
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,360
You don't even care about me.

177
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,960
She's pissing me off.

178
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,159
I don't care.

179
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,799
You must kill her.

180
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,159
I want her to die immediately.

181
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,679
How is that possible?

182
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,159
I've sent someone
to Ping City to kill her five years ago.

183
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,399
That person saw her die.

184
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,840
How could she still be alive?

185
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,879
What?

186
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,480
Something's wrong with this Lin Qianyu.

187
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,639
You should first

188
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,320
find out her true identity.

189
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,120
Why haven't I seen Ms. Li recently?

190
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,559
Where did she go?

191
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,279
I...

192
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,679
I don't know.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
You don't know?

194
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,679
No.

195
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,320
No, Ms. Zheng.

196
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,720
No.

197
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,200
Ms. Zheng.

198
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,399
No.

199
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,440
Ms. Zheng.

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,900
I'll stab you to death.

201
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,830
I'll stab you to death.

202
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,879
I'm not eating.

203
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,039
They're here.

204
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:52,759
They're here.

205
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,399
They're going to kill us.

206
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,960
Don't come over!

207
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,399
They're going to kill us.

208
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,519
We're going to die.

209
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,519
We're going to die.

210
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,600
She's crazy.

211
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,200
I can't ask anything.

212
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,159
Let's go.

213
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,500
Fu Zhaoxue!

214
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,990
Don't think your father will come back
to life if you kill me.

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,039
Go to hell.

216
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,759
Go to hell!

217
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Who did you say?

218
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,759
Fu Zhaoxue?

219
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,679
I have nothing to do with your death.

220
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,820
I have nothing to do with it.

221
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,980
I have nothing to do with it.

222
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,360
Scram.

223
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,320
Li Sitang.

224
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,399
I don't want to die.

225
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,559
Take a good look at me.

226
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,399
Who am I?

227
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,399
Zheng Yuzhen?

228
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,720
You mentioned Fu Zhaoxue.

229
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,559
What's with that?

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,720
Zheng Yuzhen.

231
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,720
That crazy woman, Fu Zhaoxue,
won't spare you.

232
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,320
You're going to die soon.

233
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,120
She won't spare you.

234
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,840
You're going to die soon.

235
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,600
You're going to die soon!

236
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,990
I'll stab you to death.

237
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,990
I'll stab you to death.

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,799
Tell me.

239
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,399
What happened?

240
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,480
From now on,

241
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,120
I'll ask you questions.

242
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
All you need to do is nod

243
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,120
or shake your head.

244
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,720
(I've sent someone)

245
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,600
(to kill Lin Qianyu five years ago.)

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,639
(Fu Zhaoxue survived)

247
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,840
(and replaced Lin Qianyu
to marry into the Gu family.)

248
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,279
(Kill her immediately)

249
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,399
(to prevent future problems.)

250
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,639
Mr. Gu.

251
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:35,879
What do we do?

252
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,879
Huaizhou.

253
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,840
Have some fruits.

254
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

255
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,679
Is there

256
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
something on my face?
