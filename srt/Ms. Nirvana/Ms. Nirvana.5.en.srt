I wear whatever I like.

The owner of the clothing store

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,319
I was envious

23
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,799
and asked him to make me one too.

24

You're not allowed
to wear a riding outfit anymore.

Hurry up.

00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,430
Lin Qianyu. How dare you have an affair
with your brother-in-law?
