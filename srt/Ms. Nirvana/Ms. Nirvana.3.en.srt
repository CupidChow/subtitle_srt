Zhaoxue!

00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,560
Zhaoxue!

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,439
Miss, it's dangerous.

8
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,319
Sitang, Madam Li, save me!

9
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,159
Let me go.

10
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,400
Zhaoxue.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
You can't be soft-hearted.

12
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,990
You must get rid
of the root of the problem.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,490
If you save her, how are you going
to explain to the Gu family?

14
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,919
Let me go.

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,560
Zhaoxue!

16
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:10,919
Miss.

17
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:11,879
Miss.

18
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,120
Besides,
Mr. Huaizhou has feelings for her.

19
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,479
If you save her,

20
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,479
how are you going to become Mrs. Gu?

21
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,240
Sitang.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
Sitang!

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
Sitang, Madam Li, save me!

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,240
Let's go.

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,840
Let's go.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,479
Let's go.

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,039
Zhaoxue.

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,599
Miss.

29
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,570
It's none of my business.

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,300
On your memorial day next year,

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll burn joss paper for you!

32
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,120
I'll burn joss paper for you!

(Li Meilan, Li Sitang)

39
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,599
Madam Li.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
You instigated Li Sitang not to save me.

41
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,159
Now,

42
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,199
(Li Meilan, Li Sitang,
Gu Jingzhou, Gu Huaizhou)

43
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm just giving you

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,479
a taste of your own medicine.

45
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,039
You're lucky

46
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,439
that I only cut off your tongue.

47
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,020
(Li Meilan, Li Sitang)

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,940
(Li Meilan)

49
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,159
Madam Li's injury

50
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,000
has been treated.

51
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,990
I asked my assistant to send her back.

52
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,159
Lu Heng.

53
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you.

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,190
You don't have to be
so polite to me all the time.

55
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,000
If Mr. Fu

56
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,439
hadn't funded me when I was little,

57
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,950
I would have been living on the streets.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,480
That's why I'm willing to do anything

59
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,879
for you and the Fu family.

60
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,160
However,

61
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,399
why didn't you
just leave Madam Li to her fate?

62
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,970
Instead, you saved her.

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
I died once

64
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,439
and I realized

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,079
that

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,639
death is the easiest.

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,399
I want Madam Li

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,639
to spend the rest of her life in anger

69
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,600
without her tongue.

70
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,040
A life worse than death

71
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,120
is the real punishment.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,240
Zhaoxue.

73
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,560
Don't call me Zhaoxue.

74
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,240
Fu Zhaoxue

75
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,480
was so stupid that she didn't see through
the Gu family's sinister hearts.

76
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,480
She doesn't deserve to live.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,990
How could you be blamed
for what happened back then?

78
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,079
Don't worry.

79
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,319
I'll help you

80
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
avenge the Fu family.

81
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,240
Who's

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
next?

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,920
(Li Meilan, Li Sitang,
Gu Jingzhou, Gu Huaizhou)

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,480
My best friend,

85
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,839
Li Sitang.

86
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,620
(Li Sitang)

87
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,959
Although Li Sitang is willful,

88
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,439
Gu Huaizhou

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,199
is closer to her

90
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,160
than to his half-brother.

91
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,200
It will probably take some effort

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
to make her suffer.

93
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,399
Don't worry.

94
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,480
As her former best friend,

95
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,360
I know how to deal with her.

96
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,120
Gu Jingzhou.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,040
No wonder

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,240
everyone calls you a mad dog.

99
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm glad that you know.

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,879
Are you going to tell the truth

101
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,439
or

102
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,800
let me kill you?

103
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,279
Kill me

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,920
if you dare.

105
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,120
Come on!

106
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,639
This batch of smuggled goods

107
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,600
is closely related to the Gu family.

108
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,990
You're calling out a thief
while being one yourself.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,199
Why pretend to be so virtuous?

110
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,519
Draw me the shipping route map.

111
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,399
The Gu family's smuggling

112
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,399
is done

113
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,879
by connecting buyers and sellers
on fixed routes.

114
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,199
I've only taken one route

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,639
all these years.

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
I don't know the rest.

117
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,800
Gu Huaizhou

118
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,720
has the complete shipping route map.

119
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,160
Commander.

120
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,590
Madam Li had her tongue cut off.

121
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,319
Did Lin Qianyu do it?

122
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,879
It's probably Li Sitang.

123
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,439
Lin Qianyu sent Madam Li
to the clinic and saved her.

124
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,279
The Gu family is quite ruthless.

125
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,199
Lin Qianyu.

126
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,360
Huaizhou.

127
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm not responsible
for what happened to Madam Li.

128
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,959
Why won't you believe me?

129
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,600
Without your instructions,

130
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,480
would Madam Li be so bold?

131
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,279
Servants bullying their masters
has happened throughout history.

132
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,920
Why would you rather believe

133
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,930
the one-sided statement
of a murderer's daughter?

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,759
Besides,

135
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,680
she isn't a pushover.

136
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,160
She's my wife

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,439
and your cousin-in-law.

138
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
If you call her
the daughter of a murderer again,

139
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:11,959
I...

140
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,690
Mr. Gu, calm down.

141
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,319
In my opinion,

142
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,439
Ms. Li has a point.

143
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,439
Mrs. Gu has just joined the family

144
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,830
and has already won a good reputation
among the servants.

145
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,519
She also threw out Madam Li.

146
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,600
It's evident...

147
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,480
Mr. Chen is right.

148
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,879
Mr. Chen is right.

149
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,560
Shut up.

150
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,000
You're my mother's only relative.

151
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,759
Since you were little,

152
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,559
I doted on you like you're my sister.

153
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,000
I didn't expect to spoil you this much.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,559
I think

155
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,159
I should marry you off soon.

156
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,080
I will find a good family for you

157
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,580
and make sure you never have to worry
about food and clothing.

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,799
You know me.

160
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,559
I don't want to marry anyone else.

161
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,120
I just want to marry you.

162
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,600
I don't want to marry anyone else.

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,600
Have you...

191
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,679
fallen for me?

192
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,679
You're the one who has fallen for me.

193
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,080
You

194
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,600
treated me

195
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,320
as someone you liked.

196
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,720
Turns out you already have someone you like.

197
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,679
I wonder

198
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,840
which heiress is it.

199
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,750
It's none of your business.

200
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,279
Why did you want to see me then?

201
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,519
I'm just here to tell you something.

202
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,480
I want you
to sneak into Gu Huaizhou's room

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,910
and get me
the Gu family's shipping route map.

204
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,440
Gu Huaizhou's study
isn't accessible to anyone

205
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,120
if you're not summoned.

206
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,200
You should know this better than me.

207
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,919
That's why only by accomplishing this

208
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,870
can the pawn be qualified
to become an ally.

209
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,200
What can I gain from this?

210
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,200
I agree

211
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,080
to your terms.

212
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,240
It's really not easy

213
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
to be your ally.

214
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,480
But

215
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,039
I also need you
to help me with something.
