00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,660
=Ms. Nirvana=

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 23=

4
00:00:59,399 --> 00:00:59,920
Huaizhou.

5
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,320
What's the occasion?

6
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,519
Why prepare
such a big table of delicious food?

7
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,159
Huaizhou.

8
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:06,879
Sit.

9
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,640
A lot has happened recently.

10
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,990
We haven't eaten together
for a long time either.

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,480
Zhaoxue happened
to make some delicious dishes today.

12
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,959
They're all your favorite dishes.

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,400
I should have been
the one to prepare this meal.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,079
I didn't

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,239
do well.

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,120
Here.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,280
Huaizhou.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,799
Here's a toast to you from Zhaoxue and I.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Thank you for helping me and Jingzhou

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,079
and killing Zheng Yuzhen for me.

21
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,519
We're a family.

22
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,599
Don't mention it.

23
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,880
Thank you, Huaizhou.

24
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,799
Huaizhou.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,879
Try my cooking and see if it suits your taste.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,599
Yes.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,319
Here.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,280
It's yummy.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,680
I didn't expect Zhaoxue

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,760
to be good at cooking.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,519
Huaizhou.

32
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,000
There's one more thing

33
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,239
we want to tell you today.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,039
Zhaoxue and I

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
are planning to get married.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,280
Really?

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,639
That's great.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,199
Our parents are not around anymore.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,280
As the eldest brother,
I'm your guardian.

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,840
I'll arrange

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,479
a grand wedding for you.

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,560
Here.

43
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,520
Here's

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
a toast to you.

45
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,560
Eat first.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,300
I'll go to the kitchen
to check the dishes.

47
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,439
Just now,

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,879
Dr. Lu called

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,439
and said Li Qifa is dead.

50
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,439
This is what I worry about most.

51
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,159
Li Qifa's dead,

52
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,680
so the trail has hit a dead end.

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,940
We'll no way to find out
who's behind this all the more.

54
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,039
Is that so?

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
Let's not talk about this first.

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
Let's talk about our childhood.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,599
Huaizhou.

58
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,980
Do you remember the days
when we flew kites together as children?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,759
Of course.

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,039
When we were kids,

61
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,440
we used to fight
to see whose kite could fly higher.

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
You lost every time.

63
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,400
You always cried when you lost.

64
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,759
I didn't cry,

65
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,520
but you did fly that kite

66
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,759
higher than I did.

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,520
Later,

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,000
we fell for Fu Zhaoxue.

69
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,639
In the end,

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
you still didn't defeat me.

71
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,719
I wasn't happy

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,479
at first,

73
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,680
but I slowly realized

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,360
you're the only one

75
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,079
Zhaoxue cares about.

76
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,120
Five years ago,

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
I could have stopped you
from sending her home.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,839
But I didn't.

79
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,120
I was jealous.

80
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,000
Why does she only like you?

81
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,480
Zhaoxue and I

82
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,560
love each other wholeheartedly.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,560
We didn't mean to hurt you.

84
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,920
It's your inner self that's evil.

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,360
The Fu family's murder

86
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
five years ago

87
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,680
has bothered me all these years.

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,800
What has kept me alive until now?

89
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,240
It's to avenge the Fu family

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,480
and pay the Gu family's debts.

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,680
Looks like you can't move on after all.

92
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,000
Huaizhou.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,439
Do you know how much I want to go back

94
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,399
to when we were kids?

95
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,199
Do you know why you always beat me

96
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,839
when we flew kites as children?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
That's because I let you.

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,560
Commander.

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
We figured it out.

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,120
Li Qifa's identity

101
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,079
is fake.

102
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
He woke up last night.

103
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,790
I brought men
to interrogate him overnight.

104
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,800
He confessed everything.

105
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,079
He said

106
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,839
Gu Huaizhou is responsible for all this.

107
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,199
Mr. Gu.

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
Li Qifa isn't dead.

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,040
Looks like

110
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,480
the cat's out of the bag.

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,839
Gu Jingzhou was acting.

112
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,759
At this point,

113
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,160
there's no better way.

114
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,199
Mr. Gu.

115
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,959
I'll arrange for someone

116
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,360
to send you away right now.

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,560
I can't leave.

118
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,879
From what I know about Gu Jingzhou,

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,040
he must have had soldiers
surround the manor.

120
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,480
All he has to do
was his next move on me.

121
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,199
What do we do now?

122
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,800
Mr. Chen.

123
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,079
You've

124
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,600
been loyal to me all these years.

125
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,399
You're very hands-on
with the Gu family's matters,

126
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,279
big or small.

127
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,360
I know you'd do anything for me,

128
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,879
but this time

129
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,879
I can't let you take that risk for me.

130
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,079
Mr. Gu.

131
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,480
Well...

132
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,839
Take this.

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,879
Find a peaceful place

134
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
to spend your old age in peace.

135
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,839
This is the last thing I can do for you.

136
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:51,959
Mr. Gu.

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,879
I've

139
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,240
long regarded you

140
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,279
as my closest family member.

141
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,319
Mr. Chen.

142
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,279
Mr. Gu.

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,720
Enough said.

144
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,720
I

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,040
won't leave.

146
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,040
In that case,

147
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,480
we can't just be sitting ducks.

148
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,350
There's no one here.

149
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,120
Huaizhou.

150
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,559
Are you looking for me?

151
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,279
Huaizhou.

152
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,399
How did we brothers

153
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,960
get to this point?

154
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,559
I thought everything was over

155
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,540
after General Zheng
and Zheng Yuzhen died,

156
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,519
but I didn't expect

157
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,480
you to be scheming to kill me.

158
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,399
I've always indulged you
since we were kids.

159
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,840
Do you know why?

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,159
It's because
I'm not the Gu family's biological son.

161
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,480
All the Gu family's wealth

162
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,440
is due to my effort.

163
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,320
I endured so much hardship

164
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,159
and grievances,

165
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
but your father wants me

166
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,960
to give everything to you.

167
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,000
Why should I?

168
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,279
You can have the Gu family's fortune.

169
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,879
All I want is Xue.

170
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,679
I don't want your charity!

171
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,000
I want to fight for myself

172
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,600
and be my true self for once.

173
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,320
You

174
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,919
can't force affection.

175
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,240
If you're the one Xue loves,

176
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,120
I can back off.

177
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,840
But you're not the one

178
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
I like.

179
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
I didn't expect

180
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,360
that I still

181
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,200
couldn't get true love

182
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,399
despite my careful planning.

183
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,879
How am I no match for Gu Jingzhou?

184
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,639
Because you're selfish,

185
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,039
conceited,

186
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,120
and greedy.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,399
You would rather risk

188
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
the life of your loved one
for your future.

189
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,639
Who are you to compare with him?

190
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,080
I'm selfish?

191
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
