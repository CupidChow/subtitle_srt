00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,660
=Ms. Nirvana=

2
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Ms. Nirvana=

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,500
=Episode 9=

4
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,039
What are you people good for?

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm risking my life on the front line.

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,490
How can I fight in war without firearms?

7
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,990
Let's not forget about the opium.

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,959
This year's military pay
depends on this batch of opium.

9
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,280
Now that it's gone,

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
do you want my soldiers to starve?

11
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:10,719
Mr. Zheng.

12
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:11,959
Calm down.

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,319
We're already investigating this matter.

14
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,640
Investigate my foot!

15
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,690
What should we do
about the firearms and military pay?

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,879
Our company

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,319
will bear all of your loss this time.

18
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,840
Since we've cooperated for years,

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,640
I'll let this matter go.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,159
But

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,959
I must remind you.

22
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,159
Something like this has never happened

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,799
when your father was alive.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,319
Yes.

25
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,760
I'll replace all routes
as soon as possible.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,079
It won't happen again.

27
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,359
Mr. Gu.

28
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,480
You can't keep sacrificing.

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
General Zheng is filthy rich,

30
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,519
but our business will be emptied out.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,959
What do we do?

32
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,159
What do we do?

33
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,200
You're the manager of the firm,

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,959
yet you're asking me what to do.

35
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,800
Mr. Gu.

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,680
This has nothing to do with me.

37
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,120
Zhao Zhong.

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,560
Five years ago,

39
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,759
you switched from the Fu family
to the Gu family.

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,199
My father took good care of you.

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
I didn't expect you

42
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,000
to get involved in the shipping business

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,199
when my father has died recently.

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Mr. Gu.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,639
I swear to god

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
that I'll die miserably

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,759
if I have anything to do with this.

48
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,199
Mr. Gu is kind

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,319
not to let you die too miserably.

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
Kill yourself.

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,479
Fine.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,919
Since you still suspect me,

53
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,080
I'll...

54
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,919
Enough.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,039
Scram.

56
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,199
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

57
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,919
Mr. Gu.

59
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,439
Zhao Zhong was willing to die.

60
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,319
It's obvious

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
that he didn't hijack
the smuggling ship.

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,399
Whatever it is, we must replace and restore
the shipping route as soon as possible.

63
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:19,839
Mr. Chen.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,879
I don't trust anyone in the firm.

65
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,800
Handle this

66
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,360
yourself.

67
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,079
Yes.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,759
All routes were hijacked
at the same time.

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,439
I think
the shipping route map was leaked.

70
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,750
But you're the only one
with the complete shipping route map.

71
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,519
Could

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
someone else

73
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,519
have had access to the map?

74
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,120
Didn't

75
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,199
sleep well last night?

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
I went to the countryside to see Sitang.

77
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,879
Although it's the Gu family's house,

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,079
it's still not as good as Gu Manor.

79
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,959
Even I found the bed hard.

80
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,959
I don't know

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,759
if Sitang can stand it.

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,480
It would be good
for her to suffer a little.

83
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,160
She has to understand

84
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,870
that the Gu family's interests
are more important than anything else.

85
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,439
I will never show mercy

86
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,839
to anyone who harms
the Gu family's interest.

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,759
You're right.

88
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,879
We're a family.

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,000
We share

90
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,000
honor and disgrace.

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,399
If everyone could be as sensible as you,

92
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,319
I wouldn't be so tired.

93
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,439
What happened?

94
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,160
Is something wrong?

95
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,920
Something happened with the business.

96
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,720
I suspect

97
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,120
we have a mole at home.

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,439
So

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,600
are we moving out?

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,870
That's not necessary.

101
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,150
Things haven't been peaceful
out there lately.

102
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,319
We should go out less.

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,560
But didn't you say

104
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,319
we have a mole at home?

105
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,079
Will we be safe

106
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,360
at home?

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,519
It's fine.

108
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,360
I've arranged for Mr. Chen

109
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,120
to follow you everywhere.

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,120
Don't worry.

111
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,879
Thank you, Huaizhou.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
You're thoughtful.

113
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,240
Commander.

114
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,720
How's the investigation going?

115
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,879
Lin Qianyu
was born in a fishing village.

116
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,480
Her mother died during childbirth.

117
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,079
Her aunt raised her.

118
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,480
When she was 17 years old,
she was sent to Ping City

119
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
after Lin Fan was executed.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,319
There's nothing special about this.

121
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,260
I've also sent someone to Ping City
to investigate.

122
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,410
There will be a letter soon.

123
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,519
A girl who grew up in the countryside

124
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,399
and depended on others

125
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,800
is unexpectedly so ambitious.

126
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,120
How's it going at Gu Manor?

127
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,000
Gu Manor has been interrogating
all their servants these days.

128
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,600
Lin Qianyu is also under house arrest
and monitored.

129
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

130
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:20,839
Well...

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,839
You didn't ask.

132
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,240
There's nothing wrong

133
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,240
with your health,

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,319
but you must pay more attention
to your low blood sugar problem.

135
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,360
Besides that,

136
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,839
supplements may be good,

137
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,990
but you can't take it randomly.

138
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,920
Have you been taking any medication?

139
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,279
Can I have a look at it?

140
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,240
I left it

141
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,879
on the dresser in my room.

142
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:56,959
Mr. Chen.

143
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,920
Could you help me get it?

144
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,959
Okay, Mrs. Gu.

145
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,160
Lan.

146
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,519
Go get all of Mrs. Gu's supplements.

147
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,480
Okay.

148
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,360
What's wrong, Qianyu?

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,120
Are you not feeling well?

150
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,120
You're here, Commander.

151
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,439
Mrs. Gu just has low blood sugar.

152
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,360
She's fine.

153
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,879
Are you here to see Mr. Gu?

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He has gone to the firm.

155
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,720
I'm here to ask you for something.

156
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,399
You know

157
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,839
Commander's Department

158
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,360
has a lot of visitors daily.

159
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,320
I need some good tea
to entertain the guests.

160
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,759
The ones available on the market
aren't good enough.

161
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,759
Gu Manor has the best tea.

162
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Okay, Commander.

163
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
I'll have someone get it for you.

164
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,399
No.

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,519
What do they know?

166
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,840
I need you

167
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,240
to get it.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
Ding.

169
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,399
Mr. Chen.

170
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,320
This way, please.

171
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,080
What's wrong?

172
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,840
I can't tell you what to do anymore?

173
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,840
Commander.

174
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,399
That's not what I meant.

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,279
I'll

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,519
go get it for you now.

177
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,360
You

178
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,039
must be Dr. Lu of Lu's Clinic.

179
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,960
I'm Lu Heng.

180
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,960
Nice to meet you.

181
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,279
Commander Gu.

182
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,000
Dr. Lu.

183
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,600
Here are Mrs. Gu's supplements.

184
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,000
Mrs. Gu.

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,080
Stop taking these for now.

186
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll fill a new prescription
for you later.

187
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,600
Thank you.

188
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,510
Don't mention it.

189
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,120
You can talk first.

190
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll leave.

191
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,159
Dr. Lu, wait.

192
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,120
I have heard that Dr. Lu

193
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
is a good doctor.

194
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,759
Qianyu is weak.

195
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,759
We'll have to trouble you
to take care of her.

196
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,720
Don't mention it, Commander Gu.

197
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,110
The Gu family pays me
a generous consultation fee.

198
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,440
It's my job.

199
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,519
Where are you from?

200
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,080
When did you come to Hu City?

201
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,240
Where did you study medicine?

202
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,519
Thank you for your concern.

203
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,720
If you want to know me,

204
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,790
please come to the clinic another day.

205
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,519
I'll make a pot of good tea

206
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,360
and tell you.

207
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,799
I still have patients in the clinic,

208
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,600
so I'll leave first.

209
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,159
Take care, Dr. Lu.

210
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,519
You're really calm.

211
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,519
If you had come a little later,

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
this

213
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,159
might have been irreversible.

214
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,080
Have you

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,159
come up with a solution?

216
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,759
You've been trapped for so long.

217
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,240
With your intelligence,

218
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,000
haven't you come up with any solution?

219
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,799
Of course I have.

220
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,440
I just don't know

221
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,480
if you can do it.

222
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,159
That depends on whether we have

223
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,320
the rapport among allies.
