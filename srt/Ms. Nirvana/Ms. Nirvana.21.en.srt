=Episode 21=

4
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,679
Since I agree to marry Zheng Yuzhen,

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,359
it's to save Fu Zhaoxue's life.

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,239
If you disagree,

7
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,079
kill me now.

8
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,840
Do you think
I'd be reluctant to kill you?

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,680
Father.

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,439
Hurry over to Gu Manor.

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,280
I have Lin Qianyu with me.

12
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,120
Father.

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,680
Jingzhou.

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,799
Looks like
we can't escape this disaster.

15
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,239
As long as I can be with you,

16
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,120
even if it's an abyss right up ahead,

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,040
I'll jump

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
without any regrets.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,080
Enough.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,880
You're still acting
all lovey-dovey at such a time.

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
Are you

22
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,520
Fu Zhaoxue,
who mesmerized the Gu brothers?

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
I am.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,919
You narrowly escaped

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,719
when I wipe out the Fu family

26
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,919
five years ago.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,000
Today,

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,360
you're not going to be that lucky.

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,280
I

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,719
won't come back if I'm scared.

31
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,759
I just regret not fulfilling my promise

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
to kill all of you animals.

33
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,080
Darling.

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,199
Fu Zhaoxue.

35
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,759
Once you're dead,

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,039
Jingzhou is mine.

37
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,080
If you want to kill her,

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
kill me first.

39
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,439
Gu Jingzhou.

40
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,919
Don't push me.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,319
Even if you kill her,

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,719
I won't marry you.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
Do you think I won't do it?

44
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,960
Shoot him.

45
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,080
Gu Jingzhou.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
Is Fu Zhaoxue really worth it?

47
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,599
Yes.

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,680
Come on.

49
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,680
Shoot.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,840
Come on.

51
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,560
Shoot me!

52
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,159
Father.

53
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,800
Let Fu Zhaoxue go.

54
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,690
You're incompetent!

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,510
You're not worthy of being my daughter.

56
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,319
Father!

57
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,719
No.

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,520
Scram!

59
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,680
Father.

60
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,079
Father.

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,279
Father!

62
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,959
Father!

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,399
Father!

64
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,199
Gu Jingzhou.

65
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,160
Go to hell!

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,279
Mr. Chen.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,519
Hurry and untie Zhaoxue.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,079
Yes.

69
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,600
Jingzhou.

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,000
General Zheng and Zheng Yuzhen are dead.

71
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,879
Zhaoxue has gotten her revenge.

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,000
I finally don't have to pretend anymore.

73
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,079
What tricks are you playing?

74
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,199
Jingzhou.

75
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,680
Tell your men to stop pursuing Lu Heng.

76
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,800
He came here on my notice.

77
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,480
Jingzhou.

78
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,240
What are you still waiting for?

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,759
If something unexpected happens,

80
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,319
both parties will be in trouble.

81
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,600
Ding.

82
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,670
Ask them to stop pursuing.

83
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:50,759
Yes.

84
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,230
What are you still waiting for?

85
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,720
Hurry.

86
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,120
Huaizhou.

87
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,830
How come
you seem like a different person?

88
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
I

89
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,360
didn't do well enough before.

90
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,990
I don’t have a big enough vision.

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
But while you were injured and missing,

92
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,600
I realized

93
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,839
what it means to have a brother

94
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,839
with blood thicker than water.

95
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,879
So did you invite Zheng Yuzhen over

96
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,040
and point a gun at me

97
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,800
to trick them?

98
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:22,800
That's right.

99
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,759
It's the only way
to get General Zheng here.

100
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,920
I asked Mr. Chen

101
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,480
to inform Lu Heng in advance
to protect you and Jingzhou.

102
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,399
Okay.

103
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,920
You have such a thorough plan.

104
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,399
Jingzhou.

105
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,120
General Zheng is dead.

106
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,639
Will there be any riots in the army?

107
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,079
Don't worry.

108
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,079
I know what to do.

(Hu City's City Defense Department)

110
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,160
Thank you for your trust.

111
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not brilliant,

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,279
but you favored me.

113
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,399
Lately,

114
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
many things have happened in Hu City,

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,839
but you still believe me.

116
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,519
I won't betray

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
your loyalty!

118
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,959
We pledge our allegiance to Commander!

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,519
Look.

120
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,890
The flowers are blooming beautifully.

121
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,279
Xue.

122
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,319
I've already started
planning our wedding.

123
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,839
I will let everyone in Hu City knows

124
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
that you're my wife.

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,500
What's the matter?

126
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,800
Are you upset?

127
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,319
I'm happy, of course.

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,800
Marrying you

129
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,439
is my greatest wish.

130
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,279
However,

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,959
Jingzhou,

132
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,319
don't you think

133
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
this happiness

134
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,920
came all of a sudden?

135
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,720
I keep feeling

136
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,560
that something is wrong.

137
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,120
Are you worried about Gu Huaizhou?

138
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,480
I remember

139
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,580
that the people who assassinated us
when you were recuperating in the clinic

140
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,959
was sent by Gu Huaizhou.

141
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,920
That's just our speculation.

142
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,000
We have no solid evidence
to prove that they're his men.

143
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,759
I've also thought seriously

144
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,399
about what happened these days.

145
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,039
I didn't find anything wrong.

146
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:40,840
Xue.

147
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,639
Don't overthink.

148
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't worry.

149
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm here.

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,879
Father.

151
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,919
All the enemies

152
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,879
got what they deserved.

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,360
The Fu family

154
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,759
has cleared their name

155
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,360
and gotten justice.

156
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,120
You can rest in peace now.

00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,320
Don't burn it.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,250
I want to keep it as a souvenir.

162
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,799
Why keep such a thing as a souvenir?

163
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,720
It's bad luck.

164
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,039
Bad luck?

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Without it,

166
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,559
I won't be able to see you again.

167
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,039
It's a testament to our love.

168
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,250
Don't you thinks so?

169
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:55,720
You...

170
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,559
What are you doing?

171
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,759

173
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,399
Thank you.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,230
Commander Gu, don't mention it.

175
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,840
I've got some good news for you.

176

Xue and I

177
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,399

all these years.

182
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,320
I know that saying thank you
doesn't mean much,

183
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:23,840
but

184
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
I still want to tell you

185
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:27,879
thank you.

186
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,759
Zhaoxue, what are you talking about?

187
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,590
We don't need
to be so polite with each other.

188
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,200
No.

189
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,679
I need to thank you.

190
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,200

what happened,

00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,159
you were always the first to help me.

We're a family.

194
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,600
I should help you.

195
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,120
Seeing you do well

196
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,080
makes me the happiest.

197
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,279
Commander Gu.

198
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,639
Zhaoxue has suffered a lot.

199
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,120
You must treat her well in the future.

200
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,639
Don't worry, Lu.

201
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
I will take good care of Xue.

202
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,860
(Gu Huaizhou)

203
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,600
How long does it take
to travel from Ping City to Hu City?

204
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,360
Zhaoxue.

205
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,600
This man is here to...

206
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,960
Qianyu?

207
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,840
I finally found you.

208
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,720
Mister.

209
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,360
What are you...

210
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,200
Qianyu.

211
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,399
It's me.

212
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,639
I'm Qifa.

213
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know you.

214
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,399
How could you not know me?

215
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,879
I'm your fiancé,

216
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,840
Li Qifa.

217
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,240
Fiancé?

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,279
I really don't know him.

219
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,000
I got it, Qianyu.

220
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,240
They threatened you, didn't they?

221
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,720
It's okay. Tell me.

222
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,879
What did you do to Qianyu?

223
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,159
Mister.

224
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,440
What did you do to Qianyu?

225
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,519
Mister.

226
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,639
Calm down first.

227
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
Let's talk slowly.

228
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,960
What's going on?

229
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,470
(Marriage Contract)
My name is Li Qifa.

230
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,519
I'm from Ping City.

231
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,240
(This certifies, Lin Qianyu, Li Qifa)
Qianyu and I got engaged five years ago.

232
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,890
This is our marriage contract.

233
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,720
But Qianyu disappeared
shortly after the engagement.

234
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,440
I searched a lot of places.

235
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,639
And I finally found her today.

236
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,879
Mister.

237
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
My wife's name is Fu Zhaoxue.

238
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,759
Is it possible

239
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
that your fiancée

240
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,759
looks a lot like my wife?

241
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,200
How is that possible?

242
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,879
Here.

243
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:37,679
Take a look.

244
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,559
They can't look exactly the same,
can they?

245
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,440
It's indeed strange.

246
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,000
We need time to investigate.

247
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,790
You can stay at Gu Manor

248
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,840
for the time being.

249
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,600
Rest assured.

250
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
I'll give you
a satisfactory explanation.

251
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,120
No.

252
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:00,960
Mr. Chen.

253
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,990
Take this gentleman
to the guest room to rest.

254
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,720
Yes.

255
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,480
Sir.

256
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,350
This way, please.

257
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.

258
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,039
I'll wait for you
to give me a satisfactory explanation.

259
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,679
This guy

260
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,360
seems to be Lin Qianyu's fiancé.

261
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,759
What do we do now?

262
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,879
We must find a way

263
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,720
to make him believe

264
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,480
that Xue isn't Lin Qianyu.

265
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,919
You said
you would give me a clear answer.

266
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,679
How long has it been?

267
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,279
How long has it been?

268
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,960
That person
is clearly my fiancée, Lin Qianyu.

269
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,159
It's true.

270
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,679
The Gu family threatened her

271
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,039
and made her afraid to come out

272
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,159
and admit she knows me.

273
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,840
Hand her over immediately!

274
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,399
Otherwise,

275
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
I will report you
to the police immediately!

276
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:01,879
Mister.

277
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,919
Calm down first.

278
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,399
We're investigating for you.

279
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,320
Tell me when.

280
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
Tell me when!

281
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,840
Mr. Li.

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,759
Qianyu.

283
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,810
(Citizenship Certificate)
Let me show you something.

284
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,080
This is my wife's
Hu City identification document.

285
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,159
There's a stamp on it.

286
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,950
(China National ID, Name: Fu Zhaoxue)
My wife has never been to Ping City,

287
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,519
so

288
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,360
She isn't Lin Qianyu,
the fiancée you're looking for.

289
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,039
I thought I found Qianyu.

290
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,000
Who knew it's another fruitless effort?

291
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,159
We sympathize with you.

292
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,600
We'll continue to help you find her.

293
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,559
This is a small gesture from me.

294
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,320
Take it.

295
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,380
If you have any problems in the future,

296
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,559
come to Gu Manor to find me.

297
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,679
Thank you so much.

298
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,879
She really
looks exactly like my fiancée.

299
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,559
Sorry to bother you.

300
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,559
Sorry.

301
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:07,840
Okay.

302
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,679
I'll see you to the door.

303
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,960
Sorry.

304
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,440
How did you get this?

305
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,490
(China National ID, Name: Fu Zhaoxue)
I'm Hu City's City Defense Commander.

306
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,930
A trivial matter like this
can't possibly be difficult for me.

307
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,679
You're amazing.

308
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,120
You don't know

309
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,559
how scared I was

310
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,279
when he said he's Lin Qianyu's fiancé

311
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,559
when I first met him.

312
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,679
But

313
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,879
you're so smart.

314
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,919
Fortunately, you're here.

315
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,790
How are you going to thank me then?

316
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,639
Is that all?

317
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,519
Well...

318
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,039
Well...

319
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,879
What else do you want?

320
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Gu Jingzhou.

321
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
What are you doing?

322
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,720
