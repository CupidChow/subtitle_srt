1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,880
   

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,770
   

3
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,550
I'll tell you what you need to do today.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,950
Let's reset AG-3.

5
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,210
    

6
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,880
    

7
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,700
You all look sad.

8
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,290
We have to lie to a friend.

9
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,520
Lying is bad.

10
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,790
It's a lie for that friend.

11
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,340
That friend will misunderstand.

12
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,030
Then, you'll become sadder.

13
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,280
No. I'll become happy.

14
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,680
As long as he lives well.

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,530
It's a happy lie?

16
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,050
Very occasionally, there are instances when a lie can be better for a friend.

17
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,470
Let me go to work for one last time.

18
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,180
I'm asking you a favor.

19
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm really sorry.

20
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,450
Now that I'm about to leave, you choose to speak informally?

21
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,250
AG-3. Friend mode.

22
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,750
Nice to see you, friend.

23
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,190
Until now, I was pretty mean to you. Right?

24
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,710
It's fine. I am more generous than you think.

26
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,480
Should we get some air?

27
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,210
It's going to snow outside.

28
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,020
If it snows, that's better.

29
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:03,170
Three hours from now. Today, we might walk and run,

30
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,000
so if we return within three hours, your battery won't run out. Right?

31
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,710
Let's go.

32
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,580
 - Shoot!
 - Pass! Pass! 

33
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,920
 - Pass!
 - Pass! 

34
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,750
This is the school I used to go to.

35
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,110
I'm here for the first time in fifteen years.

36
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,700
 What happened? 

37
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,500
 Don't come near me. You look gross! 

38
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,940
 Oh my gosh. Look at him! He looks weird. 

39
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,890
  His face is like that, too. What is it? 

40
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:12,600
You didn't believe me, but I really had an illness where I couldn't come into contact with people.

41
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:21,190
But after I met you, I was completely cured.

42
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,640
It's really amazing, right?

43
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,530
I was crossing the street yesterday, and people looked like trees.

44
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,850
It was like I was walking through a forest.

45
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,910
The trees were not scary anymore.

46
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,040
Some trees looked interesting.

47
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,420
As for some other trees, I even wanted to touch them.

48
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:29,400
I realized then that I'm not going back to the past.

49
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,940
How adorable.

50
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,210
You did well.

51
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,610
You're more adorable.

52
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,530
It's snow! It's my first snow with you.

53
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,260
That's true.

54
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,200
Oh my, it's so cold. This won't do. I can't allow your battery to run out.

55
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,950
Are you afraid I'll be too heavy to carry?

56
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,450
That's right. You are very heavy.

57
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,090
   

58
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,680
The Velveteen Rabbit?

59
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,400
There was a stuffed rabbit that one boy really cherished.

60
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,740
It's a story where the stuffed animal wants to become a real rabbit.

61
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,180
So? Does it become a real rabbit?

62
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,660
Yeah. But the boy separates from the rabbit.

63
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,110
And when they meet again, he can't recognize the rabbit.

64
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,800
It's a sad story.

65
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,250
If you became human,

66
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,850
if such a miracle occurred,

67
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I would recognize you at the first glance.

68
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,820
Until now, you must have been saddened when you received my frequent scoldings.

69
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,730
Okay, today, I will give you a huge compliment. Listen well, AG-3.

70
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,300
What I showed you today,

71
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:46,710
it was my first everyday life in fifteen years and you have found and have given it to me.

72
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,370
For the last month,

73
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,160
you were my friend,

74
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,970
my treasure,

75
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,770
and my cure.

76
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:09,860
Also, you were a door to step outside into the world.

77
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,000
Every moment with you

78
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,270
was like a miracle to me. Thank you.

79
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,530
Also,

80
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,360
I am sorry.

81
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,950
I wasn't the one that cured you.

82
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,890
The longing for someone

83
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,520
you still had in your heart cured you.

84
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,530
Without me, you would've still been cured one day.

85
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,150
So now, whatever you do, make sure you're happy

86
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,720
and have fun.

87
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,770
I'll also give you a huge compliment, so listen well.

88
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:25,280
You... are someone that made me realize that I'm valuable.

89
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,790
You were my friend,

90
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,680
treated me like a treasure,

91
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,250
and allowed me to walk on a flowery path.

92
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,000
Everything you did for me,

93
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,650
I won't forget those feelings and will remember them forever.

94
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,550
Thank you.

95
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,850
And I'm sorry.

How can I help you, Master?

I will now

reset you.

102
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,690

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,950
He's a three-parter. He has a bad personality,  is mannerless, and unlucky.

165
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,930
He's only handsome. He looks like me, so it makes me feel even worse.

166
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,930
What?

167
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,660
Chairman Kim.

168
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,140
Where do we look similar? I really can't tell.

169
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,170
- I'm not completely sober yet. 
 - Ah, okay.

170
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,650
Excuse me.

171
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,670
I'm coming to work every day from now on.

172
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,070
Okay.

173
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,640
Hey—

174
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,480
No, you can continue what you were doing. I'll just go my way.

175
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,650
Good morning.

176
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,270
  How do you feel going to work like normal people? 

177
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,840
Lately, I'm so annoyed because of Baton and don't want to come to work!

178
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,730
I know, right? Why is here more often lately?

179
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,290
What's wrong with him? He was eating then suddenly...

180
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,070
 I even caught employees talking behind my back at the scene of the crime. 

181
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,410
 That's how most employees relieve their stress. 

182
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,360
 Therefore, I kindly let them go. 

183
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,750
Good work.

184
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:57,010
Since we don't know what might happen, make sure to take your smartwatch and a syringe with you at all times.

185
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,270
But where are you right now?

186
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,040
Even though you're busy, you should take care of your health.

187
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,820
Chairman Kim! How did you... You didn't even contact me.

188
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah, well... Oh, why are you eating by yourself?

189
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,290
Because I'm on your side, no one will eat with me. They say I'll cross the Jordan River.

190
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,530
So you are that upset about it?

191
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,570
No, it's not that.

192
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,910
After you finish your lunch, bring me the complete list of M&amp;A's that are in progress, under consideration,

193
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,410
and already complete.

194
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,460
Also, I want all of the financial statements from last year onward.

195
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,950
  The person you are calling cannot be reached right now. 

196
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,880
We worked so hard. If we don't get paid, then that's rude.

197
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,710
  The person you are calling cannot be reached right now. 

198
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,830
He's not answering. It's fine.

199
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,330
We have a lot of time. I'm going to keep calling.

200
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,710
Who do we get paid by?

201
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,190
Who do you think?

202
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,770
The CEO of KM Financial.

203
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,270
There's no way that the rebate only happened with Santa Maria.

204
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,960
Anything that looks remotely suspicious, make sure to separate it into a different pile and investigate.

205
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,420
Okay, got it. Oh, I heard that the AG-3 test has been finished.

206
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,330
Is there still no contact from Jang Doo Sam?

207
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,420
Not yet.

208
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,950
  
  

209
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,060
I think President Hwang will have a board of directors meeting soon.

210
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,450
I think it's probably to try to dismiss me.

211
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,160
We need Jang Doo Sam's recording so we can dismiss President Hwang first.

212
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,160
If Jang Doo Sam doesn't contact us, do you have a different solution?

213
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,750
It's not that we don't have a different method, but there will damages.

214
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,200
- Team Leader.
 - Yes?

215
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,740
Are there more files regarding AM Retail?

216
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,320
Hold on.

217
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,700
There were three instances of conducting a due diligence, but this one, in particular, seems to have been done late.

218
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,620
Take a look at this.

219
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,610
Are you not going home?

220
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,230
It's 1:30 AM.

221
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,540
My mom told me

222
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,020
that the water should come up until it reaches the back of our hand.

223
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,880
I already know that, but since we're making porridge and not rice, we need double the amount of water.

224
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,190
Oh is that so?

225
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,610
Ssanip, measure the water content in the vegetables, so we can know how much water we need.

226
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,170
Water content in squash is 95% and 90% in onions and carrots.

227
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,830
The amount of water we would need would be—

228
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:49,000
Wait, wait, wait. What are you guys doing here?

229
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,060
A late night snack. We're making you one.

230
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,780
You like abalone, right?

231
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,380
It's not good.

232
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,930
Hand it over.

233
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,580
If you gave it to me, you can't take it back.

234
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,730
You said it didn't taste good.

235
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,500
I'll eat this thinking about the effort you put in to make this.

236
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,870
  We'll be leaving this house soon. 

237
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:38,190
  - What? 
 - It's better for Kim Min Kyu if we all disappear from here. 

238
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,590
  Then, he'll be left alone again. 

239
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,600
 You made him depend on Santa Maria. You made him believe you. 

240
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,490
  Then take responsibility. Stay by his side to protect him, to support him, 

241
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,100
  and to help him endure it. 

242
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,330
  Keep him from getting lonely again. 

243
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,720
  I'm asking you a favor. 

244
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,890
If you're done, let's play.

245
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,210
Yeah, let's play.

246
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,460
We waited to play with you.

247
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,890
What should we do? Basketball? Soccer?

248
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,530
I mean,

249
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,460
at 2 AM?

250
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,380
The Rose of Sharon flower has bloomed.
 (Traditional Korean game similar to Red Light, Green Light)

251
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,050
-  The Rose of Sharon flower has bloomed. 
 - No, it's two in the morning-

252
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,750
The Rose of Sharon flower has bloomed.

253
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,870
The Rose of Sharon flower has bloomed.

254
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,060
 Good luck! 

255
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,690
But--

256
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,090
Okay, all right.

257
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,050
The Rose of Sharon flower has bloomed.

258
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,380
The Rose of Sharon flower has bloomed.

259
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,090
Don't move. I'm watching all of you.

260
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,450
- Hurry up!
 - I can't hold this for long.

261
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,680
Because she's holding on.

262
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,830
- The Rose of Sharon flower has bloomed. 
- Darn it.

263
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,460
You're it!

264
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,130
Tell my house that I'm going to bed.

265
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,300
 Turning on sleep mode. 

266
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,760
 Timing and Subtitles by The Robotic Team @ viki.com  

267
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,470
Hello?

268
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,400
Why'd it take you so long to answer the phone?
