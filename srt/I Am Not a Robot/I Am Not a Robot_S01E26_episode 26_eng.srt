1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,800
Come on in.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,820
There's no pillar in the middle of this room, so you will be able to use the space however you want.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,390
We can use that space over there for bedrooms and that space over there for the research lab.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,050
You're clearing all of this out, right?

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,810
If you sign the contract, we will get rid of everything for you.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
It's lacking a bit in the x-axis.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
It's lacking more on the y-axis.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,810
- However, the price there is very reasonable. 
- Very reasonable.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,960


10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,280
What's wrong?

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,860
Nothing.

12
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,520
Doctor,

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,330
tell me honestly.

14
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,400
About what?

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,160
You thought I was really going yesterday and got scared, right?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,640
Scared? Me? What?

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,390
Yeah.

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,080
I was scared.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,510
I didn't realize it, but when you said you would really leave, my heart suddenly fell.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,890
What? Why are you smiling?

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,610
- When did I? 
 - Right now.

22
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,710
You smiled like this.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,330
- Is it weird? 
 - Yes, very.

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,250
Do you think Kim Min Kyu  is doing well?

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,620
Leave that to Ji Ah.

26
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,560
The person who knows Kim Min Kyu better than anyone is Ji Ah.

27
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,560
  No matter what you 

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,060
  say to me, 

29
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,240
  or how you show yourself to me, I will come back. 

30
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,560
 Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, 

31
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,310
 I will come back every day to see you. 

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,110
It's cold.

33
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,730
It's warm.

34
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,480
If you come closer, it's warmer.

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,000
I think this distance is the best.

36
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,510
Is that girl going to come tomorrow, too?

37
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,390
Ah--

38
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,080
You really should stop opening the door for her over and over.

39
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,140
By any chance,

40
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,320
is there something you lied to me about, too?

41
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,890
If you have, tell me honestly now.

42
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,010
Just how can a person live without lying? Maybe angels could.

43
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,090
What about you, Young Master? Have you always told me everything?

44
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,020
You promised me that you'd buy an x-ray machine for me but the year has already passed and you never fulfilled it.

45
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,730
Ah...

46
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,610
Do you know the story about the hedgehogs?

47
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,950
It was so cold that they came together

48
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,460
but their quills pricked each other, so they scattered apart.

49
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,100
But once they did that, it was too cold that they ended up coming together again.

50
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,020
Instead of enduring the cold alone,

51
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,900
they thought getting pricked by each other was more bearable.

52
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,930
Right?

53
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,020
- Oh my, are you okay? 
- Ouch, it hurts.

54
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,360
- Is the child all right? 
 - Are you okay?

55
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,170
  Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, 

56
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,900
 I will come back every day to see you. 

57
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,060
Again,

58
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,460
a lie.

59
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,390
   

60
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,440
Jo Ji Ah.

61
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,670
Ji Ah.

62
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,090
AG?

63
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,690
It's not good to drink on an empty stomach.

64
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,230
Try this once.

65
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,480
They're really good to eat while drinking.

66
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,900
Am I your friend?

67
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,800
Who told you to speak informally to me?

68
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,730
The owner of these heart balls

69
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,590
was you?

70
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,600
Did you read

71
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,830
my statement?

72
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,650
You came in here to try to get me to reopen the final round?

73
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,260
Ah.

74
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,470
Ah, so that's why those things happened back then.

75
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,800
I mean, I was wondering why commercials regarding the youth entrepreneur competition played all of a sudden,

76
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,600
why I was able to see the scene of the protest, and why I received petitions.

77
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,140
I have a lot of things to tell you.

78
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,850
Can you listen to me?

79
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,220
I don't want to.

80
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,300
What more from you should I listen to in this situation?

81
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,440
Also, you... have a lot of guts.

82
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,180
I mean how can you keep coming here shamelessly after that?

83
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,630
What are you? Are you really a person?

84
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:58,000
Ah! You're not like a person, so is that why you pulled off acting like a robot so well?

85
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,590
I'm sorry.

86
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,040
Should I tell you what I was doing until I read your statement?

87
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,110
I waited for you... like an idiot.

88
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,570
Like some crazy person, without any pride.

89
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,260
I really hate myself for waiting that much for you.

90
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,620
You deceived me again.

91
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,960
But for worrying so heart-wrenchingly that you might not come, I hate myself for that.

92
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,400
How foolish I must look to you.

93
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,930
Did you say those words knowing that I would end up being like this?

94
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,220
No.

95
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,490
You should've just left me while you were still a robot.

96
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,330
Or if you were going to hide, you shouldn't have been caught.

97
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,530
Even if you were going to die, you shouldn't have been caught.

98
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,780
I'm sorry.

99
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,250
Sorry?

100
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,540
For what? What are you sorry for?

101
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,800
The fact that you pretended to be a robot and tricked me?

102
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,830
Is that all you're sorry for?

103
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,290
You knew my heart.

104
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,640
You felt it.

105
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,530
Just what did you think when you saw and felt all of that?

106
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:50,440
What were you thinking when you saw me wishing that you were human while looking at a human being?!

107
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,680
Also, the day I reset you. Okay.

108
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,170
When you saw me resetting you, how foolish I must have looked.

109
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,150
Was it fun? Besides me, how much fun was it for all of you?

110
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,210
How much fun did you have watching me fall for it all like an idiot?!

111
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,640
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,450
You pretended to not know me on the train, right? You also pretended not to know me at the restaurant until the very end, too.

113
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,900
Also... Yes, the warehouse. In the warehouse,

114
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,850
the day I told you countless stories like a lunatic.

115
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,810
How did you manage to stay still listening? Is that possible?

116
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,370
Is that really possible?

117
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:37,980
How could that be possible if you knew my heart?! How can you be like this to me?!

118
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,870
If I hadn't come looking for you again, you would have just pretended not to know me and continued hiding.

119
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,050
So why are you here again? Just why?

120
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,230
Are you that shameless?!

121
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,940
Were you ever sincere to me...

122
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,840
even for a second?

123
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,640
Why are you crying?

124
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,460
Now you want to prove that you're human?

125
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,990
That's despicable and sickening, so please get lost.

126
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,000
Can't you input that I want you to get lost?

127
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,130
Ah... because you're not a robot anymore?

128
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,230
Okay, I got it. Then I'll talk to you on a human level, so listen to this well.

129
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:43,890
Every moment I spent with you is horrifying to me now.

130
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,360
I want to erase everything.

131
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,030
I wish it would all disappear!

132
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,300
So from now on...

133
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,290
get lost from my life forever!!!

134
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,610
♫  Only if you turn your head  ♫

135
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,080
♫  You would see me  ♫

136
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,670
♫  Why don't you know?  ♫

137
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,290
♫  Then you shouldn't have   ♫

138
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,280
♫  Smiled like that to me  ♫

139
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,620
♫  Is it really okay  ♫

140
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,310
♫  For me to disappear  ♫

141
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:32,010
♫  For you?  ♫

142
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,780
♫  Up to here  ♫

143
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,070
♫  is the love that I wrote by myself  ♫

144
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:49,140
♫  Until today, this foolish love  ♫

145
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,820
♫  I will never come back  ♫

146
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,400
♫  I turn my back  ♫

147
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,970
♫  But not even a step  ♫

148
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:08,440

149
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:35,290


150
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,120
  
  

151
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,050
Do you know Jang Doo Sam?

152
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,840
Yes. He was the late Chairman Park Seong Jin's driver.

153
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,630
He would often visit my lab with the chairman.

154
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,660
However, is there something wrong?

155
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,040
He has a weapon that no one else has that can help us get rid of President Hwang.

156
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,380
We must get our hands on it

157
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,040
to protect Chairman Kim along with Santa Maria and AG-3.

158
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,710
However, I managed to get Jang Doo Sam's location earlier.

159
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,310
 These are my favorite manhwa (Korean equivalent to manga) books. 

160
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:14,070
 You should read them when you're bored. They're so fun that you won't realize that time is flying by. 

161
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,810
What business does Jo Ji Ah's friend have here?

162
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,670
Why do you think I came all the way here? To see your face?

163
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,520
There's no way.

164
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,010
I came here to give then take back the gift of your life.

165
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:03,130
Therefore, by the time I leave, you will be very upset. I guarantee it.

166
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,430
I don't have patience to listen to a long story.

167
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,820
The Santa Maria Team comes to my cafe often.

168
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,190
They'll find a warehouse soon and come back for their remaining stuff.

169
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,960
As for Jo Ji Ah, she will be leaving for Australia soon.

170
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,370
I don't care.

171
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,020
How can you not care? Then why did you open the gates for me?

172
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,900
Okay... From now on, here's the gift.

173
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,890
Yesterday, Ssanip cried while he was talking about yuzu bread.

174
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,740
Hoktal said that one day he will gift you an upgraded version of Beetle.

175
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:47,450
As for Jo Ji Ah, while making food for you to eat every day, she ended up with cuts all over her hands.

176
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,880
Only you will soon be left out of their memories.

177
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,930
The memories of the time you spent together will become just your own memories

178
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:03,820
and Jo Ji Ah will meet another guy besides you, right?

179
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,790
Wow!

180
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,560
Why do you think Ji Ah kissed you?

181
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,810
Since when do you think Ji Ah wanted to tell you that she wasn't a robot but a human being?

182
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:25,230
What do you think she was feeling towards the man who said he loved her thinking she was a robot?

183
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,210
Aren't all the answers to these questions a gift of life?

184
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,180
Since you can't see it with your eyes

185
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,450
and can only feel it, it should be a more beautiful gift.

186
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,590
You're going to lose that gift forever.

187
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,300
Where did Ji Ah go?

188
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,580
Ji Ah? She went to visit her dad.

189
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,560
- I'm thirsty, can I have a glass of water? 
- Eat and leave after.

190
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,500
- Food?
 - Yeah.

191
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:30,500
 If those people honestly confessed to you that day, then how do you think you would have felt? 

192
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:38,310
 Do you think the joy of AG-3 being a human would've been bigger than your feeling of betrayal? 

193
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,420
You must have actually gone crazy now, Kim Min Kyu.

194
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,340
Why would you come here?

195
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,100
 Here. Here. I brought fish cakes. 

196
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,600
 It's hot, so be careful. 

197
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,580
 Here. I'm sure Brother is also eating properly, right? 

198
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,040
 You will soon be left out of their memories. 

199
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,980
 Kim Min Kyu won't eat this. 

200
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,760
 The memories of the time you spent together will become just your own memories. 

201
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,960
 Did they contact us to send AG-3 over yet? 

202
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,610
That's Brother's car. That is Brother's car.

203
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,520
- Wait a minute.
 - Hey! Hey!

204
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,370
Brother!

205
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
 - That's his car.
 - Brother! 

206
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,020
 Brother! 

207
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,160
Brother!

208
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,320
Wait for me.

209
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,250
- Brother! 
- Brother!

210
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,350
 Brother!  

211
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,350
Tell me when you're done.

212
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,280
Thank you.

213
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,270
Dad,

214
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,780
have you been well?

215
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,270
I brought you a gift.

216
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:46,360
   

217
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,280
Thanks to you, I was able to gather strength and did it well.

218
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,210
The person I like, he liked the umbrella I made

219
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,760
and liked the heart ball a lot, too.

220
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:25,500
But I did something wrong and gave him a huge scar.

221
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,320
Still, I miss him.

222
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,320
What should I do?

223
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,490
 Finally tonight for an hour, 70 shooting stars are expected to fall tonight. 
  

224
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,020
 According to Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute,  

225
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,800
 the Quadrantids will become visible late tonight 

226
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,160
 and it will cover the whole night sky once it hits its peak tonight. 

227
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,190
Is this the umbrella from that one time?

228
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,370
I didn't know I had two of the same umbrella.

229
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,180
   
  

230
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,420
   

231
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,380
   

232
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,570
   

233
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,420
   

234
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,160
 So at some point,  

235
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,530
 you come to think that you are actually useless in this world. 

236
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,860
 How did someone think of this? 

237
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,640
 Maybe a genius? Or a master? 

238
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,620
 I want to meet  

239
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,880
 the creator of this umbrella. 

240
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:56,170
 One person gave me the feeling that I was actually really useful 

241
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,960
 and that I shouldn't give up. 

242
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,960
 You should kiss at this moment. 

243
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,060
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

244
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,580
♫  I want to call you  ♫

245
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,610
♫  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  ♫

246
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:03,700
♫  Repeating over and over the words of my heart  ♫

247
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,460
♫  No matter how much I yell  ♫

248
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:14,820
♫  It doesn't seem like you can hear  ♫

249
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,410
♫  Behind my happy front an unimaginable amount  ♫

250
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:29,130
♫  Of tears that I had to erase and erase again, you wouldn't know  ♫

251
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:34,240
♫  It's the first time having these feelings  ♫

252
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,960
♫  Even though I'm by your side, I miss you  ♫

253
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:48,650
♫  Even if it's just once, if I am in your arms and am calling your name  ♫

254
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,960
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

255
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,540
♫  I want to let you hear  ♫

256
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,680
♫  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  ♫

257
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:10,630
♫  Repeating over and over the words of my heart  ♫

258
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,220
♫  No matter how much I yell  ♫

259
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,720
♫  It doesn't seem like you can hear  ♫

260
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,310
♫  Every day, only in my heart and only with my eyes  ♫

261
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:36,700
♫  I could say the words of love for you  ♫

262
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:46,800


263
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,860
    
 - That's enough. 

264
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,750
 Thank you for telling me honestly 

265
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,380
 and for telling me everything I wanted to know. 

266
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,800
 How can you leave like that? How can you abandon me like that? 

267
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,000
 Don't go. 

268
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,510
 All that is left to do is for you to leave on your own. 

269
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,840
 I have a condition. 

270
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,790
 It's a favor... 

271
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,350
 Just what is going to happen after that? 

272
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,970
 I love you. 

273
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,250
 Bye, Jo Ji Ah. 

274
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,880
 Bye, AG-3.
