1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:15,680


2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,670
Hello?

3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,740
Why'd it take you so long to answer the phone?

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,020
If you answered the phone just a second later then I would've hung up on you.

5
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,540
I need a proxy buyer. The condition is the same as before.

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,520
Hello?

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,380
 CEO Jo, are you listening? 

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,160
Why aren't you answering me?

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,530
CEO Jo, say something.

10
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,320
You think I'm just here to take care of your boredom or something?

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,730
I will be your regular customer so take care of my boredom, too. I'm a bit bored these days.

12
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,780
You should go call a friend if you're so bored.

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,720
My best friend went somewhere very far.

14
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,490
 That's why I'm bored. I'm super bored. 

15
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,360
But why is your voice like that, CEO Jo?

16
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,050
Are you not well?

17
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,430
What do we do? I'm also leaving to a place far away as well.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,300
Where to?

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,470
Somewhere very, very far.

20
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,300
No, you can't! Then what about my proxy purchase?

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,760
Who am I supposed to call?

22
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,670
I don't do proxy buying anymore.

23
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,700
 So... 

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,170
don't ever call me again.

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
Hello? CEO Jo!

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,900
CEO Jo!

27
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,250
♫  It's very weird  ♫

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,750
 ♫ I'm loving you with all that I have. ♫ 

29
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:27,250
 ♫ How and who can do such a thing? ♫ 

30
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:34,760
♫  It really doesn't work out well for me even though I try  ♫

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,210
 ♫ Just like you back then... ♫ 

32
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,170
She should just be a proxy buyer. She's not fun anymore.

33
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,620
Master!

34
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,170
I will be sleeping over here tonight.

35
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,780
You go sleep in my room tonight.

36
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,270
Why would you want to sleep here when you have a nicer bed?

37
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,100
Over there...

38
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,360
I just can't seem to sleep. That's why.

39
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,390
When the late Chairman wasn't able to sleep,

40
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,770
this is what he did.

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,400
Pull your chin down and look straight at the lens, please.

42
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,230
I'm going to take the photo now.  One, two, three.

43
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,170
I'm here to get my passport issued.

44
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,470
- Australia?! 
- Yup.

45
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,180
It's called a working holiday visa. I will be able to work and also learn English at the same time.

46
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,660
How could you do that without even discussing it with us?

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,950
A year will go by quickly. This will help me make some money for a business venture and also gather some ideas.

48
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,220
I'll learn English so well before I return.

49
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,710
Your auntie will be responsible for teaching you your English starting from now on.

50
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,140
I don't have to learn English. Don't leave, Aunt.

51
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,340
- You are so adorable. I'll be back after my part-time job.  
- You should get some rest.

52
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,280
You just got discharged from the hospital.

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,600
I have to go make some money for my plane ticket. I'm off now.

54
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,150
You scared me. Why'd you come here?

55
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,020
Why do you think I'm here? I came here to fix up your old scooter.

56
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,440
You do know that what you are doing here is pretty random?

57
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,260
Last night, your motorscooter randomly appeared in my dream.

58
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,730
It was saying that it was on its last legs and it needed to borrow the hand of a god to fix it.

59
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,280
So that's why I'm here. And I'm that god's hand.

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,760
Forget about it. I can take this to a car shop. So just go.

61
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,980
Wow, Jo Ji Ah, you are so rich. You could just pay me to fix it then.

62
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,760
It will only take me thirty minutes to fix this. So just wait a little while.

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,230
Were you able to get some sleep?

64
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,810
Why do you care?

65
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,100
Because you're my creditor.

66
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,920
I have to pay off the debt but if the creditor dies unnaturally, then I'll be in a ridiculous situation.

67
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
You didn't understand what I just said, did you?

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,990
Seriously, you're such a...

69
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,110
This will be good for at least another month.

70
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,910
- Only a month? 
- You should get a new one while you're at it.

71
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,910
What if it stops while you're in the middle of the road?

72
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,310
What's wrong? I didn't focus on the right part of this situation again?

73
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,940
Don't come back here again in the future.

74
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,920
You told me to take responsibility, didn't you?

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,290
What I'm doing now is taking responsibility for what I've done.

76
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,890
I'm off now.

77
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,420
 There will be an urgent board of directors meeting just as you feared. 

78
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,520
 The agenda is your dismissal from office. 

79
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,870
The weather's nice, too, so smile.

80
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,570
If you save your smiles, they turn into poop, too.

81
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,690
Get lost.

82
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,470
Please come and take a look at these cute hats and gloves.

83
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,050
They are very pretty and will keep you warm so please come on take a look.

84
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,980
Hello there.

85
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,290
They are so cute.

86
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,420
- Can we try them on? 
 - Of course, you can. Would you like to try this one?

87
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,850
Yes, please. This one is so pretty.

88
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,540
- It really looks good on you, and it's really pretty. 
- Oh, really?

89
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,070
- How much is this? 
- It is 15,000 won. Would you like one?

90
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,990
Yes, please. Thank you.

91
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,730
Thank you.

92
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,350
You're more adorable.

93
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,680
- Can I take a look at these?
 - Yes, of course. Welcome.

94
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,450
This is so adorable. How much is...

95
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,490
Why are you making that facial expression? Is it because nobody is buying these?

96
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,110
I will purchase them all for you. Give me this one and also this one.

97
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,810
Give me this one here and just give me all of them. Come on, give them all to me.

98
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,310
- Do you really want all of these? 
- Yes, of course.

99
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,030
Here you go.

100
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,820
Give me all of them.

101
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,380
AG-3, we will soon turn you into a very handsome man.

102
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,070
Thank you, Doctor.

103
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,270
Please make me into a super-duper handsome man.

104
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,660
This is something that Kim Min Kyu used to say pretty often.

105
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,500
Pi, you deleted all of the backup files regarding Kim Min Kyu, right?

106
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,860
Yes, I did.

107
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,340
I wonder if she heard any of us say that?

108
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,950
 A part-time job at a parcel service? 

109
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,090
 Do you know how hard that work is? 

110
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,950
 No, it's not. I like it. It's the best when it comes to helping me stop thinking about stuff. 

111
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,960
- Hello. 
- Here you go.

112
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,320
Kim Min Kyu will be dismissed from the company by tomorrow.

113
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,460
The stockholders who are in my favor and the borrowed stocks will easily make us the majority.

114
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,880
Kim Min Kyu's dismissal is already a done deal.

115
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,220
The Santa Maria Team and AG-3

116
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,000
are pretty much in our hands now.

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,630
Tomorrow, Hwang Yoo Cheol, you will be the Chairman of KM Financial.

118
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,880
But, Father, you said that you would let me handle this case.

119
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,700
I did leave it up to you, but what happened?

120
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,450
Were you able to hand over that stupid robot to Martin?

121
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,990
No, I'm looking for someone who can take care of this properly again and—

122
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,320
Just forget about it all. If we take down Kim Min Kyu,

123
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,740
then all we have to do is hand over AG-3 to Martin. So why are you trying to do useless things?

124
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,910
I'm setting up the table for you,

125
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,050
and all you have to do is pick up the spoon to eat. So why are you so dissatisfied?

126
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,770
I'm even making Ri El yours, too.

127
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,680
No! Will you just stop it?!

128
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,450
Did you find Jang Do Sam?

129
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,430
I'm sorry, not yet.

130
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,980
That little rat.

131
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,670
Why did he have to come back to Korea anyway?

132
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,310
 If he possibly opens his mouth about the death of Chairman Park Seong Jin then we are all dead meat. 

133
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,500
Find him. Make sure to find him

134
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,820
and tape his mouth shut.

135
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,090
 You can't let him run into Kim Min Kyu, whatever you do! 

136
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,850
Hello?

137
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,800
Is this Jang Doo Sam?

138
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
You came by yourself, right?

139
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,430
As you can see, I'm by myself right now.

140
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,920
I'll have to think about it again.

141
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,530
Hello?

142
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,010
Don't find me until I contact you.

143
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,080
Mr. Jang Doo Sam!!

144
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,140
Don't look for me!

145
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,910
Jang Doo Sam!!

146
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,870
Crap.

147
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,710
Team Leader Jo?

148
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,940
I think there's something more behind Chairman Park Seong Jin's accident.

149
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,600
All that we can do now is go with Plan B, right?

150
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,490
  
  

151
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,310
   

152
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,420
    

153
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,710
  Ri El: Where are you? You haven't forgotten about our plans later, right? 

154
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,660
Your package has arrived.

155
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,220
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

156
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,750
- Hold on. I'll check it right now. 
 - Okay.

157
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,690
Is the dress from earlier prettier? Or is this one prettier?

158
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,170
Yeah. They're all pretty.

159
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,760
What's that half-hearted response?

160
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,920
No, what are you saying?

161
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,080
Can you sign this quickly?

162
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,850
Yes.

163
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,570
Here you go.

164
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,920
If it were Yoo Cheol...

165
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,740
  Hmm, I like the third one 

166
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,160
 because your neckline's pretty. 

167
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,450
Kim Min Kyu,

168
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,880
you've become super-duper handsome.

169
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,980
That's good.

170
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,660
That's good that he's doing well.

171
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,910
The chairman is arriving.

172
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,820
We'll start the meeting now.

173
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,240
As informed, the agenda is regarding Chairman Kim Min Kyu's dismissal from office.

174
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,070
The reasoning is to stabilize the company.

175
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,480
Do you think that's an acceptable reason for his dismissal?

176
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,570
Because of his bad-tempered

177
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,230
and weird actions,

178
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,630
trust towards our company has decreased.

179
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,250
Don't you all know that?

180
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,530
In order to develop a new company's culture that's suitable for the 21st century,

181
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,170
we can no longer accept the old ways

182
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,210
where the largest shareholder treats the company as his own possession.

183
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,830
And that's what most of us believe.

184
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,420
So far, how much profit did he bring to our company?

185
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,650
You only care about money.

186
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,530
You should think about our company's image, too.

187
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,730
Now the Chairman will speak.

188
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,330
Who's the next candidate

189
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,260
for this spot?

190
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,530
It's CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol.

191
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,260
In my opinion, after this Board of Directors meeting,

192
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,270
CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol will be the one being dismissed.

193
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,310
 Within Daeyang Shipbuilding, there is a R&amp;D team called Santa Maria. 

194
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,690
 That team did not make a ship. 

195
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,140
 They made 

196
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,640
 a robot. 

197
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,520
Everyone,

198
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,820
I introduce to you Doctor Hong Baek Gyun

199
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,800
and the Santa Maria Team, who made the world's best android robot.

200
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,720
Hello, I'm Hong Baek Gyun, the team leader of Santa Maria.

201
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,510
We're going to introduce to you AG-3, the android robot we made.

202
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,610
    

203
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,330
Three directors who had sided with President Hwang Do Won have now switched sides.

204
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,230
Your dismissal has been canceled and

205
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,180
now they are looking into the dismissal of CEO Hwang.

206
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:11,780
I will take responsibility for the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

207
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,330
From this moment on,

208
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,000
I resign from my role of CEO.

209
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,900
Do you feel better now

210
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,960
for dismissing me?

211
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,120
You should've done it earlier. It was this easy.

212
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,700
How did you endure

213
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,870
me being the CEO?

214
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,320
Hey, but,

215
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,070
I was trying until the end to not let go of your hand.

216
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,680
No, you'd already let go of my hand, Yoo Cheol.

217
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,720
Fifteen years ago.

218
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,260
That time.

219
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,770
  Sign here. 

220
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,500
  My dad said 

221
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,570
  that if you sign here, you and I can live together. 

222
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,640
I was a kid back then.

223
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,950
You knew what that document meant.

224
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,550
You knew, and until now, you've been pretending like you didn't. Isn't that the case?

225
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,050
Of course, even now,

226
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,630
whatever your dad does, you'll pretend you didn't know.

227
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,150
So, just like what you've been doing until now,

228
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,300
just pretend you don't know and move aside.

229
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,900
The opponent I need to fight isn't you. It's your father.

230
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,090
Oh, so is that why you dismissed me?

231
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,100
Because I'm not even worthy of being in this fight?!

232
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,720
Okay, then.

233
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,990
But would my father's blood disappear from me?

234
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,800
Be careful, too. Don't act all high and mighty, you bastard.

235
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,250
Dad, what did you just say right now?

236
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,410
Who got dismissed?

237
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,000
CEO Hwang ultimately made huge trouble.

238
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,020
Let's go. I made a reservation at the restaurant.

239
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,370
What about Chairman Kim Min Kyu?

240
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,520
He said he'd be getting some air.

241
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,640
Kim Min Kyu, where are you? Let's have a drink.

242
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,450
Let's do that later on.

243
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,650
 Here, have a drink. Did everything work out last time? 

244
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,190
 Yes, everything did. 

245
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,090
  The Velveteen Rabbit? 

246
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,670
 There was a rabbit stuffed animal that one boy really cherished. 

247
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,690
 It's a story where the stuffed animal wants to become a real rabbit. 

248
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,070
 - So? Does it become a real rabbit? 
- Yeah. 

249
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,530
 But the boy separates from the rabbit 

250
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,850
 and when they meet again, he can't recognize the rabbit. 

251
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,360
  Next year's spring, 

252
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,680
  the boy becomes healthy again and goes to play in the forest. 

253
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:12,000
  But one rabbit kept staring at the boy. 

254
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,490
 The boy mumbled, 

255
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,610
  "How cool!" 

256
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:27,150
  "That rabbit looks exactly like the one I lost." 

257
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,440
  Chairman Kim Min Kyu, you have to open this. 

258
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,300
  As promised, I'm giving you the heart ball as a gift. 

259
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,250
  I'm changing AG-3's face right now. 

260
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,690
 It's only eighty percent complete. The margin of error is still too big. 

261
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,680
  You have to wait until it's complete. 

262
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,150
It's better for Kim Min Kyu if I change it a day earlier.

263
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,110
AG-3, your face will change soon.

264
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,600
I guess my character's model is changing.

265
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,470
The starting point of all my mistakes was your face.

266
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,720
You have to correct mistakes.

267
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,300
Yes, I do.

268
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,990
Don't worry. No matter what face you have, you're still AG-3.

269
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,330
No matter what face I have, I'm still AG-3.

270
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,730
Then, AG-3? Sleep mode.

271
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,120
No!

272
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:16,380
Stop it. Don't do it! Just leave her as is.

273
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,830
Kim Min Kyu?

274
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,840
I have to find her again.

275
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,620
Who?

276
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,640
The AG-3 that I trained.

277
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,570
I shouldn't have reset her then.

278
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,700
I shouldn't have sent her away like that. I want to find her.

279
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,280
I have to find her. I have to meet her.

280
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,330
Give up!  You won't be able to find it even if it went through deep learning again with you.

281
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,960
No, I can.

282
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,460
I'll start again. No, I'll do the deep learning just like I did in the beginning.

283
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,200
What is wrong with you! Get back to your senses.

284
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,230
I miss her a lot.

285
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,710
I want to meet her again.

286
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,060
I long for her.

287
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Hi! AG-3.

288
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,660
I love you, Master. What would you like?

289
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,570
AG-3. Friend mode.

290
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,100
Nice to meet you, friend.

291
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,490
You didn't do it like that.

292
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,230
"What?" "Did you call for me?" "You called for me?" You did it like that.

293
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,980
Did you call me?

294
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,860
Right, that's how it is.

295
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,010
Let's do this well and meet again.

296
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,870
You got it, AG-3?

297
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,600
It is a cat.

298
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,100
It is Master.

299
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,470
Ah, it is a cat.

300
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,740
Ah, it's Master.

301
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,950
Ah, it's a cat.

302
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,520
Right, that's it. Good job!

303
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,600
Hold on. The next one was, uh. I use this as perfume, but

304
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,120
you use this as a cleanser.

305
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,740
Using perfume from France as a cleanser is a stupid thing to do.

306
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,310
What do you think?

307
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,870
Is this my room?

308
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,900
Where's the charger?

309
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:54,340
You're my treasure from now on. But if I were to sell you, how would you react?

310
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,750
Before selling me, you have to reset me.

311
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,140
There's only 10% of battery left.

312
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,990
Will you set me into sleep mode?

313
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,140
It would be so nice

314
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,070
if you could remember all the time we spent together.

315
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,470
What must I do for them to return?

316
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,900
What do I have to do

317
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:42,330
so that I can meet the version of you from the past?

318
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,550
Master, are you the same as the past version of yourself?

319
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,800
No.

320
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,300
Who I am now

321
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,260
is very different from how I was back then.

322
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,870
Then you cannot meet the old me ever again

323
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,670
because the inputs are different.

324
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,530
Yes, have you arrived?

325
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,890
Yes, I'm currently in Daegu right now. The agreement ceremony is going as we planned.

326
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,940
But, you're not coming in a car?

327
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,090
No, I just thought it would be nice to get some fresh air since it's been a long time.

328
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,900
I wanted to see the people around me as I went, too.

329
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,970
You don't need to pick me up at the station. I'll just meet you at the center.

330
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,260
 A meteor shower occurs when dust from comets or asteroids comes in contact with the Earth's atmosphere 

331
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,590
 and burns. 

332
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,170
 It's a great site where shooting stars fall down like rain, 

333
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,340
 which makes it appear to be raining. 

334
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,000
 This meteor shower that will occur is due to an asteroid that got sucked  

335
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,970
 into Earth's atmosphere. 

336
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:21,570


337
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:57,260
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

338
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,840
♫  I want to call you  ♫

339
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,960
♫  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  ♫

340
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:14,000
♫  Repeating over and over the words of my heart   ♫

341
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,560
♫  No matter how much I yell  ♫

342
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:25,060
♫  It doesn't seem like you can see my heart  ♫

343
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,000
♫  Behind my happy front  ♫
