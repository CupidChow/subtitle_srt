00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,190
This is your third re-examination. Is that correct, Mr. Kim Min Kyu?

3
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,070
Remove the hat and the mask.

4
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,250
Don't make me say it twice. Remove the hat and the mask.

5
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,430
This person has a strong allergic reaction if he comes in contact with a human being.

6
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,580
Well, that's interesting. Is there such an illness?

7
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,400
The name of the disease isn't even written on the diagnosis.

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,000
No, there isn't. I'm a dermatologist, yet I have never heard of it before.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,110
I've seen many diagnoses of mental illnesses to receive military service exemption, but this is the first time I'm seeing this.

10
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,890
Mr. Kim Min Kyu, you don't want to serve in the military to this extent?

11
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,320
Is the Korean military a joke to you?

12
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
Don't you feel sorry towards the others who are serving in the military?

13
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,300
Kim Min Kyu, categorized to level 1 military service... What are you doing right now?

14
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,400
What is it? Why are you taking off your shirt?

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,390
Are you saying you want to pick a fight with the Ministry of Defense right now?

16
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,350
Sit down.

17
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,850
Hurry up and sit down. Sit right now!

18
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,560
I can also be scary when I take off my jacket.

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,300
Hurry up and sit down!

20
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,960
I... am hoping to enlist in the Marines. Will it be possible?

21
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,650
N-No. That doesn't seem possible.

22
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,490
This happens when I come in physical contact with others.

23
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,480
The symptoms... get worse the longer I stay in contact.

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,990
There is no way to prevent it. Weaker allergic reactions could be treated with medication.

25
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,380
Stronger reactions need to be treated with a shot.

26
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,990
Of course, it's not contagious.

27
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,620
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,300
Anything else you're curious about?

29
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,690
Young Master, everything is ready.

30
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,960
It has already been a year since you came to me.

31
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,690
With that small body of yours, you showed me what devotion was

32
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,740
every single day.

33
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,280
My thoughtful and honest bride.

34
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,810
Happy birthday, my beautiful one.

35
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,890
Here.

36
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,830
Here, your birthday gift.

37
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,580
Change your battery and stay by my side for a very long time, okay?

38
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,570
So cute.

39
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,290
Yes!

40
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,420
 Contrary to what you all think, I'm living well on my own. 

41
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,140
 If the world came to an end and had to leave only one person alive, 

42
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,320
 that person would be me. 

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,960
That's right, that's right.

44
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,720
 I have acquired a million skills to live on my own. 

45
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,690
 Among people, distance is needed. 

46
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,040
 Space to protect 

47
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,220
 myself 

48
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,850
 is needed. 

49
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,520
Student, l'll hold your place for you. Go to the restroom and return quickly.

50
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,030
Really? Thank you.

51
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,450
 My treasure that CEO Jo got me! 

52
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,970
 Do you see it, the overwhelming existence of this pristine packaging? 

53
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,850
 - I love you, CEO Jo. 
- You're the Wonder Woman of forwarding services. 

54
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,620
Everyone, my stomach is about to explode from getting so full off of your compliments.

55
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,190
Excuse me, so... what are you guys doing here?

56
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,040
Oh, here?

57
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,430
We're holding our grounds to get the limited edition item. 
   

58
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,020
If you need someone to purchase something for you, call me. With many years accumulated know-how,

59
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,220
no matter what kind of limited edition product it may be, I'll be able to get it for you.

60
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,810
Ah, you're the CEO!

61
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,730
But how come you're so young!

62
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,380
Aigoo, hello... You guys are working hard.

63
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,580
Excuse me. I have started many businesses and failed a lot of them, too.

64
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,330
So all I have left with me are my debt and my nasty temper, kid.

65
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,210
Ah, I see. But why are you dropping your honorifics all of a sudden?

66
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,690
I don't understand.

67
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,410
I'm speechless.

68
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,140
Hey, you manner-less, brain-less, conscience-less jerk!

69
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,150
Do the people waiting here look like dogs and pigs (pushovers) to you?

70
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,510
- I never said you guys were dogs and pigs. 
- How dare you cut in line?

71
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,440
You better get lost in 3 seconds,

72
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,630
before I shove a toothbrush made out of your plucked nose hairs into your mouth!

73
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,390
What nose hair are you even talking about?! And when did I cut in line?

74
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm not even interested in limited edition products!

75
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,410
I'm not interested at all.

76
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,940
Go! Leave!

77
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,190
Do you know who I am? Do you guys know who I am?

78
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,000
- Did something happen?  
- Oh no, nothing much happened. Sit, sit...

79
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,120
- You all waited a lot, right? 
- Yes.

80
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,470
Now we will start admitting people.

81
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,940
We will be grateful if you slowly enter in the order that you're sitting in right now.

82
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,270
You may enter. Thank you and welcome.

83
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,810
Move! It's mine! Move, it's mine!

84
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,690
Seriously? Who said that the Republic of Korea is a developed country?

85
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,080
   

86
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,900
 ♫ Don't frown, you have ♫  

87
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,210
Yes, Customer. It's a success. Where should I go for in-person delivery?

88
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,920
To the back seat.

89
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
What? A speaker?

90
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,280
Can you hear me saying to put it in the back seat?

91
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,400
That's not right.

92
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,630
You'll get your item when you pay up, so give me the remaining fee.

93
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,120
I already paid the necessary amount in advance. I promised to pay you double the amount for your proxy service when we meet in person.

94
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,170
However, the only condition is that the box of my item needs to be perfect.

95
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,180
Then examining the box should be the priority here.

96
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,920
You are such a doubtful man.

97
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,800
Fine then. I'm confident when it comes to the items I procure.

98
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,940
My goodness.

99
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,340
No. This can't be! No, no, no!

100
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,690
Customer, you need to pay me double. ₩300,000 as the commission you promised me for pulling an all nighter.

101
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,780
- There is no way I will pay you.
 - Pardon?

102
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,010
There is already something on the box.

103
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,410
And there is no way I will be able to find another one. This is not part of the contract.

104
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,500
Yet, you are asking me to pay up?

105
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,840
The box was perfectly fine when it was in my hands a moment ago.

106
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,360
But as soon as I handed it over to you, something went wrong, so I deeply apologize to you.

107
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,630
Is that what you thought I would say? How dare you try to rip me off!

108
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,060
You're the one that was trying to rip me off!

109
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,110
I might forgive when mistakes are made, but I don't let people slide when they lie.

110
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,240
I can't believe you. Hey!  You, get out of the car.

111
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,360
You're serious? You locked the front door-- You even locked the back door?

112
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,210
You dare try to dine-and-dash with me?

113
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,140
I won't  give a cent of my money to a con-artist like you.

114
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,320
Hey, you're messing with the wrong person here. Hey, get out of the car.

115
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,610
Hey!  You, get out of the car. Open up. Get out of the car, you jerk!

116
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,750
I will post a review about this purchase, so go and repent; and let's not see each other ever again.

117
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,310
You useless crap.

118
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,490
Hey, where are you going?! Hey! Hey!

119
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,560
What was that? What was that sound?

120
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,450
Did I just hit her? Did I just do that? No, it can't be. No, that can't be right.

121
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,280
Damn it, seriously.

122
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,530
Hey.

123
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
CEO Jo. Hey.

124
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,510
Hey!

125
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,630
Seriously, man.

126
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,750
So handsome.

127
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,980
Hey! How dare you try to run away!

128
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,310
Get away, get away from me!

129
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,370
Let go! Let go! I told you to let go of me!

130
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,300
- Hey! 
- Gosh, really!

131
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,440
I told you to let go of me!

132
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,320
- Let go! Your hand! 
 - Hey!

133
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,630
Just go away!

134
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,670
Hey!

135
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:45,670
I got beat up once while trying to receive my pay from a part-time job.

136
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,140
Do you think I will let you go for something like this?

137
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,530
Give me money now! Pay up, you jerk!

138
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,340
Hand it over, you dine-and-dash jerk!

139
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,070
Stop right there!

140
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:18,140

141
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,490
Hello, Dr. Oh.

142
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,860
How did you manage to get another attack after the one at the military office?

143
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,730
You should be more careful.

144
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,600
Check out the hives more carefully.

145
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,080
Don't you think the shape changed a little?

146
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,960
It's still the same.

147
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,870
Please look at it more carefully.

148
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,220
Until now, it was circular but this one is a little bit different.

149
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,570
This can be a crucial information to figure out my illness.

150
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,750
That is just a pimple that's not developed yet.

151
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,710
Earlier I had a cold sweat, so how about you gather some of my bodily fluids?

152
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,130
If you want, I can. But the result will be the same.

153
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,670
Why don't you have more passion and sincerity for goodness sake!? I am a patient, you know.

154
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,210
You're my primary doctor, so with a sympathetic heart,

155
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,080
you should be clinging onto even a small piece of information like this. Shouldn't you!?

156
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,850
I've done enough of that for the last 15 years.

157
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,670
Your illness is one that does not exist in the world right now.

158
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,600
Unfortunately, there is no other way than living while avoiding contact with other people. It's time for you accept that fact.

159
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,420
What about that new medicine that just came out into the market?

160
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,050
There is no such thing as that since we tried everything that's out there.

161
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,310
However, I did get my hands on this medical smart watch.

162
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,210
This has been developed in Sweden recently and they are going through some beta tests at the moment.

163
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,370
This watch senses your pulse and temperature change, calculates your allergy level, and displays a color corresponding to its severity on the screen.

164
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,040
Normally, it's blue, but above 100 is yellow. And as the number goes up, you'll experience an early rash and have trouble breathing.

165
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,580
Above 1000, it will turn orange and your whole body will  break out into a rash soon.

166
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,630
When it goes beyond 2000, it will turn red. Then a few seconds later—

167
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,370
I will die of shock? But I never went beyond 2000 though.

168
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,620
You never know what the future will bring.

169
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,220
What good will it do even if I wear this?

170
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,710
I can't even date nor get married.

171
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,600
I will be living as this hideous monster forever anyway.

172
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,920
But don't you think there will be at least one woman somewhere in the world that would be interested in you?

173
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,170
If there happens to be one out there,

174
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,910
I'm pretty sure that woman isn't in her right mind either.

175
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,030
That dine-and-dash jerk!

176
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,990
There will be an end to your sweet dreams from now on.

177
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,340
You'll be having nightmares every night due to my grudging curses!

178
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,330
It won't end even if you beg the earth and sky.

179
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,480
What is that?

180
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,370
Left. To the left.

181
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,310
Sunbae, can you be quiet a little?

182
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,740
- To the right.
 - I can't get a signal.
 - Hey, why is his house so...

183
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,060
- Where do I put it? 
- Find an open window.

184
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,670
- I can't see.
 - One here.

185
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,720
- There. There. Find the right angle. 
- Here?

186
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,270
What? What is that?

187
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,970
Who the hell was it?!

188
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,920
- He got it. 
- He got it.

189
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,130
- He got it! 
 - We did it!

190
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,750
Run. Run! Quickly!

191
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,710
He got it!

192
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,790
What the heck is that?

193
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,050
Daeyang Shipbuilding?

194
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,350
That's the shipping company I recently acquired and put up for sale.

195
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,260
 AG-3 is playing squash right now.  

196
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,290
 Skills to track motion, calculate the next line of trajectory, 

197
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,760
 and respond to the ball, as you can see, are excellent. 

198
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,630
 But Doctor, isn't it too dark?  

199
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,670
 - Is that the end of this scene?
 - Open up the curtains.  

200
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,830
 - Open the curtains. 
- Okay. 

201
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,180
 Are you all right, Doctor? 

202
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,480
 What's wrong with this? 

203
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,790
 Are you all right, Master? 

204
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,620
 Yes, I'm all right.  

205
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,010
 Take this and continue filming. 

206
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,200
What the?

207
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,380
 Yes, I'm already filming it. 

208
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,400
It's a robot?

209
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,640
 Yes, you can walk in.  

210
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,890
 Hello, Chairman Kim Min Kyu. I'm Doctor Hong Baek Gyun. 

211
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,370
He knows me?

212
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,870
 You are invited to the demonstration of android robot, AG-3, that will shock the world. 

213
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:19,030
 Why? According to this contract, you are the new owner of the AG's. 

214
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,790
 Come quickly with the fifty billion won that has not been paid yet 

215
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,790
 out of the total of hundred billion won research fund. 

216
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,810
 For your information, this video you've seen will, in three seconds, explode— 

217
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,760
 It won't. 

218
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,190
 Did I startle you? 

219
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,640
 I am confident that you will be shocked like never before once you've seen AG-3 yourself. 

220
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,800
 Awaiting the new owner of AG-3, the android robot that will shock the world. 

221
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
 And with that, I'm done. 

222
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:03,520
I am that robot's new owner?

223
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,220
   

224
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,130
  [ 

225
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,790
   

226
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,030
Who does he think I am?

227
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,490
   

228
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,630
Hong Baek Gyun, you will go back to that place.

229
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,850
You must go back no matter what.

230
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,460
   

231
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,370
Seriously.

232
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,500
What the! Surprised me.

233
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,180
What is that?

234
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,400
What is this?

235
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,290
I mean I told you already that I don't need any of this. Get rid of the people, too,

236
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,530
so I can see AG-3 only.

237
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,660
What?

238
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,690
Follow that?

239
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,400
Seriously.

240
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,220
My heart.

241
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,880
Seriously.

242
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,820
What the heck is this?

243
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,870
Hello?

244
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,380
Anyone here?

245
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,220
Are you Chairman Kim Min Kyu?

246
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,490
   

247
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:22,600
I couldn't find any data. Are you Chairman Kim Min Kyu?

248
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,490
How do you know me?

249
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,740
Nice to meet you. Let's shake hands.

250
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,010
Don't come.

251
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,840
Go. Go over there.

252
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,430
Go over there!

253
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,370
Is anyone here?

254
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,000
Why is he so worked up?

255
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,370
 Anyone here, I said!! 

256
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,630
I've heard that his nickname is "Baton," but he really carries a baton with him.

257
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,390
Seriously.

258
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,630
Do you dislike shaking hands? I'm sorry.

259
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,640
From now on, I will be cautious of it.

260
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,230
Hell! I said to get rid of humans!

261
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,570
Do I seem like a human to you?

262
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,780
Doctor said the more you see me as a human, the better I am doing.

263
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,490
Thank you. But I am not a human.

264
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,440
What?

265
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,920
I am AG-3, an android robot made by Doctor Hong Baek Gyun.

266
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,010
AG-3? Robot?

267
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,620
Yes.

268
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,090
Doctor told me that you would be very pleased with me.

269
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,190
Are you pleased with me?

270
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,950
What a con! How dare a person act like a robot!

271
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,170
You don't think I can tell the difference?

272
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
What are you doing now?

273
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,690
I will help you believe that I am a robot.

274
