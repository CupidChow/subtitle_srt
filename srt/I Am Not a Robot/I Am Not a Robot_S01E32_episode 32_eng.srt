1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,300
Ah, all of a sudden the back of my head hurts.
    

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,630
This won't do. Come to our house.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,850
Huh?

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,970
Now my brother won't ask for his resignation letter back with his own mouth even if he has to die.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,000
So, very naturally, you have to come to our house

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,200
and very naturally return his resignation. Right in front of my sister-in-law. Like that!

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,650
Then, there's no way my brother will refuse to take it back.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,140
I know what you're saying. I-I can do this well. Okay.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,420
And... if I go to your house,

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,250
can I see your bedroom?

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,170
No, no. You can't. My room is too messy.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,340
You barge into my room all the time, but you say I can't see yours.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,460
 Actually, I... 

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,760
 I guess the studying paid off.  

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,980
Just try it and see if I'll kill you or not.

16
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,680
 What the heck? You video called me knowing I was in the bathroom, right? 

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,950
 No, it's because I wanted to talk to you face-to-face. 

18
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,900
 It hasn't even been that long since you saw me. 

19
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,780
So cute.

20
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,070
Aigoo, I can't watch this.

21
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,430
How can everyone have a partner except for me?

22
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,170
I'm sad.

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,630
Even the sauce is designed for a couple. Ugh, I don't like it.

24
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,770
Eddie?

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,570
Jane?

26
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,430
When did you come to Korea? Wait, this isn't it. Wait a second.

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,290
When did you come to Korea?

28
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,900
I-I mean, how come you are in Korea?

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm just here for a business trip for like a couple of months.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,370
Business trip.

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,000
Dear God, thank you!

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,890
What did you just say?

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,050
It's nothing.

34
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,310
Anyways... I mean, it's great to see you again, Eddie.

35
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,330
Are you here with someone or do you want to come with us?

36
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,540
Absolutely. Let's go. Let's go, Jane.

37
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,840
Cheers.

38
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,970
Oh my God.

39
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,620
Yes. One more time.

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,310
There are still a lot of people at this time.

41
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,630
It's fun people watching.

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,710
This feeling is nice.

43
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,620
I like it, too.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,930
I feel like we were cooped up in our research facility for too long.

45
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,380
We were making a robot that shared emotions with human beings,

46
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,670
yet we ourselves were lacking in human interaction.

47
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,290
It's because everyone was busy already with work.

48
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,200
In the future, we should spend time like this often.

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,130
Okay.

50
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,000
What do you think is around that corner?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We can just go and find out ourselves.

52
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,560
We can.

53
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,290
I see that you put on a great show.

54
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,470
You're tricking innocent kids. Are you happy?

55
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,960
Yoo Cheol will be reinstated to the position of CEO soon.

56
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,430
Yoo Cheol and Ri El will live out their own lives now.

57
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,320
And we will change KM Financial to become different from what it is now.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,090
You ignorant punk.

59
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,700
You and my father ended your relationship badly, but

60
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,140
Yoo Cheol and I are different.

61
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,900
We will not repeat the mistakes of the past.

62
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,500
 I guess everything is really over now. 

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,270
How do you feel? Are you relieved?

64
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:06,700
Well, I'm not as relieved as I thought I would be.

65
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:16,150
Just... that the things of the past won't be able to hurt me anymore. That kind of feeling?

66
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,090
And how great is that? Your wounds have healed.

67
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,430
Although you don't know when you will be hurt again.

68
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,670
Well then, I'll befriend wounds, too.

69
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,200
That's right. A little less painfully, a little less sadly.

70
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,560
When you live appeasing it like that, time will pass, too.

71
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,690
Uh, Doctor. I think I'll have to hang up. I have an urgent call.

72
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,690
Is it Jo Ji Ah?

73
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,570
If you act like this, I'll be hurt.

74
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,250
Doctor, I'll call you back quickly.

75
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,740
Yes?

76
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,550
My brother is at home now. Hong Joo is also here.

77
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,640
Oh, yeah? Okay, I got it.

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,770
But I'm wearing a suit right now, and I don't even have a tie on.

79
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,700
- That's perfect.
 - Really? Okay.

80
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,350
Wait, but what does your niece like?

81
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,790
   

82
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,610
So why did you make that kind of a mistake (and end up like this)?

83
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,160
Dong Hyun, I'm sorry.

84
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,430
No matter what anyone says, I'm on your side, Dad.

85
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,000
- Chairman. 
 - Nice to— No.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,770
Hello.

87
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,800
What brings you to my house?

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,430
Oh, Ji Ah? Ji Ah!

89
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,810
No. No. I'm here to see you.

90
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,580
Oh, it's Mr. Kim Min Kyu!

91
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,550
Hello, Jo Dong Hyun.

92
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,260
How do you know my daughter?

93
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,900
Ah, that...

94
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,890
- It's a secret. 
 - Secret?

95
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,680
It's a secret.

96
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:42,450


97
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,610
Do you like stewed chicken?

98
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,120
- Ah, yes. 
 - Then, let's eat together.

99
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,500
Cute.

100
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,570
She looks exactly the same as she does now.

101
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,950
I really wanted to meet you.

102
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,770
What?

103
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,770
MIster, is your allergy better now?

104
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,720
Yeah. It's all better now.

105
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,170
The person that you really liked back then was my aunt, right?

106
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,530
Yes, that's right.

107
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,430
But that's a secret.

108
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,280
You see, I wasn't quite sure what was good to buy, so...

109
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,430
You didn't have to get me something.

110
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,980
Wow! It's pretty.

111
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,550
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

112
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,060
Wow! So cute!

113
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,740
It's beautiful.

114
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,900
Don't they look like they're on some blind date?

115
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,740
I know, right?

116
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,640
- Chairman. 
 - Yes?

117
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,520
What is your purpose for coming here?

118
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,240
That... I...

119
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,870
I don't think I can be without Team Leader Jo.

120
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,130
Pardon?

121
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:26,010
Team Leader Jo, I like you. Very much.

122
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:37,820
To me, you are a colleague and mentor that I want to work with for the rest of my life.

123
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,990
Wow. My father is super awesome!

124
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,810
Of course, you don't know how great of a person he is.

125
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,200
Therefore, I can't accept this resignation letter.

126
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,520
So I ask that you tear up this letter with your own hands, please.

127
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,750
I have a condition.

128
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,900
Yes, please tell me.

129
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,760
For as long as you date my younger sister, I ask that you keep your work life apart from our private lives.

130
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,660
I also think the same.

131
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,210
Although you are my chairman at the company,

132
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,010
outside of the company

133
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,510
can I treat you like my younger sister's boyfriend?

134
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,640
Yes. Make sure to do that, please.

135
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,580
I got it, Min Kyu.

136
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,150
Yes, Hyungnim.

137
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,720
I'm telling you, there's nothing much in my room.

138
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,390
   

139
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,940
   

140
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,750
♫  You are the reason  ♫

141
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,400
♫  Why the world shines  ♫

142
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,770
♫   My heart was so dark   ♫

143
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,240
♫  But you became  ♫

144
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,510
♫  My light  ♫

145
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,310
♫  It was one long dream   ♫

146
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,510
♫  Before I met you,   ♫

147
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,100
♫  No one has ever given me  ♫

148
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,870
♫   The world's greatest happiness  ♫

149
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,980
♫   Words that even if I say it a thousand of times  ♫

150
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,710
♫  Words that are not enough even if I say it a million times  ♫

151
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,320
- Gosh, what should I do? 
 - What?

152
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,810
I'm liking you more and more.

153
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,660
♫  Warm words  ♫

154
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,520
- I have all of these.
 - What?

155
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,090
I have everything you made in the yellow cabinet at my house.

156
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,180
Liar.

157
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,790
Huh? You can check later when you come.

158
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,470
- Do you have the cleaning suit, too? 
- Yeah.

159
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,070
No way!

160
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,980
So out of the five people who bought it, you're one of them?

161
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,010
I mean, where did you get it? I wasn't able to sell much of it.

162
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,810
Kiss me. Then I'll tell you.

163
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,780
Aunt! Something is wrong with Mom!

164
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,400
Wait for me. Did you see my wallet?

165
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,220
- Walk slowly. 
- Mom! Are you all right?

166
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,890
- Mom! 
 - Mom is okay.

167
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,110
Ask your aunt to dress you. And quickly,

168
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,360
- the car. 
 - Taxi. Taxi.

169
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,770
No, let's take my car.

170
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,880
Okay. Start the car.

171
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,040
Put on your clothes and quickly come outside, Dong Hyun!

172
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,620
Slowly. Slowly.

173
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,360
You're all right, Hong Joo. You'll be all right.

174
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,580
This is our second child.

175
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,780
Don't be nervous.

176
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,710
It's okay. Dad, look at me.

177
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,450
I grew up well.

178
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,730
Oh, okay.

179
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,820
Hold onto your mom's hand.

180
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,570
Hold her hands.

181
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,540
Hong Joo's fine and the baby's healthy.

182
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,030
My daughter is really beautiful.

183
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,010
She's really a princess.

184
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,890
Our Dong Hyun is a big sister now.

185
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,290
Wow, she's really beautiful.

186
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,950
Doesn't she look like an angel?

187
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,800
Dong Hyun, she's your sister.

188
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,060
Welcome. This is your first time in the world, right?

189
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,990
   

190
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,980
We long to be connected with things and want to come in contact with people.

191
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,250
It is due to our instinct built into our DNA since the birth of human beings.

192
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:22,100
We, the Santa Maria Team, focused on that instinct while developing our new AI robot.

193
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,640
If it's possible to have an AI robot that can communicate emotionally,

194
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,710
how will the lives we live change?

195
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,900
To people who are physically and mentally tired,

196
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,660
if inputted and created emotions of robots become comfort,

197
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,730
what would that mean?

198
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:47,220
With all certainty, I can say that I believe this can help us become more human-like.

199
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,030
That connection that flows from one human to another.

200
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,520
If we could solve the secret behind emotional connections,

201
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,620
I concluded that we could create a revolutionary AI robot.

202
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,530
And in the end, the Santa Maria Team succeeded in solving a part of this secret.

203
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,970
We named that new robot after Daeyang Shipbuilding's late-Chairman Park Sung Jin.

204
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:25,230
Everyone, let me introduce you to the robot that will rewrite the history of android robots.

205
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,310
Hi, Jin.

206
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,660
   

207
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,060
Okay, I'll head out now.

208
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,780
Should we prepare this like that?

209
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,900
Yes. How about we research more over the weekend and hold another meeting on Monday morning?

210
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,590
- Yes, I understand. 
 - Okay.

211
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,770
Then, I'm going to head out first.

212
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,330
♫  Be brave and take a step closer  ♫

213
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,760
♫  That the weather is nice  ♫

214
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,520
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

215
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,810
If we leave now, we will get there without being late. Right?

216
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,310
Yeah, I think we should get there on time.

217
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,040
♫  You'll just be alone at home  ♫

218
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,700
♫  This moment that will never come again  ♫

219
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,130
- I got the diapers. 
- Honey. Honey.

220
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,020
- She just woke up so she will cry. 
- Aigoo. Aigoo.

221
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,310
- Here, take her.
- You just woke up? Aigoo. Aigoo.

222
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,660
Aigoo. We're late. We're running late.

223
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,200
We don't have enough time. Let's hurry up.

224
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,370
♫  A red rose although it may be a bit early  ♫

225
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,640
♫  Let's call it love story  ♫

226
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,910
♫  Even your name looks pretty  ♫

227
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,420
♫  Let's call it love story  ♫

228
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,910
♫  No one knows when love will come  ♫

229
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,080
Yeah, Honey? I'm almost there. I can see the building now.

230
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,130
I'll be right there. Okay.

231
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,090
♫  A moment ago, in front of me  ♫

232
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,730
♫  Just now, next to me  ♫

233
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,810
♫  Where are you now?  ♫

234
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,600
People can choose their own designs.

235
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,210
Would you be able to provide engraving service as well?

236
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,230
Sure.

237
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,220
The color. Can it also be an option?

238
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,580
I haven't thought about it yet, but that could also be possible.

239
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,220
Okay, so you can send us the samples by the end of the month

240
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,090
and the rest in two weeks, right?

241
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,210
Yeah, no problem.

242
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,970
We might be able to give a demonstration before the shipment arrives?

243
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,760
Maybe ensure a few distribution channels?

244
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,510
That would be wonderful.

245
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,590
Oh! How about using social media to release it to the public?

246
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,450
Since its function is based on networking,

247
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,960
I think it could appeal to a lot of the social media users.

248
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,680
Sure. That's a good idea.

I really... missed you.

258
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,860
Congratulations on your discharge. You worked hard.

259
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,180
This day does actually come in the end.

260
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,390
Aren't you hungry?

261
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm really hungry.

262
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,140
Let's go. Everyone's waiting for you.

263
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,990
I have so much to tell you.

264
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,200
- What is it?
 - Today, I signed a contract with an overseas buyer and I'm so happy!

265
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,220
I also thought of a new idea recently. What that is—

266
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,370
You should kiss

267
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,570
at this moment.
