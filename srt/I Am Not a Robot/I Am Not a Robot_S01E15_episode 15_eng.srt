If you had hoped

2
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,780
that the robot was a human,

3
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,370
fold a finger.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,200
♫  Someone like me  ♫

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  Can someone like me do it?  ♫

6
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:54,450
♫  I really am jealous  ♫

7
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:04,090
♫  I am afraid of getting hurt more so I backstep  ♫

8
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm not a robot.

11
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,400
It feels like we got played by Sun Hye.

12
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,010
Sorry about that. It's all because she doesn't like me at all.

13
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,890
She is the only soulmate that Jo Ji Ah has.

14
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,480
Seeing Sun Hye's reactions, I must have really wronged Ji Ah.

15
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,350
It really feels like I'm in a one-sided love these days.

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,090
But we still came this far.

17
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,630
It's all thanks to you guys.

18
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,860
If only I didn't send that threatening mail to MIT at the time, then you wouldn't have gone through all that.

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,870
If you are sorry then you should hurry up and fix AG-3.

20
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,300
Okay.

21
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,310
The moon is so bright.

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,220
It's just a crescent moon though.

23
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,430
But why are you touching his ears?

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,320
This is the only way I can make him sleep. Sleep, sleep.

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,820
I think there is a problem with the pressure sensor.

26
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,660
I guess we just have to stabilize it.

27
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,120
Oh, it's moving. So is it all fixed now?

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,750
It needs time to stabilize. It also needs to synchronize with you as well.

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,370
Stabilize? And synchronize?

30
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,520
What that means is... AG-3, pick up the cup.

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,050
As you can see, the system hasn't stabilized yet.

32
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,270
It looks like the data you received for AG-3's deep learning has collided with AG-3's main system.

33
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,440
But Kim Min Kyu shouldn't find out that you and AG-3 were switched. If she's like this, we'd get caught right away.

34
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,780
I understand.

35
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,300
In three days you and AG-3 will be switched and the test will be over in no time.

36
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,660
And when that time comes, I will tell Kim Min Kyu everything as is.

37
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,260
Until then, you must make sure not to get caught for being a human.

38
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,060
This particular test result is very important to Kim Min Kyu, too.

39
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,900
Three days? Okay, fine. I will wait.

40
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,650
Oh, yeah. I have a favor to ask you.

41
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,150
Do you think you can allow me to come to work late in the evening tomorrow?

42
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,220
I have something to take care of during the day.

43
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,820
Sure.

44
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:02,130
Thank you for explaining everything to me in detail and taking away my curiosity.

45
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,450
I'm in Korea right now. It looks like I can finally meet AG-3.

46
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,560
I have an appointment in the afternoon, so would it be okay to stop by on the way?

47
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,310
You should come next time.

48
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,200
Why? Did something happen to the robot?

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,530
No, it's not that. Actually, something happened to me.

50
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,070
What sort of problem?

51
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,380
I was at ease since you haven't been asking for a sleeping pill prescription. Is there a different problem now?

52
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,660
The problem occurred unexpectedly and I am going to take care of it today.

53
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,630
All right, good luck with that then. Today's the day for your blood test, right? Send it right away.

54
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,460
Recently, he seemed happy that the robot liked him, yet...

55
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,270
I wonder if something happened within the last two days?

56
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,630
What should I say? What kind of expression should I have when I greet him?

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,610
Calm down. Calm down.

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,220
Master!

59
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,200
Where are you?

60
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,790
Master!

61
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,290
Go get changed. We are going out.

62
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,000
What should I change into?

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,780
Dress in something warm. We can't have your battery drain because of the cold weather.

64
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,390
   

65
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,240
That outfit won't do.

66
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,330
What's going on?

67
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,350
Could it be... a date?

68
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,560
From head to toe, as is.

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,110
Okay.

70
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,400
Carry that.

71
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,340
Let's go.

72
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,590
What the hell? He didn't even look at it. He didn't compliment how pretty I look either.

73
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,230
Why is he buying me all this if he's going to be like that?

74
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,010
Wait a minute. This way, please.

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,600
We will be bringing out the meal the way it was reserved.

76
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,600
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

77
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,280
I was the one that wanted to have a meal with you and Ri El.

78
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,190
I knew it.

79
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,260
But still. He should've let me know earlier so I could prepare myself emotionally.

80
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,690
How's the food?

81
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,740
It's very tasty. I'm quite fond of it actually.

82
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,620
I'm glad that the flavor suits you well.

83
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,920
It suits perfectly for me, too.

84
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,410
So, what is the important thing you want to tell us about?

85
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,210
Let's get engaged first.

86
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,440
I want to follow the right procedures for Ri El.

87
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,900
An engagement? I haven't even kissed you yet.

88
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,600
That's a good idea. Procedures are important.

89
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,540
- Dad. 
 - It's necessary for people to

90
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,820
officially recognize us as one.

91
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,170
That way, no one's going to make a vain effort.

92
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,910
I agree with you.

93
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,960
Hey, I'm the one getting married.

94
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,280
Can you listen to my opinions, too?

95
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,080
Let's eat.

96
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,460
Excuse me for a moment.

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,930
When have you started liking Ri El?

99
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,720
Fifteen years ago.

100
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,580
Ri El sent me a birthday card each year.

101
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,600
I really thank you for that.

102
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Cards? When did I ever—

103
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,020
She tends to be very affectionate.

104
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,640
Dad, what was all of that earlier?

105
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,310
Did you send Min Kyu cards using my name?

106
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,120
Why would you do that?

107
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,780
If I sent it, it's the same as you sending it.

108
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,560
Dad, you can leave first.

109
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,710
I'm going to tell Min Kyu the truth.

110
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,410
Min Kyu said thank you.

111
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,630
If you tell him the truth,

112
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,420
it'll hurt Min Kyu a lot.

113
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,740
So annoying.

114
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,340
Oh, what's that girl doing?

115
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,360
It's hard to get an appointment here, and she came by herself. How mannerless.

116
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,930
Wasting money like that.

117
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,200
Get up. Let's go.

118
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,700
Are you okay?

119
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,280
About what?

120
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,970
You can't eat food that others make.

121
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,710
- So, earlier... 
 - Are you really worrying

122
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,880
or is it just dialogue cued by input?

123
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,410
Why did you bring me out today?

124
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,070
You had to be there.

125
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,110
Do you remember what you said last night?

126
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,910
I said that I wished you were human.

127
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,530
I remember all of what I said.

128
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,680
So? What does it mean to you?

129
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,560
Why?

130
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,140
Will you marry me instead?

131
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,790
If what I said bothers you, erase it just like last time.

132
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,870
It doesn't matter to me whether you remember it or not.

133
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,390
You're really not a good person.

134
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,790
I told you I'd reset you if friend mode appeared!

135
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,170
Reset me, then!

136
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,180
But I'm going to have to say what I need to say. Why are you doing this to me?

137
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,920
That's what I want to ask. Why are you doing this to me?

138
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,570
You're just a robot, yet why are you making me look after your feelings?

139
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,670
Why are you making me curious about your thoughts?

140
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,530
To you, who does not have feelings or thoughts. Why?!

141
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,420
Make a list of dresses

142
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,610
for Ri El to wear.

143
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,470
That is what a robot like you should do.

144
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,550
What's wrong with your face?

145
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,480
It's nothing.

146
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,710
Did something happen with Kim Min Kyu?

147
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,820
No, not really.

148
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,090
What did that punk do this time?

149
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,380
  When I said I wanted you to be human. 

150
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,540
  So? What does it mean to you? 

151
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,500
 Why? 

152
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,520
  Will you marry me instead?

What the heck? It looks uselessly real.

190
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,700
Get out.

191
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,320
I don't have AG-3. Just stand there and tell me.

192
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,970
You've gotten a lot better. Get out.

193
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,450
I need to talk to you face to face.

194
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,590
What do you want to say?

195
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,800
I asked you to not use her carelessly before.

196
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,060
Not use her carelessly?

197
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:07,380
You're talking as if someone hurt the robot.

198
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,100
The robot's existence is special to me.

199
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,490
Isn't that the same for you?

200
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,910
You said the robot's existence cured your illness.

201
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,600
The robot doesn't even have emotions.

202
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
She is a robot that you're supposed to train.

203
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,610
You have to spend time and effort.

204
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,350
So what?

205
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,320
Did the robot form emotions?

206
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,680
The robot cannot.

207
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,490
In the end, it's nothing.

208
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,320
How is it nothing?

209
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,240
Are the times you spent together nothing?

210
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,350
Every action you took became a part of her.

211
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,470
How is that nothing?

212
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,040
If it isn't nothing,

213
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,360
then delete it.

214
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,440
It's that easy.

215
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,810
Hey, Kim Min Kyu.

216
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,520
It's not like he's going through puberty, so what's wrong with him?

217
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,810
A moment, please.

218
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,540
Ssanip ate food that was Jo Ji Ah's.

219
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,200
I witnessed her giving him all of her food to eat.

220
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Repenting about how we must have underestimated Jo Ji Ah a little too much,

221
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,750
I, therefore, analyzed her data.

222
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,640
The reason why Jo Ji Ah started this part-time job is money.

223
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,710
But what's the reason for her to restart the part-time job even though she wouldn't get paid?

224
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,350
She said she was uncomfortable with getting too much money.

225
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,930
If we translate that liberally, doesn't it mean I've been on her mind?

226
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,860
Could that really be it?

227
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,980
At this moment in time, there is a need for us to analyze the items in her suitcase.

228
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,620
Her suitcase was for lodging and food. However, why did she bring two of the same heart lamps?

229
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,490
Why did she demand lodging and food here?

230
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Because of me?

231
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,780
You are just a constant.

232
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,300
However, at times like these, a variable may control the situation.

233
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,860
Not too long ago, KM Financial hosted a competition for young entrepreneurs.

234
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,860
I found out that her heart lamps made it to the final rounds.

235
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,390
The heart lamp's prototype

236
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,510
made it to second rounds four years ago in an idea competition among college students.

237
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,110
I was able to find that out after looking it up online.

238
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,390
Jo Ji Ah treats these lamps as if they are artifacts.

239
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,160
Although you were unable to recognize these lamps, you fixed these for her.

240
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,620
This is the only thing that connects the past and the present.

241
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:49,570
I've deducted that these heart lamps could be your broken part that needs to be fixed.

242
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,170
Wow, it's really swollen. Does it itch a lot? Do you have a runny nose?

243
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,610
I'm okay. Relax, Aunt.

244
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,770
I'm sorry. My stomach was cramping up.

245
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,470
Little one, don't make it hard for your mom.

246
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,540
You don't have to go to the hospital?

247
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,460
They said that as long as I don't overexert myself, it's okay.

248
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,620
But... Dong Hyun has to go the hospital.

249
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,180
Did you eat yet?

250
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,580
That looks good.

251
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,190
Wow, that looks good.

252
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,000
This reminds me of the past.

253
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,130
At the picnic, the kids saw that you brought rice balls and made fun of you.

254
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:46,500
I thought my rice balls were quite delicious, but when I saw that no one wanted to eat them I was a little sad.

255
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,770
I know, right? Considering the fact that an elementary school student made them, those were really tasty.

256
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,800
It's good, right?

257
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,150
 I made a special appointment at a university hospital for her. 

258
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,850
  I found a doctor who's the best at treating allergies. 

259
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,600
 Since it's her first time there, please explain well in my stead. 

260
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,920
Dong Hyun, these patches would've been itchy but you did well enduring them.

261
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,190
It's not only peanuts, but it's also green grapes, egg whites, and tomatoes.

262
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,660
She even got an allergic reaction to ticks.

263
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,440
- Could you scan her?
- Yes.

264
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,660
Let's go.

265
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,430
Besides her allergies, her oxygen saturation level is low, so I'll prescribe you some medicine.

266
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,720
It's gotten worse recently so it's been worrisome.

267
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,000
This isn't very likely, but there could be an emergency, so I'll also prescribe you some epinephrine.

268
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,530
Can I ask a question?

269
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:57,050
I know this situation doesn't make sense and sounds very odd, but

270
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:04,340
by any chance, is there an allergy where you can't come into contact with other people?

271
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,640
 There are only a few cases in the world, but that type of allergy does exist. 

272
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,030
 However, the problem is that due to its psychological cause, it's very hard to treat. 

273
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,260
Why? Do you know someone who's like that?

274
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:30,720
No, no. How do you treat someone with a human allergy?

275
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,250
There has been a case where someone got better when he found someone he could fully trust.

276
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,550
The human mind is quite mysterious, right?

277
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,570
There really is an allergy like that.

278
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,890
Then does Kim Min Kyu have an allergy to human contact?

279
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:54,900
But I'm a person. I've seen him come into contact with people.

280
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,570
It doesn't make sense.

281
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,740
Since our Dong Hyun went to the hospital, here's a gift.

282
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,080
I have to go to the market. Hong Joo wants me to pick up some things.

283
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,520
Dong Hyun, Auntie will be back quickly.

284
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,720
Bring snacks when you come.

285
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,000
It's a secret from your mom.

286
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,860
Dong Hyun, I'm going to the bathroom and it will take a little bit of time. If someone comes in...

287
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,570
Got it. I'll hold onto them so they don't leave.

288
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,490
You got it, little Dong Hyun.

289
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,990
It's peanuts for me.

290
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,170
What?

291
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:24,240
I have a peanut allergy. What about you?

292
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,380
It's a stronger allergy than yours.

293
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,520
I have an allergy to ticks, eggs, and tomatoes.

294
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,160
I just have one. But it's really severe.

295
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,410
I'm Dong Hyun.

296
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,550
- What? 
 - Dong Hyun. Jo Dong Hyun.

297
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,350
My name. What's your name?

298
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,950
Kim Min Kyu.

299
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,540
My aunt doesn't have a boyfriend.

300
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,860
What does that have to do with me?

301
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,610
This is what my aunt made.

302
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,760
You want me to eat it?

303
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,910
It's mine.

304
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,500
When my aunt was around my age, she went on a picnic.

305
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,240
But she didn't know how to make kimbap, so she made rice balls

306
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,160
like this. That was the first time she made them.

307
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,410
Why would a kid make kimbap?

308
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:33,360
She said there was no one to make it for her. This is really good.

309
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,630
She must've been teased a lot by others. Your aunt, I mean.

310
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,520
No one ate the rice balls with her. But my mom did.

311
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,350
So my aunt became my mom's guardian angel.

312
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,050
Kim Min Kyu?

313
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,130
Thanks to your help, I'm getting engaged.

314
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,080
Does the person who stole your first kiss know about this?

315
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,460
Yes, she does. She was right next to me.

316
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,430
You bastard.

317
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,200
Pardon?

318
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,410
No, just a little bit ago a bastard walked past.

319
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,340
You idiot.

320
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,860
You must've not come here just to tell me that, right?

321
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:43,160
You said that the girl and I were flirting, right?

322
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:49,890
Sun Hye, from your viewpoint, did she appear to have an interest in me?

323
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,630
Yes, a lot.

324
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,550
What made you come to that conclusion?

325
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,250
I see you.

326
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,530
   

327
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,060
 That salted sea squirt is for our Masan native...
 

328
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,120
 Researcher 1. 

329
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,890
She always stared at you.

330
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,790
Where the eyes go is where the heart goes.

331
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:34,360
Heart. That is a baseless reasoning.

332
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,260
How can we check something that we can't see?

333
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,560
What someone feels is what's most true. That'll be all.

334
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,250
If I say anymore, I feel like I'll start punching things.

335
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,360
Do you have any plans for accepting her feelings?

336
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,400
No matter how her appearance might change?

337
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,400
