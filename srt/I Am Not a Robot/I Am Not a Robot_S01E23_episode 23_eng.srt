1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,740
Hey—

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,900
Oh. Wait.
    

3
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,300
There's someone in here! Hey!

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,040
There's someone in here!

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,610
Hey! There's someone in here!

6
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,370
Hey!

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,130
 Did I just get locked up in the storage room alone with him? 

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,130
 This can't be. 

9
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,720
 I'll either die from suffocation or the cold by tomorrow. 

10
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,750
Ah. Well, don't worry, Customer. Just trust me.

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,700
I'll make sure you can get out of here no matter what.

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,220
 If we can't get out, I will go crazy.  

13
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,600
If I call, someone will come right away. Just a moment.

14
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,910
There's no reception.

15
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,520
Come on.

16
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,420
Work.

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,800
Work.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,240
Please.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,210
No service.

20
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,910
Don't worry. I have experience with being homeless.

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,840
Just trust me.

22
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:03,970
Oh, so this. Once we turn on the headlights, they will know someone is in here.

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,650
So for sure, someone outside --

24
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,170
Don't be scared.

25
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,480
I have great night vision.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,710
I will definitely not allow you to be locked up here until tomorrow morning.

27
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,350
Well, it's all right.

28
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,490
I'm used to being locked up.

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,930
And I'm used to being cold, too.

30
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,060
 You're nuts!  

31
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,450
 Blow the double trumpets, why don't you!  

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,180
I guess your stomach is complaining.

33
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,620
You did eat a lot of sashimi earlier.

34
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,670
It wasn't me though.

35
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,030
Then, would it be me?

36
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,950
So it was me.

37
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,450
I skipped lunch and dinner, too.

38
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,700
 Your call cannot be connected and you will be transferred to the voicemail box. 

39
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,820
Ji Ah isn't answering and Kim Min Kyu's cellphone can't be connected.

40
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,930
It's roadblock after roadblock.

41
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,370
It's cold out so you go inside.

42
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,550
I'm all right.

43
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,750
I will help you fix it together.

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,460
You'll catch a cold, kid.

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,670
I'm fine.

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,180
Listen to me already.

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,390
If you're by my side, I can't do this out of worrying, so go inside.

48
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,620
It's because you're tired.

49
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,150
Go into the car and rest up a bit first then.

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,530
We don't have the time.

51
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,830
No one's going to die even if we rest briefly first before we go.

52
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,890
But if you don't rest now and drive later, we may die.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,150
Go inside.

54
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:04,320


55
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:25,230
First, let's try to find something that can help us deal with the cold before someone can come.

56
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,730
I think we should be able to find something to lie on or cover ourselves with around here.

57
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,240
Okay.

58
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,590
Oh, I found it!

59
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,950
This is thick enough and there's a lot of it.

60
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,130
I don't think we will freeze to death.

61
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,960
Wait. You mean to take that and cover us with it?

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,420
We can lay out the hay and pull the burlap over us.

63
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,890
It works somewhat enough like a blanket.

64
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,680
- Customer, you hold on and wait a bit while I set it up. 
 - Okay.

65
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,060
Here we go.

66
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,850
-  Ah! 
 - Let me see.

67
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,700
Oh.

68
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,470
What are you doing? Let go. I'm fine.

69
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,030
You really did get a splinter.

70
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,630
I did.

71
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,020
It might go in deeper if you do that.

72
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,600
Why the card?

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,560
There we go.

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
It came out.

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,750
Are you all right?

76
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,410
About what?

77
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,560
You wanted to restart with Ji Ah.

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,620
When you found out Kim Min Kyu and Ji Ah liked each other,

79
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,140
what thought occurred to you?

80
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,880
When Kim Min Kyu failed in trying to redo the deep learning training on AG-3,

81
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,110
I felt what he would have felt then.

82
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,690
Now I can never find that Jo Ji Ah from back then again.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,990
The one who always smiled for me no matter what I said.

84
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,190
The woman who always cheered me on.

85
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,360
She's gone forever now.

86
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,580
I realized why we broke up,

87
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,450
so I wanted to redeem the past mistakes.

88
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,950
But Ji Ah is no longer the same Ji Ah as then.

89
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,840
And I'm not the me from back then either.

90
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:35,020
Something that you can't undo. Irreversibility.

91
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,320
So it's a sad tale.

92
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,990
Don't you ache?

93
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,790
I do ache. I ache.

94
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:58,520
But compared to the pain of those two, it's not even close.

95
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,930
♫  Standing here  ♫

96
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,870
♫  Constantly staying by your side  ♫

97
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,200
It's nice.

98
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,950
♫  Standing here   ♫

99
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,880
Let's rest a bit more until the song's over.

100
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,330
♫  Foolish person  ♫

101
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,040
♫  Only if you turn your head  ♫

102
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,560
♫  You would see me  ♫

103
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,050
♫  Why don't you know?  ♫

104
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,750
♫  Then you shouldn't have smiled like that to me  ♫

105
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,410
Go on up. It's where you will sleep tonight.

106
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,880
What about you, Hong Joo? There's only one.

107
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,090
Well, I can just exercise.

108
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,720
At this nighttime hour, you'll exercise?

109
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,680
 Then do you mean for us to lie down there together?  

110
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,280
 So I can die from a bursting heart?  

111
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,500
Exercise is perfect for warming up the body on a cold day.

112
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,340
I'll stay up all night.

113
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,630
So, Customer, you go on up and rest.

114
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,410
Hong Joo, please come over here.

115
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,340
Oh, it's a heater.

116
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,430
I guess we won't freeze to death.

117
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,060
And also...

118
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,990
Anchovies and rice wine and instant noodles.

119
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,250
This is really excellent.

120
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,520
But what if this belongs to someone?

121
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,670
Can we really eat it?

122
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,560
We can just eat it and refill it.

123
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,990
Then, should we just have a taste?

124
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,210
Here you go.

125
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,470
From the sound I heard earlier, even if you eat everything in here,

126
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,750
it still might be not enough.

127
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:39,360


128
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,880
Would you stop staring at me?

129
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,650
It's so amazing, that's why.

130
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,850
Are you amazed because I look like her?

131
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,790
Nope.

132
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,720
What are you amazed about then?

133
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,820
You say that you're cold and hungry.

134
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,800
We're eating instant noodles and also drinking alcohol together.

135
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,700
All the things that I wanted to hear and see from AG-3,

136
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,980
you're doing them right now, Hong Joo.

137
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,460
Of course, since I'm a human after all.

138
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,850
By the way, how old are you? I'm 28, I mean I am now 29 years old.

139
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,640
We are the same age then.

140
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,130
Same age?

141
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,160
Yeah, we are the same age.

142
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Oh, do you want to be friends with me then?

143
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,070
No, I don't want to.

144
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,510
Why not?

145
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,980
Would you want to if you were me?!

146
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,960
By the way, why aren't you asking me what my name is?

147
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,750
I know your name, Hong Joo.

148
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,110
I'm not interested in what your name is.

149
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,590
It's Kim Min Kyu. It's not you or Customer.

150
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,290
It's Kim Min Kyu.

151
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,190
Well...

152
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,380
If you are not going to drink that rice wine, then I will drink it.

153
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,990
So why did you have to follow me and get trapped?

154
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,270
I kind of like it.

155
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,520
Like what?

156
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,780
Just this situation that we are in. All of it.

157
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,920
What you just said now

158
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,330
will be misunderstood by your girlfriend if she heard it, don't you know that?

159
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,170
I don't have a girlfriend.

160
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,140
By the way, this rice wine tastes really good.

161
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,100
Oh, the headlight just went out.

162
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:45,260


163
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,650
Is it raining outside?

164
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,690
It's the sound of the waves. The wind is blowing, too.

165
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,970
It sounds just like the rain falling.

166
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,410
Do you like the rain?

167
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,400
It's because there is a memory that I can't forget.

168
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,620
I experienced my first kiss on a rainy day.

169
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,560
I...

170
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,250
would like to talk more about AG-3 with you, Hong Joo.

171
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,680
If you won't be offended by it,

172
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,410
will you listen to my stories?

173
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,930
I never had a proper chance to talk about her with anyone.

174
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,070
It's because what we shared together is

175
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,540
somewhat difficult to express in words in many ways.

176
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,830
So it's really hard for someone else to understand it.

177
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:50,710
But I would like to share this with you for some reason, Hong Joo.

178
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,650
If you don't want to, I won't.

179
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,310
If you promise that you won't bother me after tonight, then I will let you.

180
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,980
I truly feel uncomfortable to be involved with you, Mr. Kim Min Kyu.

181
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,980
I promise. But can you ask me about AG-3?

182
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,330
Now that I'm about to, I really don't know where to start.

183
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:41,350
When did AG-3 become something special to you?

184
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,280
I know that one, for sure.

185
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,810
It was from the first day she was delivered to me for some testing, that's when.

186
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,710
If you listen to my stories, you won't be able to sleep because you'll be filled with laughter. So hear me out.

187
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,810
She made me feel so dumbfounded in many ways from the very beginning.

188
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,540
The very first thing she said the moment she saw me was "Oh my! Oh my!!!"

189
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,060
And she's a robot for crying out loud. So I asked Doctor Hong about this

190
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,070
and he was saying something about friend mode and all that.

191
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,260
So I told him I understood and prepared some problems to solve.

192
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,690
I put an egg inside of this box.

193
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,430
This was supposed to be about solving a problem to unlock the box with the key.

194
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,570
But then she brought her fist down all of a sudden! The box actually broke, too.

195
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,360
Gosh that robot, how strong is it? But anyway, she was able to get the egg out of the box.

196
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,220
And there is something else.

197
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,630
I had this perfume in my hand but I stepped on soap and slipped.

198
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,380
Between me and the perfume, she went for the perfume.

199
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:36,370
 I wonder what would've happened if an honest confession was made back then? 

200
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,690
Sun Hye, how many times do I have to tell you?

201
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,960
If we really did that back then, then our brother could have died.

202
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,500
There was a probability that he wouldn't have died, too.

203
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,530
We can't figure out that percentage with our brain power.

204
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,700
I guess that's true.

205
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,240
It's because that's not the realm of head but the heart.

206
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,040
The realm of faith.

207
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,030
You believe here. That's right.

208
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:13,900
So basically, you didn't have faith that he would believe you even if you told him sincerely.

209
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,100
 Kim Min Kyu's love for Ji Ah 

210
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,160
 and Kim Min Kyu's affection towards the Santa Maria team. 

211
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,030
 You victimized yourselves and decided that they weren't enough for him to believe your confession, no? 

212
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,450
 However... 

213
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,450
 How will you prove that your decision was the right one to make? 

214
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,970
Even when a patient has a 99% death rate,

215
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,490
a doctor operates on that 1% hope.

216
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,890
And from time to time that 1% percent creates a miracle, too.

217
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,510
Yes, that 1%.

218
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,130
There's some truth to what you're saying, Sun Hye. And we...

219
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,490
The doctors can do such things.

220
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,460
The doctors are able to take a risk for that 1%, but when it comes to family,

221
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,980
we can't do that.

222
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,950
Into an operation that has a 99% death rate,

223
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,060
would you be able to send your parents?

224
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,900
Brother is a family member to us now.

225
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,030
He's so attractive the more I look at him.

226
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,700
Who is?

227
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,450
Me?

228
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,180
Hello, Doctor Oh.

229
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,020
Did you arrive?

230
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,610
Not yet, my car has broken down on my way over.

231
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,030
Darn it. Please contact me immediately regarding their situation once you arrive.

232
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,240
If by any chance Patient Kim Min Kyu has an attack, open his bag.

233
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,470
There is an epinephrine pre-filled syringe in case of emergencies.

234
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,780
I will never let that happen.

235
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,430
Of course, you shouldn't.

236
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,810
By looking at the case of Johnny, that particular syringe might not work if he has an attack again.

237
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,150
Please help me out.

238
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,650
Will do.

239
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,150
Where did she go?

240
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,970
Why didn't you wake me up?

241
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,430
Because you were deeply sleeping.

242
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,840
But you still should've woken me up, kid.

243
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,180
Let's hurry up and go, Doctor.

244
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,680
Wait up.

245
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,380
I'm fine. Let's just hurry up and go.

246
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,250
It will be fine. No one will die even if we take time to wipe your hand down first.

247
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,820
Sorry for not listening to you back then.

248
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,440
But I still don't regret staying by Kim Min Kyu's side.

249
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,050
You also did your best, Doctor.

250
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:11,400
I guess that will also be something you can't turn back, an irreversibility.

251
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:30,750
So after I reset AG-3 like that, it all came to an end.

252
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,160
Like a dummy.

253
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,020
That's the end.

254
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,830
Isn't it not... the end?

255
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,410
It is the end.

256
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,660
But that is...

257
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,960
How you've lived since the reset,

258
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,400
you have to tell me about that for it to be an ending. Why did you stop when you didn't even finish?

259
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,580
But that might be a bit boring though.

260
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,470
I'm the one who will decide whether it's interesting or boring.

261
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,260
Do your really want to hear it?

262
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:23,830
At first, I was really hurt. It was very difficult for me...

263
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,790
And after some time passed, I could breathe a bit again.

264
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:43,800
And I went to work like an ordinary person and ate meals at the dining hall like an ordinary person.

265
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,830
Got off work like an ordinary person.

266
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:54,040
Went to the theater alone to see a movie and went to the bookstore alone, too.

267
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,490
♫  Loving with all of your heart  ♫

268
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,720
♫  How and what kind of person can do it?  ♫

269
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Suppose that

270
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,550
AG-3 saw you right now.

271
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,680
♫  It really doesn't work out well   ♫

272
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,650
"You did so great."

273
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,490
She would say that and praise you.

274
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,190
Nope.

275
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,670
AG-3 would definitely say this.

276
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,260
 You worked hard. 

277
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,100
You worked hard.

278
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,490
♫  Loving with all your heart   ♫

279
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,520
See! I told you that this part is boring.

280
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,360
It's not that.

281
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,950
But why did you

282
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,670
say it was dumb to reset?

283
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,890
That's a secret.

284
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,600
You can't tell me?

285
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,810
If you will be my friend, I will tell you. Since it's bad to keep secrets between friends.

286
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,930
Will you? Be my friend?

287
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,630
But, Hong Joo, you are really cute.

288
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,180
I'm sorry.

289
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,740
If you're sorry then tell me.

290
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:13,240
I tried to go through deep learning with AG-3 after it was reset.

291
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:21,100
That friend that I trained. I wanted to find her again.

292
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,070
I said exactly the same things as I did the first time and behaved the same.

293
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,270
Pulling all-nighters to input one after another.

294
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:40,620
But that friend never showed up again.

295
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:51,390
When I think back, my heart did tell me, incessantly,

296
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,770
that everything I felt was real.

297
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,570
And I, who was scared and frightened, ignored that.

298
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:16,390
In the end, I was punished for it.

299
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:30,710
So now, in front of you, I'm rambling on like this.

300
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:47,220
 After time passes, could those two go back to how it was?  

301
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,610
If it is irrevocable now, it will still be the same after time passes.

302
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:58,490
For Min Kyu to trust Ji Ah's and our words 100% completely.

303
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:05,420
It's up to that but how could anyone explain this complicated and twisted situation?

304
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:11,670
Even if we explain it, who would believe it? Even I can't.

305
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,930
You got an offer to be a full-time professor, I saw.

306
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,160
Sorry. I saw the message unintentionally.

307
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm not interested.

308
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,270
Why aren't you interested in it? It's not just any position.

309
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,390
I like how it is now.

310
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,270
I hope you will accept that offer.

311
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,560
A full-time professorship is a future—

312
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,570
When it's time to leave, I will see to it that I leave without troubling you.

313
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,880
So for now, please just concentrate on driving.

314
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,370
So stubborn.

315
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,690
It's dawn.

316
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,590
Time really goes by fast.

317
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,220
I think I talked too much. You should talk about something, too.

318
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,520
Should I ask you? Who's in your family?

319
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,270
I have an older brother, a sister-in-law, a niece, and me.

320
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,530
And also a future baby number 2 who will be born.

321
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,600
So you live off of your brother?

322
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,420
I'm not talented with words.

323
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,160
That's true. That's not something so easily improved.

324
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,210
What?

325
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,250
Next question.

326
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,050
The person you want to see the most right now?

327
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,890
My ideal type who is also my life's mentor.

328
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,470
Who is that?

329
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,360
My dad who passed away.

330
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,850
When I was little, my dad ran a car repair shop.

331
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:15,620
I would go to the car repair shop after school and run around and play.

332
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,630
When the cars came all broken and wrinkled up,

333
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:24,300
my dad would fix them completely and made them run again.

334
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,980
Any flaws on a car would disappear after it went through my dad.

335
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,450
Like magic.

336
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:40,130
I wanted to become like my dad, too,

337
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,910
with something I am good at.

338
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,290
I can picture it clearly.

339
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,350
But what you imagine and what you're good at are different.

340
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,900
It seemed like all the luck went to others.

341
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,940
So at some point, you come to think that you are actually useless in this world.

342
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,340
I had thought so.

343
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,600
 How did someone think of this? 

344
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,410
 Maybe a genius? Or a master? 

345
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,260
 I want to meet the creator of this umbrella. 

346
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:42,820
One person gave me the feeling that I was actually really useful and I shouldn't give up.

347
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:52,220
I don't know who that is but if he heard what you just said, he would be proud.

348
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,360
Would he be?

349
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,450
The very fact that he became that kind of person to someone

350
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,730
is empowering on its own.

351
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,400
I see.

352
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:13,750
Next time you see that person, be sure to tell him.

353
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,060
I will do that.

354
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,670
Kim Min Kyu.

355
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:41,060
Now that you've said enough and I've heard enough,

356
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:50,390
as you promised, go up to Seoul now with a content heart.

357
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:06,460
After time passes, everything will be like, "Oh yeah, it was like that then."

358
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,290
They will remain as memories like that.

359
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:19,520
I wish you happiness, Kim Min Kyu.

360
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,460
Sincerely.

361
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:35,380
♫  Lingering right at the edge of my lips, over and over  ♫

362
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,520
♫  No matter how much I yell  ♫

363
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,840
♫  It doesn't seem like you can hear  ♫

364
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,250
♫  Everyday only with my eyes   ♫

365
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,490
What a shock!

366
00:31:53,490 --> 00:32:02,460
♫  I could say the words of love for you  ♫

367
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:02,500
