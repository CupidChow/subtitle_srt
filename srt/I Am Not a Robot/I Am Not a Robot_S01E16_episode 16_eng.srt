1
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,730
   

2
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,790
Coffee with a lot of syrup, please.

3
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm craving something sweet.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,830
Some poor guy came by just now.

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,650
That timing though.

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,810
That guy's getting engaged, right? He just came by.

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,690
He came all the way here to announce that?

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,390
So is confessing out of the question now?

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,470
  Do you have any plans for accepting her feelings? 

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,800
  No matter how her appearance might change?  

11
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,760
 No matter how I change in my looks, 

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,080
  I hope you can still recognize me. 

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,260
 What did you just say? 

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,310
 Let's get married. 

15
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,250
 I think that 

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,690
 you also have feelings towards me. 

17
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,320
 - Me? 
 - Yeah. Otherwise, why would you come here? 

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,040
 That's because you said it was urgent. 

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,700
 But still, you chose to come to another guy while you were on a date? 

20
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,610
 You're not a guy to me. You're just my friend. 

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,440
 For real, am I not considered as a guy to you? 

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,570
 Hey, I'm going to become your friend's wife. 

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,820
 Watch your manners. 

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,570
 I'm forgiving you because you seem drunk tonight. 

25
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,470
Since when were you here?

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm getting engaged to Min Kyu.

27
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,060
Let's all have a meal one day and hash things out. We still have to see each other.

28
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,870
Hello?

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,700
- I'm Jang Doo Sam. 
- Yes.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,180
Please let Chairman Kim Min Kyu know

31
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,190
that if he promises to put President Hwang in jail, I'll give all my recordings to him.

32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,850
All right, I'll give you a call later.

33
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,060
- Team Leader Jo.
 - Yes?

34
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,400
- Director Yoon. 
 - Glad I bumped into you. Come with me.

35
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,200
Okay.

36
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,680
What is it?

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,310
   

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,740
- Are you Team Leader Jo Jin Bae?
 - Yes.

39
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,310
Come sit.

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,540
Please help out CEO Hwang a lot.

41
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,630
I am well aware of what you do for Kim Min Kyu.

42
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,630
I'm not telling you to quit doing that.

43
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm just saying that whatever you gain knowledge of, I hope we know it first.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,880
Soon KM Financial is going to have

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,230
a company-wide reorganization.

46
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,090
The system where Kim Min Kyu acted as king

47
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,780
will become a story of the past.

48
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,630
Do you think he will side with us?

49
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,450
He doesn't need to.

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,090
As long as it isn't Min Kyu's side.

51
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,090
What will you do about Jang Doo Sam?

52
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,350
 The robot industry doesn't make a lot of money yet, so 

53
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,990
  Kim Min Kyu won't invest in it. 

54
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,250
 Why don't you sell that part to Britain's Bold Group? 

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,120
 I know Chairman Martin well. 

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,680
 I can persuade Chairman Kim Min Kyu, President Hwang. 

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,540
 Please give me some of your support. 

58
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,250
 Either way, I think you are quite impressive, Chairman Park. 

59
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,110
 How did you think to 

60
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,650
 hide this robot in secret as a part of the R&amp;D team? 

61
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,300
- More than anything, we need to find out about it before Kim Min Kyu does.
 - Yes.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,370
Ah, before that, what about AG-3?

63
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,430
Hey, just confess it.

64
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,060
It's a problem if a robot loves a person, but is it a problem when a person loves a person?

65
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,090
Honestly, you're not an alien or something.

66
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,620
Is Kim Min Kyu actually going to kill you

67
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,450
because you're not a real robot?

68
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,050
Hey, listen. I planned to confess everything after the test.

69
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,480
But he ignores me this much as a robot. Imagine him knowing that I'm a person.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,130
He's going to charge at me to kill me.

71
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,060
You should wear this for the presentation.

72
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,530
With this on, Jin Bae or whoever won't recognize you.

73
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,560
Even I would ignore you.

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,300
Man, this is cool.

75
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,830
I have to look really strong to not be discouraged there.

76
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,330
Yes. You're the crazy bitch here!

77
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,710
Go to KM Financial!

78
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,840
Let's go!

79
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,310
AG-3 ate what?

80
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,000
- Yes. An ice cream. 
 - But it's a robot.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,760
- I didn't see it, but he did.
 - She really ate it.

82
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,990
- For real, like this. 
 - So it's not a robot, but a person?

83
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,570
No. I'm sure it's a robot.

84
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,150
It's a robot but it ate an ice cream?

85
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,890
I stabbed it with this, and this stick broke

86
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,430
as if it hit an iron plate.

87
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,840
If it was a person, it would scream, bleed, and cause chaos.

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,260
But it didn't even flinch.

89
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,110
I think it's an extremely great robot, Uncle.

90
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,230
Since we had to determine whether it's a human or a robot,

91
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,520
we failed to kidnap it.

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,870
However, next time for sure—

93
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,220
Are you kidding me? What kind of excuse is that?

94
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,750
No really, it's a robot...

95
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,340
That Social Contribution Team Leader bastard.

96
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,590
He made these guys responsible for this and left?

97
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,560
How much money did you receive from the Social Contribution Team Leader?

98
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,010
30,000,000 won and an additional 30,000,000 won.

99
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,300
The remaining 40,000,000, Team Leader took...

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,420
Ah, seriously.

101
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,870
I'm giving you one more chance.

102
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,670
Make sure to bring AG-3 within three days. Understand?

103
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,010
Why? Is it not well-cooked?

104
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,910
Why are you being so nice to me these days? I can't get used to it.

105
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,630
- You don't like it? 
 - I'm not saying I don't like it.

106
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm just afraid what kind of job you will make me do next time.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,550
- You made the final rounds.
 - What?

108
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,320
KM Financial Competition for young entrepreneurs.

109
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm not taking your food. Eat slowly.

110
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,020
Chairman Kim Min Kyu's not the one judging. The social contribution team will be proceeding that.

111
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,110
And I'll be completely disguised so that even my brother can't recognize me.

112
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,430
You really don't have to worry.

113
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,290
If you had told me earlier, I could've helped you.

114
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,910
There's nothing for you to help with.

115
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,110
It was the same item that was submitted

116
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,630
four years ago, right? What happened then?

117
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,630
It's too early for you to ask me about that.

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,070
Of course, it got eliminated.

119
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,290
But this time, I'm really confident.

120
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,340
Someone said that I'm a genius.

121
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,430
What kind of crazy man said that?

122
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,430
He must be buttering you up to scam you.

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,570
You should've called me when you got eliminated from the contest.

124
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,820
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

125
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,350
I didn't pick up?

126
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,430
Then you should have come to school...

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,690
You did come.

128
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,920
By chance, is that the day we broke up?

129
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,180
   

130
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,650
 If you fight with your family members, 

131
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,970
 then you just go into your own rooms. 

132
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,680
 This can be used to express your apology then. 

133
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,340
 So, it can connect one's heart to another's. 

134
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,890
 Then what are our cell phones for? 

135
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,950
 Miss Jo, did you apply to build your resume? 

136
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,090
 I think we have to adjust the pelvic axis for the leg and construct it that way.
    

137
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,350
 Then wouldn't it become too thick and look strange? 

138
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,120
 If we don't adjust it, then I don't think the inverse kinematics won't be solvable. 

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,300
 The customer you called isn't available, so you will be connected to voicemail. 

140
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,540
 Are you in the lab? Did you pull an all-nighter again? 

141
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,530
 I'm missing you so much right now. 

142
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,180
 I'm heading over there so just show me your face for a bit. 

143
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,810
   

144
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,590
 If we just utilize this Jacobian algorithm, 

145
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,180
 the problem will be resolved. 

146
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,200
  What a nice atmosphere. It must be working out well. 

147
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,190
 I think there's going to be a good result soon. 

148
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,170
 I'll be looking forward to it. Oh, right. Ji Ah's here. 

149
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,060
 Oh really? 

150
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,050
 Is she asking you to make something again? 

151
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,030
 Don't help her too much so that she's not too hopeful. 

152
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,600
 I'm doing it because I like helping her. She never asked me for it. 

153
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,780
 Same thing. You're so slow-witted. 

154
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,450
 She's my girlfriend. Watch your manners. 

155
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,910
 - What are you doing here? 
 - You're here. 

156
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,060
 Why are you doing something that I didn't ask you to do? Please think before you act. 

157
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,410
 Did someone ask you to clean up? Are you a cleaner? 

158
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,060
♫  Living as you hoped  ♫

159
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,310
 Ji Ah, I found a new route to solving a search algorithm. 

160
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,260
 You mean that thing you've been researching night and day? How? 

161
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,420
 The main point of communication between a robot and a person is to understand the pattern. 

162
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,830
 How fast and accurately it categorizes a person's mind and feelings into a pattern. That's the key point. 

163
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,080
 The expanded data that is essentially in 3-dimensions will be quickly stacked into groups in parallel worlds; thereby, creating a pattern 

164
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,050
 while securing both great speed and accuracy. 

165
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,760
 You didn't understand, right? 

166
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,040
 Yes, but I know that it's something great. 

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,560
 I'll make a robot that's capable of communicating emotions! 

168
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,380
 Congratulations!! 

169
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,490
 MIT is asking for me to come as soon as possible. 

170
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,460
 Then, are you heading to America? 

171
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,170
 Yes. You have to learn English from now on. 

172
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,580
 I'm also going? 

173
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,480
 Of course! Come to America with me and do whatever you want. 

174
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,800
 Don't waste time doing something that doesn't work. 

175
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,920
 What do you mean by that? 

176
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,450
 You said you're tired. Don't do it if you feel tired by it. 

177
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,460
 But you do it even if you're tired. 

178
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,630
 Are you the same as me? 

179
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,720
♫  That kind of love  ♫

180
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,910
 Let's break up. 

181
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,000
♫  I'm really jealous  ♫

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,310
 Let's not see each other ever again. 

183
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:59,650
♫  Like you before, I want to love like that  ♫

184
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,710
Before Chairman Park Seong Jin died, he met President Hwang Do Won.

185
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,420
And there's a recording of that night's conversation?

186
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,360
Yes. President Hwang had definitely previously known that Santa Maria was a robot development team.

187
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,890
You know what that implies, right?

188
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,050
It's proof that President Hwang intentionally sold Daeyang Shipbuilding at the lowest price.

189
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,630
We can't legally charge him with the recording as evidence, but it's reason enough to have him dismissed from the board of directors.

190
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,170
CEO Hwang won't be able to avoid punishment since he headed the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

191
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,930
There's no way they wouldn't have stolen a part of that tremendous amount of money in the sales process.

192
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,330
I think the same. The rebate amount would be tremendous.

193
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,890
It's similar to Yoosung Group's rebate incident where they got paid for omission of information.

194
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,120
As Jang Doo Sam wanted, give him my contact information.

195
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,610
In order to protect Santa Maria, we have to get our hands on the recording

196
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,420
before those people realize there's a recording in existence.

197
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,950
And I will give you all my ID and passwords that grant full access to all of KM Financial's information,

198
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,490
so secure additional proof. We don't have time.

199
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,600
Okay, got it.

200
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,490
Then what time should I prepare for you to head into the office tomorrow?

201
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,530
Head into the office?

202
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,770
I thought you were taking part in the final evaluation for the young entrepreneur competition.

203
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,660
That is under the Social Contributions team.

204
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,460
Oh, okay.

205
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you all this time.

206
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:58,220
A bonus... When this work is finished, I'll give you 100%.

207
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,190
300%.

208
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,460
200%. That's it.

209
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,030
Got it.

210
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,260
The moon was bright? A crescent moon was so bright, huh?

211
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,580
I know, right? It was a crescent moon, but strangely, it was bright.

212
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,160
Where did you two go without me?

213
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,200
We didn't go anywhere.

214
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,290
I saw it all.

215
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,810
I was cold but you left me on the bench and went away by yourselves. I saw.

216
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,960
No, we didn't.

217
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,330
Don't imagine anything. Did you guys, by any chance, kiss?

218
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,720
Kiss? Sun Hye wanted to go to the bathroom so I walked her. That's all.

219
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,350
Hyung, you're scaring me. Stop it.

220
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,690
I find you scarier when you're like that. Please stop. Let's go in.

221
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,490
Oh, and pay for today's coffee.

222
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,680
It's cold.

223
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,050
Why do I have to keep buying it when you keep doing bad things?

224
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,990
You must find the coffee here really good.

225
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,650
It's cheap.

226
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,100
It's really good to me.

227
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,460
It lacks a bit of flavor for me.

228
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,790
Do you know that coffee and dating are really similar?

229
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,700
You have to collect many different beans, roast them, taste them.

230
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,420
You're searching for the moment when the coffee tastes perfect for you. That's exactly what dating is like.

231
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:38,390
Yeah, that's right. Searching for someone who's perfect for me.

232
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,790
That's what dating is. You're right.

233
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,130
It's not easy to find something that perfectly suits your taste.

234
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,830
If it doesn't suit your taste, then why do you come here?

235
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,300
Because the price is cheap.

236
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,510
This guy, he's strangely playing hard to get.

237
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,700
- Pardon me? 
 - Pardon?

238
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,090
- What did you just say? 
 - Include me, too. What?

239
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,140
Last time, she mumbled something, too.

240
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,670
Oh, you arrived?

241
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,980
Help me.

242
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,950
I know that I've made a lot of mistakes, so help me.

243
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,690
Where's the electricity?

244
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,730
This doesn't work either.

245
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,580
- Why doesn't it work? 
- What's going on?

246
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,290
Surprise!

247
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,970
You should've told us earlier. See? We can help you like this.

248
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,730
Get first place and while you're at it, get second, too!
   

249
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,220
You promised. Four insurances and a bonus.
   

250
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,840
What's all of this? You guys, sorry. And thank you.

251
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,170
I heard that the final screening is held like a free market. Then having fun is the main focus.

252
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,290
Think of us as your judges and explain freely.

253
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,170
Dear, are you there?

254
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,270
Yes, I am here!

255
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,180
Like that, no matter how far apart they are in this world, these two are connected.

256
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,530
Is there something wrong?

257
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,090
By any chance, did you study quantum physics or know anything about quantum?

258
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,780
What's that?

259
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,760
Quantum entanglement.

260
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,130
It's a theory where two particles that are far apart are still connected,

261
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,820
so if one particle makes an action, it will affect the other particle.

262
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,940
It means that no matter how far apart they are in this world, they're connected.

263
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,710
Wow, that's so amazing.

264
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,700
Yeah, that's amazing. We studied until our brains exploded, but how do you know about it just like that?

265
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,980
We have a true genius right here.

266
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,960
Then do I have the right to be a part of this genius group now?

267
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,740
I'll let you in. Also, later in the future, give me one. I want one.

268
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,550
Who are you going to give it to? Tell me your heart.

269
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,920
It's for my mom.

270
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,180
Let's keep practicing.

  "One person is enough."

 If you have one person, you can endure through things without breaking.

  We hope to become that person for someone. 

287

This is only the beginning. Are you all right?

298
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,700
I can feel it. It's kicking.

299
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,600
You can feel it?

300

♫  I could say the words of love for you  ♫

305
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,260
Why isn't he picking up? Did something really happen?

306
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,750
His blood levels are really good. He would be really amazed if he saw.

307

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,780
You came here early.

311
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,080
Hello!

312
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,560
The situation was really crazy, so I wasn't able to say it then. I'm really thankful, Jo Ji Ah.

313
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,580
Being able to come here is thanks to you.

314
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,410
That's right.

315
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,380
- Really. 
- Thank you!

316
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,270
Not at all, I only grabbed their attention. We did all the hard work together.

317
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,460
Let's all do our best and whoever wins, let's applaud wholeheartedly.

318
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,230
Yes.

319
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,120
Good luck!

320
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,960
Did you call for me?

321
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,680
Change the supervisor of today's competition to the CEO.

322
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,740
What is the reason that CEO Hwang is taking part in this?

323
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,500
It is him trying to support you.

324
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,220
If a competition gets supervised by the CEO, then the person in charge will get a good evaluation.

325
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,070
Thanks for caring.

326
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,220
Because it's Ri El.

327
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,030
Hello.

328
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,840
Please take me to KM Financial Headquarters.

329
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,430
Okay.

330
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,980
   
  

331
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,220
   

332
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:59,110
Hello. I'm Social Contribution Team Leader Ye Ri El who's MCing this final evaluation event.

333
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,820
As this program's director,

334
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm honored to be here with such amazing entrepreneurs.

335
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,830
And we have a special judge this year. KM Financial's CEO will be taking part in the judging.

336
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,840
He's the one who will be presenting one of you with 100 million won.

337
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,960
Please give a warm round of applause to welcome him.

350
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,920
  Ji Ah. Let's tell him everything. 

351
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,970
  You can't tell him. Are you listening to me? 

352
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,980
  Jo Ji Ah cannot meet Kim Min Kyu no matter what! 

353
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,290
  What are you going to do now, Kim Min Kyu?
