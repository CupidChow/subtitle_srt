1
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,730
   

2
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,790
Coffee with a lot of syrup, please.

3
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm craving something sweet.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,830
Some poor guy came by just now.

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,650
That timing though.

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,810
That guy's getting engaged, right? He just came by.

7
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,690
He came all the way here to announce that?

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,390
So is confessing out of the question now?

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,470
  Do you have any plans for accepting her feelings? 

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,800
  No matter how her appearance might change?  

11
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,760
 No matter how I change in my looks, 

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,080
  I hope you can still recognize me. 

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,260
 What did you just say? 

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,310
 Let's get married. 

15
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,250
 I think that 

16
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,690
 you also have feelings towards me. 

17
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,320
 - Me? 
 - Yeah. Otherwise, why would you come here? 

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,040
 That's because you said it was urgent. 

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,700
 But still, you chose to come to another guy while you were on a date? 

20
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,610
 You're not a guy to me. You're just my friend. 

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,440
 For real, am I not considered as a guy to you? 

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,570
 Hey, I'm going to become your friend's wife. 

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,820
 Watch your manners. 

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,570
 I'm forgiving you because you seem drunk tonight. 

25
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,470
Since when were you here?

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm getting engaged to Min Kyu.

27
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,060
Let's all have a meal one day and hash things out. We still have to see each other.

28
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,870
Hello?

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,700
- I'm Jang Doo Sam. 
- Yes.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,180
Please let Chairman Kim Min Kyu know

31
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,190
that if he promises to put President Hwang in jail, I'll give all my recordings to him.

32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,850
All right, I'll give you a call later.

33
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,060
- Team Leader Jo.
 - Yes?

34
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,400
- Director Yoon. 
 - Glad I bumped into you. Come with me.

35
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,200
Okay.

36
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,680
What is it?

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,310
   

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,740
- Are you Team Leader Jo Jin Bae?
 - Yes.

39
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,310
Come sit.

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,540
Please help out CEO Hwang a lot.

41
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,630
I am well aware of what you do for Kim Min Kyu.

42
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,630
I'm not telling you to quit doing that.

43
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm just saying that whatever you gain knowledge of, I hope we know it first.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,880
Soon KM Financial is going to have

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,230
a company-wide reorganization.

46
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,090
The system where Kim Min Kyu acted as king

47
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,780
will become a story of the past.

48
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,630
Do you think he will side with us?

49
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,450
He doesn't need to.

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,090
As long as it isn't Min Kyu's side.

51
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,090
What will you do about Jang Doo Sam?

52
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,350
 The robot industry doesn't make a lot of money yet, so 

53
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,990
  Kim Min Kyu won't invest in it. 

54
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,250
 Why don't you sell that part to Britain's Bold Group? 

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,120
 I know Chairman Martin well. 

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,680
 I can persuade Chairman Kim Min Kyu, President Hwang. 

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,540
 Please give me some of your support. 

58
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,250
 Either way, I think you are quite impressive, Chairman Park. 

59
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,110
 How did you think to 

60
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,650
 hide this robot in secret as a part of the R&amp;D team? 

61
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,300
- More than anything, we need to find out about it before Kim Min Kyu does.
 - Yes.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,370
Ah, before that, what about AG-3?

63
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,430
Hey, just confess it.

64
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,060
It's a problem if a robot loves a person, but is it a problem when a person loves a person?

65
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,090
Honestly, you're not an alien or something.

66
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,620
Is Kim Min Kyu actually going to kill you

67
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,450
because you're not a real robot?

68
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,050
Hey, listen. I planned to confess everything after the test.

69
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,480
But he ignores me this much as a robot. Imagine him knowing that I'm a person.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,130
He's going to charge at me to kill me.

71
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,060
You should wear this for the presentation.

72
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,530
With this on, Jin Bae or whoever won't recognize you.

73
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,560
Even I would ignore you.

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,300
Man, this is cool.

75
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,830
I have to look really strong to not be discouraged there.

76
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,330
Yes. You're the crazy bitch here!

77
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,710
Go to KM Financial!

78
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,840
Let's go!

79
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,310
AG-3 ate what?

80
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,000
- Yes. An ice cream. 
 - But it's a robot.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,760
- I didn't see it, but he did.
 - She really ate it.

82
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,990
- For real, like this. 
 - So it's not a robot, but a person?

83
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,570
No. I'm sure it's a robot.

84
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,150
It's a robot but it ate an ice cream?

85
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,890
I stabbed it with this, and this stick broke

86
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,430
as if it hit an iron plate.

87
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,840
If it was a person, it would scream, bleed, and cause chaos.

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,260
But it didn't even flinch.

89
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,110
I think it's an extremely great robot, Uncle.

90
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,230
Since we had to determine whether it's a human or a robot,

91
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,520
we failed to kidnap it.

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,870
However, next time for sureâ€”

93
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,220
Are you kidding me? What kind of excuse is that?

94
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,750
No really, it's a robot...

95
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,340
That Social Contribution Team Leader bastard.

96
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,590
He made these guys responsible for this and left?

97
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,560
How much money did you receive from the Social Contribution Team Leader?

98
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,010
30,000,000 won and an additional 30,000,000 won.

99
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,300
The remaining 40,000,000, Team Leader took...

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,420
Ah, seriously.

101
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,870
I'm giving you one more chance.

102
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,670
Make sure to bring AG-3 within three days. Understand?

103
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,010
Why? Is it not well-cooked?

104
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,910
Why are you being so nice to me these days? I can't get used to it.

105
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,630
- You don't like it? 
 - I'm not saying I don't like it.

106
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm just afraid what kind of job you will make me do next time.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,550
- You made the final rounds.
 - What?

108
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,320
KM Financial Competition for young entrepreneurs.

109
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm not taking your food. Eat slowly.

110
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,020
Chairman Kim Min Kyu's not the one judging. The social contribution team will be proceeding that.

111
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,110
And I'll be completely disguised so that even my brother can't recognize me.

112
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,430
You really don't have to worry.

113
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,290
If you had told me earlier, I could've helped you.

114
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,910
There's nothing for you to help with.

115
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,110
It was the same item that was submitted

116
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,630
four years ago, right? What happened then?

117
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,630
It's too early for you to ask me about that.

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,070
Of course, it got eliminated.

119
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,290
But this time, I'm really confident.

120
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,340
Someone said that I'm a genius.

121
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,430
What kind of crazy man said that?

122
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,430
He must be buttering you up to scam you.

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,570
You should've called me when you got eliminated from the contest.

124
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,820
I called you, but you didn't pick up.

125
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,350
I didn't pick up?

126
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,430
Then you should have come to school...

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,690
You did come.

128
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,920
By chance, is that the day we broke up?

129
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,180
   

130
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,650
 If you fight with your family members, 

131
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,970
 then you just go into your own rooms. 

132
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,680
 This can be used to express your apology then. 

133
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,340
 So, it can connect one's heart to another's. 

134
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,890
 Then what are our cell phones for? 

135
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,950
 Miss Jo, did you apply to build your resume? 

136
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,090
 I think we have to adjust the pelvic axis for the leg and construct it that way.
    

137
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,350
 Then wouldn't it become too thick and look strange? 

138
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,120
 If we don't adjust it, then I don't think the inverse kinematics won't be solvable. 

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,300
 The customer you called isn't available, so you will be connected to voicemail. 

140
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,540
 Are you in the lab? Did you pull an all-nighter again? 

141
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,530
 I'm missing you so much right now. 

142
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,180
 I'm heading over there so just show me your face for a bit. 

143
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,810
   

144
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,590
 If we just utilize this Jacobian algorithm, 

145
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,180
 the problem will be resolved. 

146
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,200
  What a nice atmosphere. It must be working out well. 

147
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,190
 I think there's going to be a good result soon. 

148
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,170
 I'll be looking forward to it. Oh, right. Ji Ah's here. 

149
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,060
 Oh really? 

150
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,050
 Is she asking you to make something again? 

151
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,030
 Don't help her too much so that she's not too hopeful. 

152
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,600
 I'm doing it because I like helping her. She never asked me for it. 

153
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,780
 Same thing. You're so slow-witted. 

154
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,450
 She's my girlfriend. Watch your manners. 

155
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,910
 - What are you doing here? 
 - You're here. 

156
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,060
 Why are you doing something that I didn't ask you to do? Please think before you act. 

157
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,410
 Did someone ask you to clean up? Are you a cleaner? 

158
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,060
â™«  Living as you hoped  â™«

159
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,310
 Ji Ah, I found a new route to solving a search algorithm. 

160
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,260
 You mean that thing you've been researching night and day? How? 

161
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,420
 The main point of communication between a robot and a person is to understand the pattern. 

162
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,830
 How fast and accurately it categorizes a person's mind and feelings into a pattern. That's the key point. 

163
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,080
 The expanded data that is essentially in 3-dimensions will be quickly stacked into groups in parallel worlds; thereby, creating a pattern 

164
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,050
 while securing both great speed and accuracy. 

165
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,760
 You didn't understand, right? 

166
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,040
 Yes, but I know that it's something great. 

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,560
 I'll make a robot that's capable of communicating emotions! 

168
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,380
 Congratulations!! 

169
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,490
 MIT is asking for me to come as soon as possible. 

170
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,460
 Then, are you heading to America? 

171
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,170
 Yes. You have to learn English from now on. 

172
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,580
 I'm also going? 

173
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,480
 Of course! Come to America with me and do whatever you want. 

174
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,800
 Don't waste time doing something that doesn't work. 

175
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,920
 What do you mean by that? 

176
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,450
 You said you're tired. Don't do it if you feel tired by it. 

177
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,460
 But you do it even if you're tired. 

178
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,630
 Are you the same as me? 

179
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,720
â™«  That kind of love  â™«

180
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,910
 Let's break up. 

181
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,000
â™«  I'm really jealous  â™«

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,310
 Let's not see each other ever again. 

183
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:59,650
â™«  Like you before, I want to love like that  â™«

184
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,710
Before Chairman Park Seong Jin died, he met President Hwang Do Won.

185
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,420
And there's a recording of that night's conversation?

186
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,360
Yes. President Hwang had definitely previously known that Santa Maria was a robot development team.

187
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,890
You know what that implies, right?

188
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,050
It's proof that President Hwang intentionally sold Daeyang Shipbuilding at the lowest price.

189
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,630
We can't legally charge him with the recording as evidence, but it's reason enough to have him dismissed from the board of directors.

190
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,170
CEO Hwang won't be able to avoid punishment since he headed the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

191
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,930
There's no way they wouldn't have stolen a part of that tremendous amount of money in the sales process.

192
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,330
I think the same. The rebate amount would be tremendous.

193
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,890
It's similar to Yoosung Group's rebate incident where they got paid for omission of information.

194
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,120
As Jang Doo Sam wanted, give him my contact information.

195
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,610
In order to protect Santa Maria, we have to get our hands on the recording

196
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,420
before those people realize there's a recording in existence.

197
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,950
And I will give you all my ID and passwords that grant full access to all of KM Financial's information,

198
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,490
so secure additional proof. We don't have time.

199
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,600
Okay, got it.

200
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,490
Then what time should I prepare for you to head into the office tomorrow?

201
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,530
Head into the office?

202
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,770
I thought you were taking part in the final evaluation for the young entrepreneur competition.

203
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,660
That is under the Social Contributions team.

204
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,460
Oh, okay.

205
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you all this time.

206
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:58,220
A bonus... When this work is finished, I'll give you 100%.

207
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,190
300%.

208
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,460
200%. That's it.

209
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,030
Got it.

210
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,260
The moon was bright? A crescent moon was so bright, huh?

211
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,580
I know, right? It was a crescent moon, but strangely, it was bright.

212
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,160
Where did you two go without me?

213
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,200
We didn't go anywhere.

214
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,290
I saw it all.

215
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,810
I was cold but you left me on the bench and went away by yourselves. I saw.

216
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,960
No, we didn't.

217
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,330
Don't imagine anything. Did you guys, by any chance, kiss?

218
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,720
Kiss? Sun Hye wanted to go to the bathroom so I walked her. That's all.

219
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,350
Hyung, you're scaring me. Stop it.

220
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,690
I find you scarier when you're like that. Please stop. Let's go in.

221
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,490
Oh, and pay for today's coffee.

222
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,680
It's cold.

223
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,050
Why do I have to keep buying it when you keep doing bad things?

224
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,990
You must find the coffee here really good.

225
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,650
It's cheap.

226
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,100
It's really good to me.

227
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,460
It lacks a bit of flavor for me.

228
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,790
Do you know that coffee and dating are really similar?

229
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,700
You have to collect many different beans, roast them, taste them.

230
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,420
You're searching for the moment when the coffee tastes perfect for you. That's exactly what dating is like.

231
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:38,390
Yeah, that's right. Searching for someone who's perfect for me.

232
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,790
That's what dating is. You're right.

233
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,130
It's not easy to find something that perfectly suits your taste.

234
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,830
If it doesn't suit your taste, then why do you come here?

235
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,300
Because the price is cheap.

236
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,510
This guy, he's strangely playing hard to get.

237
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,700
- Pardon me? 
 - Pardon?

238
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,090
- What did you just say? 
 - Include me, too. What?

239
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,140
Last time, she mumbled something, too.

240
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,670
Oh, you arrived?

241
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,980
Help me.

242
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,950
I know that I've made a lot of mistakes, so help me.

243
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,690
Where's the electricity?

244
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,730
This doesn't work either.

245
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,580
- Why doesn't it work? 
- What's going on?

246
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,290
Surprise!

247
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,970
You should've told us earlier. See? We can help you like this.

248
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,730
Get first place and while you're at it, get second, too!
   

249
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,220
You promised. Four insurances and a bonus.
   

250
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,840
What's all of this? You guys, sorry. And thank you.

251
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,170
I heard that the final screening is held like a free market. Then having fun is the main focus.

252
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,290
Think of us as your judges and explain freely.

253
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,170
Dear, are you there?

254
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,270
Yes, I am here!

255
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,180
Like that, no matter how far apart they are in this world, these two are connected.

256
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,530
Is there something wrong?

257
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,090
By any chance, did you study quantum physics or know anything about quantum?

258
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,780
What's that?

259
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,760
Quantum entanglement.

260
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,130
It's a theory where two particles that are far apart are still connected,

261
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,820
so if one particle makes an action, it will affect the other particle.

262
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,940
It means that no matter how far apart they are in this world, they're connected.

263
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,710
Wow, that's so amazing.

264
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,700
Yeah, that's amazing. We studied until our brains exploded, but how do you know about it just like that?

265
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,980
We have a true genius right here.

266
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,960
Then do I have the right to be a part of this genius group now?

267
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,740
I'll let you in. Also, later in the future, give me one. I want one.

268
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,550
Who are you going to give it to? Tell me your heart.

269
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,920
It's for my mom.

270
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,180
Let's keep practicing.

271
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:46,290
â™«  I have been in pain for a few days  â™«

272
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,870
â™«  Because my heart is overwhelmed by you  â™«

273
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,080
    

274
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,910
â™«   Falling asleep  â™«

275
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,940
â™«   is hard.   â™«

276
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,400
â™«  Even though I'm next to you,  â™«

277
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,730
â™«  My heart can't go to you,  â™«

278
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,150
â™«   I always miss you.  â™«

279
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,020
  There's something my father used to always say. 

280
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,940
â™«  Today has turned into tears  â™«

281
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,040
  "One person is enough." 

282
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,780
 If you have one person, you can endure through things without breaking. 

283
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,320
â™«  I want to call you  â™«

284
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,560
â™«  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  â™«

285
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,330
  We wander as we try to find that one person. 

286
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,560
  We hope to become that person for someone. 

287
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,420
 That person can become a reason for my life. 

288
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:56,070
â™«  It doesn't seem like you can see my heart  â™«

289
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,260
 And hope that that person will be a star that lights up my path. 

290
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,490
â™«  Of tears that I had to erase and erase again, you wouldn't know  â™«

291
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:12,030
  Perhaps, you are already that person for someone. 

292
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,190
â™«  Having these feelings  â™«

293
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,860
â™«  Even though I'm by your side, I miss you.  â™«

294
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,810
â™«  Even if it's just once  â™«

295
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,520
â™«  If I am in your arms and am calling your name  â™«

296
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,540
â™«   I want to tell you.  â™«

297
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,540
This is only the beginning. Are you all right?

298
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,700
I can feel it. It's kicking.

299
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,600
You can feel it?

300
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,550
â™«  Repeating over and over the words of my heart  â™«

301
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,990
â™«   Now matter how much I yell,   â™«

302
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,620
â™«  It doesn't seem like you can hear  â™«

303
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,160
â™«  Every day, only in my heart and only with my eyes  â™«

304
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:17,800
â™«  I could say the words of love for you  â™«

305
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,260
Why isn't he picking up? Did something really happen?

306
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,750
His blood levels are really good. He would be really amazed if he saw.

307
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:56,900
   

308
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,360
   

309
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,990
   

310
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,780
You came here early.

311
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,080
Hello!

312
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,560
The situation was really crazy, so I wasn't able to say it then. I'm really thankful, Jo Ji Ah.

313
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,580
Being able to come here is thanks to you.

314
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,410
That's right.

315
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,380
- Really. 
- Thank you!

316
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,270
Not at all, I only grabbed their attention. We did all the hard work together.

317
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,460
Let's all do our best and whoever wins, let's applaud wholeheartedly.

318
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,230
Yes.

319
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,120
Good luck!

320
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,960
Did you call for me?

321
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,680
Change the supervisor of today's competition to the CEO.

322
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,740
What is the reason that CEO Hwang is taking part in this?

323
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,500
It is him trying to support you.

324
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,220
If a competition gets supervised by the CEO, then the person in charge will get a good evaluation.

325
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,070
Thanks for caring.

326
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,220
Because it's Ri El.

327
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,030
Hello.

328
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,840
Please take me to KM Financial Headquarters.

329
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,430
Okay.

330
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,980
   
  

331
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,220
   

332
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:59,110
Hello. I'm Social Contribution Team Leader Ye Ri El who's MCing this final evaluation event.

333
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,820
As this program's director,

334
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm honored to be here with such amazing entrepreneurs.

335
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,830
And we have a special judge this year. KM Financial's CEO will be taking part in the judging.

336
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,840
He's the one who will be presenting one of you with 100 million won.

337
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,960
Please give a warm round of applause to welcome him.

  Do you know what you guys have done?

  A person could've died at the blink of an eye!

  He could've died because of me. You didn't think that far, did you? 

350
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,920
  Ji Ah. Let's tell him everything. 

351
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,970
  You can't tell him. Are you listening to me? 

352
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,980
  Jo Ji Ah cannot meet Kim Min Kyu no matter what! 

353
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,290
  What are you going to do now, Kim Min Kyu?
