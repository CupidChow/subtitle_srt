1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,540
I want to kiss...

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,920
Ri El.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,240
I have to go on a date with Ri El three times. 
    

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,600
I have to prepare well for the date so I can recover perfectly from last time's mistake.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,310
Then on the last date, I'll kiss her to finish it off.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,500
But the problem is the kiss.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,680
I can prepare for the date somehow, but I don't know when to kiss.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,200
How to kiss. I can't get a feel for that at all.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
I have to catch Ri El's heart.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,160
It's my first time kissing someone.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,220
She's quite good at making useless things. So what use does this have?

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,230
- Wear what you used to. 
- No.

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,630
- That will be my compensation for fixing the lamp. 
- I've worn this enough times.

14
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,870
Let me wear something new for a change.

15
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,930
And also, I'm leaving soon as it is, but why don't you worry about my welfare?

16
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,810
Also, this isn't the problem.

17
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,730
He wants to kiss. He wants me to help him. It's his first kiss.

18
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,900
How am I supposed to help him with this?

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,450
It's not like I can practice with him or anything.

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,490
Practice? We'll help him.

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,320
- What? 
 - Us?

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,800
Us? Impossible.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,320
You got rejected by Jo Ji Ah.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,040
Sunbae Hoktal... I don't even need to explain. He's never dated anyone before.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,700
When was the last time I dated someone? As for Sunbae Pi...

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,620
Wow. No comment.

27
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,230
I'm craving soju suddenly.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,810
Why do you live like this?

29
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,850
Does anyone know someone who knows a lot about this stuff?

30
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,990
Who is it?

31
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,320
I don't know, but a woman got out.

32
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,640
Let me see.

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,540
 Timing and Subtitles by The Robotic Team @ viki.com  

34
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,510
Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm Jo Ji Ah's friend and today's kiss instructor, Hwang Sun Hye.

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,150
Nice to meet you. This is my team and I'm Hong—

37
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,730
Oh my gosh.

38
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,160
She looks exactly the same.

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,200
Ji Ah, how did you suppress this?

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,130
If it were me, I would have destroyed all of this immediately.

41
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,450
We'll sue you then.

42
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,880
But who is this? Oh, Doctor Hong's guard?

43
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,230
This coffee place is good.

44
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,970
One never knows when it will disappear so I hope you can come sooner than later. I've got coupons marked for you, too.

45
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,590
Summer snow? The name is very irrational.

46
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,210
There is no snow in the summer and in the play "The Bald Soprano," there is no bald soprano.

47
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,950
Irrational. That's life!

48
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,370
I will introduce you to Kim Min Kyu as my acquaintance.

49
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,940
Sun Hye, you're not supposed to know about AG-3.

50
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,120
So you have to think of me not as a robot but as a person.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,540
Okay. So where's my student?

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,310
Goddess of... Kiss?

53
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,980
Her name is Hwang Sun Hye. I know her through another person. She's very famous.

54
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,670
AG-3, look her up.

55
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,760
Hwang Sun Hye, 28 years old.

56
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,530
She is a dating consultant who is known as the Goddess of Kiss.

57
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,390
With a resume of having dated dozens of men,

58
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,230
she rose in ranks as a dating mentor to youngsters in their twenties.

59
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,140
Her main lesson is related to kissing.

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,280
There are many reviews stating that they successfully had their first kiss after taking her lesson.

61
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,810
I'll have to see for myself. Why don't we start?

62
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,510
If it doesn't sound promising, I'll end it right away.

63
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,180
Sure.

64
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,720
 You'll have to stop by for a bit.   

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,090
Excuse me for a moment.

66
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,410
When a man and woman meet, it takes about three steps before they get to the kiss.

67
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,730
The step of actively showing a charming personality.

68
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,370
The step of a romantic atmosphere.

69
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,590
The step of focusing on physical touch.

70
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,180
So it needs three dates at the very least.

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,180
But this woman is your first love and you know each other very well, right?

72
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,260
You can skip the first two and go straight to the third.

73
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,120
What does that mean? For you,

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,110
there are three chances for you to try.

75
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,950
Okay. I like it. Continue.

76
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,060
I want cold water with lots of ice.

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,030
Wait. She is not someone you order around.

78
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,940
Then?

79
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,830
She's a friend.

80
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,160
I'll be careful. I apologize.

81
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,880
Carry on.

82
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,270
When a man and a woman are friends, there's the positive aspect of being closely acquainted.

83
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,600
But the fatal disadvantage is that she doesn't yet see you as a man.

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,240
A transformation from friend to man is needed here.

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,740
What exactly do you need for that? Sexual tension.

86
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,940
Tension of sexual nature. Kissing has timing, too.

87
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,030
When everything is in place, the moment of "right now" comes.

88
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,140
What is the condition of a kiss that we need at that time?

89
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,160
Sexual tension?

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,380
That's right! Sexual tension.

91
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,020
Kim Min Kyu, have you ever dreamed of kissing her?

92
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,910
No. Never.

93
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,770
What a relief.

94
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,730
Why is that a relief?

95
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,990
Because then, we can try the next exercise.

96
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,330
Two of you, come with me.

97
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,680
- What happened? 
- I can't get it to adhere to the PVP surface.

98
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,240
Adhere it first, then take care of auto plasma using the PDM.

99
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,270
But why did you call me? You can do this alone though.

100
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,650
Yes, but I sprained my wrist.

101
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,970
Your wrist? Let me see.

102
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,640
It's swollen. Let's put a patch on.

103
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,080
- I love the opening the best. 
- Me, too.

104
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,690
You guys are on a date.

105
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,480
Walk slowly side by side.

106
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,680
Stop thinking about anything and slowly keep walking.

107
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,460
♫  I want to tell you   ♫

108
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,210
♫  I want to call you  ♫

109
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,290
♫  Your lips   ♫

110
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,980
♫  my heart longing for them  ♫

111
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,690
Do you still not see this person as a woman, Kim Min Kyu?

112
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,010
♫  No matter how I try  ♫

113
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,390
It's impossible. I will never see this person as a woman.

114
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,160
Let's stop messing around and get right to the point.

115
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,130
I wasn't messing around and just now was the point.

116
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,800
Don't forget the feeling, atmosphere, and eye contact from just now.

117
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,610
That was sexual tension and at that moment you kiss one another.

118
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,710
I'll give you an advice for free before I leave.

119
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,970
If it rains, bring an umbrella. Don't forget this.

120
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,350
Min Kyu and El Ri are getting married, right?

121
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,630
Yes.

122
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:57,980
If you were the main shareholder, you would've been chosen as their son-in-law.

123
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,420
What should I help you with?

124
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,290
Are you just going to stay still and let Min Kyu take her from you?

125
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,500
No. Before that, I must take care of AG-3.

126
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,260
I thought I would need to go with you.

127
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,710
No, I'll be there so why—

128
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,670
You're going on a date with your first love.

129
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,700
What will you do if AG-3 falls, gets damaged, or is low on battery?

130
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,930
Will you take her and leave in the middle of your date?

131
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,870
Don't worry, I'll only look after AG-3. I won't interfere.

132
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,420
Okay, let's go.

133
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,860
Seriously...

134
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,200
- Let's go. Why?
 - I said no already. Let's go back.

135
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,040
- Stop.
- Just come with me, please!

136
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,290
Just why did you bring me here with you?

137
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,510
I would like you to help me out.

138
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,840
Look at me. Don't you think I need help more than to give help?

139
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,160
That's why. This atmosphere around you.

140
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,220
If you just go in and stay quiet with this atmosphere around you, then you'll be helping me enough. Isn't that interesting?

141
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,070
- Let's go quickly. 
- Why would I? Let's go back.

142
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,130
Just for once. Let's go!

143
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,330
Oh, you guys actually did come.

144
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:32,210
I like coffee and would like to take you on a date—

145
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:38,560
I'm flattered. Should I get you two Americanos with two shots?

146
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,990
I'll... take a latte.

147
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,760
A man who wants a latte when everyone likes Americano.

148
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,090
I like it.

149
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,300
- Americano. Latte.
 - Thank you.

150
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,460
It must be hot.

151
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,960
They must be on their date by now.

152
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,270
Where are they going?

153
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,540
For the first date, it's okay to go wherever as long as it's not a place with a lot of people.

154
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,950
You want to go on a date around here?

155
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,580
Yeah, this is a popular place. The street of youth.

156
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,450
What are you holding?

157
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,490
Ah, it's an umbrella. They said it will rain later.

158
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,230
I don't think so.

159
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,410
I'm not sure... I'm pretty sure I'm right.

160
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,910
This place does seem popular.

161
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,660
Okay. I let you take care of today's date, so let's do the things you planned and see how it goes.

162
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,570
Should we go?

163
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,090
 It's best to not go to places that you went to with your ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. 

164
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,210
 You will start to compare your current date with your ex. 

165
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,250
Please look at these! Aren't the dolls cute?

166
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,170
Okay.

167
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,280
Should I buy this for Dong Hyun?

168
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,210
Guys, nowadays, like these.

169
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,800
Dong Hyun is a girl.

170
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,410
Come here!

171
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,840
I'll pick one out for you.

172
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,090
   

173
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,990
This one. Try this one on.

174
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,990
It'll ruin my hair.

175
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,920
Look at this. What do you think?

176
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,380
I think I saw you somewhere...

177
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,310
Ah! You were with the other girl the other time!

178
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,720
Ah, I'm sorry.

179
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,990
 I'm right, though. 

180
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,370
 If you meet someone you know, it will become messy. 

181
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,760
Doctor's heart must be fluttering right now, too.

182
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,450
- Why would his heart be fluttering? 
- He went along with them.

183
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,130
He must be crazy. Why did he tag along with them?!

184
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,930
Excuse me, Sun Hye. I have to go. Where is the restroom?

185
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,440
Ah, that way. However, there's no toilet paper.

186
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
No. I just need to pee.

187
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,300
Just pee.

188
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,680
Wash your hands before you come out.

189
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,660
Why are your eye balls about to pop out?

190
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,780
The robot just d-drank the j-juice.

191
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,670
Oh, is that so? The robot drank something?

192
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,780
What are you talking about? Come back to your senses, punk!

193
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,740
Um... Wait right here for a minute.

194
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,830
Where is he going now?

195
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,910
You want me to wear these?

196
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,860
If your feet hurt, you should've told me earlier.

197
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm sorry.

198
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,010
They're comfortable. They're a bit old-fashioned, but comfortable.

199
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,800
They look good together.

200
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,860
I know, right? They do look good together.

201
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,180
Those two people there, their activities and ours are overlapping each other for some reason.

202
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,370
Is that right? Well, I'm not so sure about that.

203
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,590
Those two look really good together though.

204
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,090
Well, I'm not too sure about that either.

205
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,190
That one's mine.

206
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,380
Why are those two always sticking by each other so tightly like that? They don't even need to use the bathroom?

207
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,400
We must split those two apart.

208
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,400
Our drinks are ready.

209
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,510
They can't see. So eat.

210
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,610
So I can work harder after eating this?

211
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,580
All right, I will.

212
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,230
We used to go out on dates like that a lot back in the day.

213
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,530
What are you saying? We never came out to this kind of place for dates.

214
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,820
Yes, we have! Think about it carefully. You just can't remember it, that's all.

215
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,610
What's going on that your eyes are about to pop out?

216
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,660
That's not a robot; it's a human.

217
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,420
It's not a robot this time but a human? What the hell are you talking about?!

218
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,200
Earlier that robot was drinking a glass of juice, but now it's eating an ice cream!

219
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,180
- Did you eat something bad? 
 - She really did eat those things.

220
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,420
- How can a robot eat? 
- That's what I'm saying?!

221
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,690
Just go home if you're going to say useless stuff like that. I can do this by myself.

222
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,990
Fine, Uncle. I'll just have to prove it to you myself then.

223
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,600
Whatever. Just drink that.

224
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,790
But why is your name Hoktal?

225
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,030
Planet of the Apes.

226
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:41,040
No way. How dare they compare such a handsome face to that.

227
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,810
Who's the person that gave you the nickname? I'll scold them for that.

228
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,640
Scold them...

229
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,130
You guys didn't talk about anything in the short amount of time I was gone, right?

230
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,050
Do you think the kiss will successfully happen tonight?

231
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,670
I'm curious about which side will succeed.

232
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,440
So pretty. This is super expensive in New York.

233
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,390
Should I buy it for you?

234
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,830
It's okay. I was just looking at the design.

235
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,270
How long do we have to stay here?

236
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,880
Until their date is over.

237
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
- Then ki— 
 - Ki... what?

238
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,620
Nothing.

239
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,530
- I'm sorry. 
- That's okay.

240
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,300
It looks like it's going to rain.

241
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,820
I'll be back after buying an umbrella. Don't go anywhere and wait here.

242
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,870
She's a robot after all.

243
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,560
This looks so unique, don't you think so?

244
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,530
Yeah, it does.

245
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,750
Hold on.

246
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,200
I must get going. It's urgent.

247
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,730
Already? Can you stay a bit longer? It should be coming soon.

248
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,830
What is?

249
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,100
Rain.

250
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,830
I'm sorry but it seems very urgent.

251
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,390
We haven't even had dinner yet. Then when will our next date be?

252
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,450
I'll give you a call.

253
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,780
Then... Take this umbrella with you. It's really going to rain.

254
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,670
Even if it rains, it doesn't seem like it'll rain that much anyway.

255
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:18,020
The general critique of today's date is that it is better than hot chocolate.

256
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm off now.

257
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,570
Uncle, it was a robot after all.

258
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,930
Of course, she's a robot if she broke this. Do you think she's human?!

259
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,480
Proving it to me, my ass. You still have long ways to go if you want to catch up to me.

260
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,070
It's raining.

261
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,700
I'm using my umbrella in this way, I suppose.

262
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:45,880
This is my most favorite umbrella. Feel honored that you get to use it.

263
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,860
Do you want me to show you something cool?
