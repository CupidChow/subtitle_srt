1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,200
- What is with this timing?
 - What do you mean?

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,730
Too perfect, as if you were watching me this whole time.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,560
- It's an "I'm about to go buy some pain relief patches" kind of timing. 
- Patches?

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,260
The butler here has been working my researchers as if they're paid handymen so they are about to collapse.

5
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,310
Why don't you consider hiring some workers?

6
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,140
Ah. I don't like having people loitering around in my sight.

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,150
But you're fine with us being around?

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,460
Why would I be? I'm only holding it in because of AG-3.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,700
Ah. So what brings you here at this hour?

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,070
I need to see AG-3 for a moment.

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,380
I'll talk to her inside, so tell everyone to leave.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,420
That won't be allowed. She's in the middle of charging.

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,340
I am going to see her as she's charging.

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,700
You can't. If you do, her battery might explode.

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,690
I wasn't going to say this,

16
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,220
but I heard AG-3's voice coming from inside a moment ago.

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,200
What is that then, Doctor?

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,860
Her skin sensor is broken so we're fixing it,

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,390
because someone touched her too much. If you can, you should refrain from touching her.

20
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,040
Otherwise, there will be a huge cost to fixing her.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,620
That's my choice.

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,290
Whether I want to send AG-3 or not is my choice.

23
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,780
If you don't like it, then pack up and leave.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,960
Then I'll really pack up now. Immediately.

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,860
No!

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,510
   

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,950
- It's Baton. 
- How do you know that?

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,340
Be quiet.

29
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,610
We put a tracker on his phone.

30
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,980
Therefore, if he goes anywhere with his phone, a red dot will indicate where he is.

31
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,010
You guys are so hospitable. I'm touched.

32
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,070
What the heck.

33
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,440
- Are you sure the lights are off at the main house? 
- Yes, he must be sleeping.

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,270
- What? 
- Is it an ostrich? 
- No, a flamingo.

35
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,810
This is embarrassing.

36
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,010
I'm American style, so only swimming.

37
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,420
- Do you want to go in first? 
 - Let's go in together! 
 - Okay!

38
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,130
- Wait. Let's warm up. One, two. 
- That's enough.

39
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,890
Oh my gosh! That scared the crap out of me!!

40
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,500
Did you see Baton?!

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,530
Oh my! He's crazy! You crazy punk!!

42
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,720
- Baton!
 - Crazy. Oh, wait up!

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,730
Crazy punk.

44
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,970
- He's crazy. Absolutely crazy!
- He's completely crazy. The craziest!

45
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,760
- He's a psychiatric patient. 
- Take the tube off!

46
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,200
What's the problem?

47
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay. What do you think?

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,730
Jo Ji Ah said that he's normal.

49
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,040
What do you trust about her?

50
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
I think she would know more about him than we do.

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,600
So what? Just send her to Baton?

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,270
Why don't you believe in Jo Ji Ah's judgment?

53
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,760
Was she not a trustworthy person when you were dating her?

54
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,830
That's... not it.

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,870
If not, then it's this.

56
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,800
Whether he's a pervert or not, you don't want to send her to him.

57
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,910
Chi-maek, are you down? 
('Chi'cken and 'maek'-joo - beer)

58
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,880
How is this chicken and beer?

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Myeol-'chi' (anchovy) and beer. Chi-maek.

60
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,010
- Cheers!
 - Cheers.

61
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,480
- I'll feed you one.
 - Ah.

62
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,500
Eat up.

63
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,410
It's delicious.

64
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,500
Earning money is hard, right?

65
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,550
What do you mean?

66
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,280
You see, I'm fine with whatever you do.

67
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,980
You should do what you want to do in life.

68
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,870
Hong Joo.

69
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,290
That's why I think you being a lawyer fits well.

70
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,970
What about Ji Ah? Did you meet up with her?

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,070
My head hurts because of her right now. She's not picking up my calls.

72
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,780
It's because she dated the wrong guy.

73
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,720
If only she hadn't dated that weird professor who makes robots.

74
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,540
R-Robot? Professor?

75
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,100
Did I not tell you?

76
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,110
Wh-What was that professor's name?

77
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,520
What was it? Uhm... H-Hong—

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,100
- Hong Baek Gyun?
 - That's right. Hong Baek Gyun.

79
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,190
How did you know that, Honey?

80
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,370
That son of a—

81
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,170
I wasn't saying it to you.

82
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,540
 Professor, you have a guest. 

83
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,760
 How do you do? 

84
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,310
 So, you are asking me to make this for you? 

85
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,530
 Yes. You are a genius so I'm sure you can make it. 

86
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,780
 That's probably true but why are you trying to make something like this anyway? 

87
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,640
 I think it would be great to have something like this. 

88
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:52,120
 When a couple are walking with an umbrella and they want to feel as if they're walking in the rain, then they can press the button to make the umbrella transparent. 

89
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,610
 And then when they want to kiss each other all of a sudden, they can make it opaque again to kiss secretly without others knowing. 

90
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,270
 Wouldn't people really want something like this if it ever existed? 

91
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:07,250
 I understand but don't you think that only a small group of people would want something like this? 

92
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,110
 Is it not okay to make something for a smaller audience? 

93
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,890
 Something that people don't know about but it would be great to have if it existed. I want to make things like that. 

94
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,540
 But I can't make it since I don't have the technology to do so. 

95
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,290
 So I'm trying to make it by working with a person like you that has the brains and the technology to do so. 

96
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,580
 And it would be even better if we could make money off of it as well. 

97
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,770
 Won't you make it? 

98
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,300
♫  It feels like there can be some time for me  ♫

99
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,170
♫  The time feels so far but I really wanted it  ♫

100
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,660
 - Look at his hair. 
♫  It's something that you wanted  ♫ 

101
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,350
 - Hello. 
- Hello. 

102
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,230
 - Hello.
- Look at his hair! 

103
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,850
 Totally funny looking. 

104
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,690
♫  I just wanna know, how long I've been waiting  for so long. 

105
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,960
♫  The moment that we meet  ♫

106
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,850
♫  Would you notice me? Would you even look at me?  ♫

107
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,760
♫  My heart that's so concerned  ♫

108
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,160
♫  is my feelings of love for you. As if you are coming close to me  ♫

109
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,280
 It's raining! 

110
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,200
 It's raining so much. 

111
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,750
♫  Even when I close my eyes  ♫

112
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:56,730
♫  It's been just awhile ago when we parted  ♫

113
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,750
♫  I've been thinking about you so much than any other time  ♫

114
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,380
♫  You've been waiting for me all this time  ♫

115
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,630
♫  When I see you my heart gets smaller and smaller. I wanna know your feelings  ♫

116
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,300
♫  I've been waiting for this moment for a long time  ♫

117
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,490
♫  The moment that I get to meet you...  ♫

118
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,480
♫  Would you notice me? Would you look at me?  ♫

119
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:37,010
♫  My heart that is concerned is my feelings of love for you  ♫

120
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,370
Let me greet you officially.  I am Jo Ji Ah's older brother, Jo Jin Bae.

121
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,640
Let me do the same. I am Jo Ji Ah's ex-boyfriend, Hong Baek Gyun.

122
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,820
AG-3, friend mode.

123
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,480
What now?

124
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,660
I've been waiting for you to come for so long, yet that's all the greeting I get?

125
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,580
Yup.

126
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,680
Yup? Are you upset with me or something?

127
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,840
Why should I be upset with you? I don't have a heart or a mind.

128
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't be like that. I have so much to say to you and so much to ask you today.

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,590
You have a lot of friends besides me though.

130
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,720
No, you're the only friend that I have to talk to a lot and ask a lot of questions of.

131
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,080
What about... yesterday...

132
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,050
Your first love. If she's not a friend, what is she?

133
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,690
Nope, she's not my friend.

134
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,080
Seriously?

135
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,710
She's a girl.

136
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,200
By the way, I've never dated someone before,

137
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,010
so why does it feel like I'm getting scolded by a girl I've dated for years?

138
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,370
No, more importantly, this pattern of conversation is familiar.

139
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,380
I wonder why.

140
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,190
Oh, you still didn't take out the necklace out of that box.

141
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,490
But how did you know that there was a necklace inside of that thing?

142
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,370
It was just a wild guess.

143
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,270
- Open it up. 
- Me?

144
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,590
Hurry it up, I want to make sure it is safe.

145
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,750
Look, it is perfectly safe and sound.

146
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,760
Oh, what a relief.

147
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,720
Put it on me.

148
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,140
 Something seems to be switched here. 

149
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,730
Finally, it has returned.

150
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,410
Are you happy that you found what belonged to your mother?

151
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,780
It also belonged to my father as well.

152
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,020
On a hill where you could see meteorites showering down in the night sky,

153
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,230
my father proposed to my mother with this necklace.

154
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,480
The thing that's inside of this necklace is a meteorite. It's a piece of a star.

155
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,750
If you were a star, I want to be a piece of it. A meaning like that.

156
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,140
AG-3, show me the night sky of Mt. Hwangmae.

157
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,200
That's the place where my father proposed to my mother.

158
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,100
It really seems like you exclaiming. At moments like this, you seem like a human.

159
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,390
Fine, I will take you to that place when there is a meteor shower this winter.

160
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,390
 When that time comes, AG-3 will be the one going there instead of me. 

161
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
AG-3.

162
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,820
If I do marry someone one day,

163
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,740
I'm going to propose to her with this necklace.

164
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,640
Kim Min Kyu, you didn't show up to work, I see.

165
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,010
Nice to see you, Hwang Yoo Cheol. No. Should I call you CEO Hwang now?

166
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,580
Aren't you supposed to start tomorrow?

167
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,990
I came a day early because I heard that Min Kyu would be here, but he didn't come.

168
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,910
I don't get to see him that often either because our schedules don't align well.

169
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,810
Wow. A CEO's room is definitely different.

170
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:28,400
Well if you like it then, yes.  I will put a desk for you over there. Do you want to freeload?

171
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,370
You want to put me by your side, CEO?

172
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,910
No, it's because I'm worried that you'll cause trouble so I want you where I can see you. Okay?

173
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,120
You've become so much better at hitting on women while I haven't seen you in a while. Are you handling your M&amp;A's by flirting?

174
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,070
Are you going to fall for me if I flirt? All right, you wait and see.

175
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,710
You're one step late. My dad told me to get married.

176
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:53,010
He wants you to go on a blind date? Bring me the list and I will weed out all the trashy men out for you.

177
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,820
No need to do that. It's already been decided.

178
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,840
Who do you think it is?

179
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,170
Could it be...

180
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,860
Kim Min Kyu? It can't be him, right?

181
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,280
AG-3, listen to me carefully. I have a friend, but that friend of mine

182
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,680
has been proposed to, not too long ago, by his first love.

183
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,520
You did?!

184
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,450
Not me, this is my friend we're talking about here.

185
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,500
But that friend has a super trivial sickness.

186
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,510
You do?

187
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,980
No, not me! My friend I said!!

188
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,000
Fine, let's just say you have a friend. What's the disease?

189
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,590
It's a very annoying and troublesome disease. And it's a disease you can die from if you aren't careful.

190
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,520
Allergy?

191
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,960
Do you think I can live with my first love without telling her about the disease?

192
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,420
It's just an allergy so why can't you mention something like that?

193
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,930
Is it some kind of annoying allergy? One without a definite cause or reason?

194
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,290
Okay, I will tell you again, so listen carefully.

195
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,180
Do you think a marriage where you can't hold hands or kiss is possible?

196
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,220
So you, or rather your friend,

197
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,950
has a disease, not a deadly one but it is still lethal if he's not careful, so it's a very annoying disease.

198
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:20,230
And his first love proposed to him so he is concerned if he can live with love alone, isn't that right?

199
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,110
Yeah.

200
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,250
Why is love called love? Love is called love because you're supposed to embrace it all and continue onward  together.

201
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,320
It's because you don't really understand. It's not a small matter, you know.

202
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,690
Do you still get excited when you think about that first love? Does your heart beat because of her?

203
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:41,390
Yeah. As soon as I heard that she was coming, I felt excited and tingly. I was a mess.

204
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,960
- Dammit. 
- Why? I can't feel that way?

205
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,360
Of course you can. Your heart belongs to you after all.

206
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,500
What you're saying is, then...

207
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,150
Being excited and feeling tingly are driving you crazy, so what can you do? You have to try.

208
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:59,430
To that dammit-- I mean to that first love. You should go to her, open up about your concerns, hold her hand, and walk toward your future together.

209
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,900
Just what did you hear until now? I told you I can't hold her hand!

210
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,420
- Why not?! 
- Because of my allergy!

211
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,630
- What about your allergy?! 
- It's an allergy where I can't come in contact with human beings!

212
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,270
   

213
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,230
   

214
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,550
Do you think robots are stupid? There is no such disease in this world.

215
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,650
Well, I suppose. I mean, until Galileo appeared, everyone thought the Earth was flat.

216
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,050
Ah. So hungry. Operational mode.

217
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,580
Master, the weather feels like someone will send you a letter today.

218
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,490
 Do you know how delicious those tiny crabs are deep-fried or stir-fried? 

219
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm going to deep-fry half of these and stir-fry the remaining half.

220
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,960
There is a golden recipe for deep and stir-frying.

221
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,000
Instead of ruining the ingredient due to pride,

222
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,230
I recommend that you refer to a recipe from a famous restaurant.

223
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,130
Okay.

224
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,410
However, don't you think there's quite a lot?

225
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,350
Don't you think it'll be more delicious to share with others?

226
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,140
I already did.

227
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,940
There will probably be a mess soon.

228
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,120
What's gotten into Baton?

229
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,940
I was just feeling hungry.

230
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,790
Let's go, seafood party.

231
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,720
- What is that?!!
 - Oh my goodness!!!

232
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,830
How could you even think about making a robot that resembles your ex-girlfriend?

233
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,840
Aren't you embarrassed as a scientist?

234
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,560
If my sister found out about this, don't you think she'd be traumatized?

235
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,100
In that aspect,

236
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,060
I have no other words to say.

237
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,590
Tiny crabs...

238
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,250
I'll let you go until the testing's done.

239
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,240
If you don't change AG-3's face afterwards, I'm going to sue you.

240
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,720
Okay.

241
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,930
They're going to have a hard time trying to catch them all.

242
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,580
So rotten.

243
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,140
- Grab it!
 - Take it!!

244
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,870
I stepped on it. I stepped on it!

245
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,460
Here! Put those in the bag!!

246
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,360
I'm sorry, guys...

247
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:13,570
I don't want to hurt my sister. Never. Not even if the sky falls down.

248
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,550
We have to keep this a secret from Ji Ah.

249
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,390
I will try my best.

250
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,050
I have one last thing I'm curious about.

251
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,400
Please speak.

252
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,850
My wife told me that my sister really liked you.

253
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:34,290
That all day, over and over, she would only talk about you. That it was hard for her after the breakup.

254
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,670
Just what did you do to my sister back then?

255
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,680
Just what did you do to make her have such a hard time?

256
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,060
As her brother, I really want to ask this.

257
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:53,670
I also want to know. It seems like that is an answer I will have to find out going forward.

258
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,580
Are these robots, too?

259
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,700
I think the recipe that you found is quite good.

260
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,420
I think being a house husband works well for you, Master.

261
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,070
I can't eat food made by others, so I have to cook myself.

262
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,770
Can you really not eat at a restaurant?

263
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,730
No.

264
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,950
Since when?

265
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,810
Well, since 15 years ago?

266
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,950
Then what did you eat to survive all this time?

267
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:54,280
Well... At first, milk, cup ramen, then ramen.

268
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Then I tried rice porridge.

269
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,520
Then I tried soups and stews but only succeeded once every ten or so times.

270
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,390
After trying one after another, I was able to learn pretty fast.

271
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:40,370
Do you know that taste is a memory?

272
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,670
I grew up with my mom's homemade food.

273
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,910
Since I practiced really hard, I was able to come close to how my mom's cooking tasted

274
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,590
with the memory that's engraved on my tongue.

275
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:03,340
However, I wasn't able to learn things I should've from my father.

276
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,080
For example, shaving?

277
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,510

305
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:02,300
♫  These worries of mine are from my love  ♫

306
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,950
♫  Hoping you will come to me  ♫

307
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,010
♫  As much as I can't open my eyes  ♫

308
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:18,320
♫  As much as I shake, that is how much I love you  ♫

309
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,580
♫  Again today  ♫

310
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,320
 I Am Not a Robot 

311
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,370
 That crazy lunatic! He finally-- 

312
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,400
 Something came up, Sunbae. Something terrible. 

313
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,400
 I don't care about that. This is a great opportunity for us. You know what to do, right? 

314
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,330
 We're going to walk into that crowd, too. I'll make you feel great today. 

315
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,130
 I'm all better. I think I'm all better. 

316
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,010
 What do you think will happen if he finds out I'm really not a robot? 

317
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,420
 You were by my side. 

318
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,700
♫  And I love you   ♫
