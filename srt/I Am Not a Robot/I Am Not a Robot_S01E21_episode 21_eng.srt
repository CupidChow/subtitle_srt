1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,460
   

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,070
What do you think about the design for this one?

3
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:42,600


4
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,580
I think we have something to say to each other, don't we?

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,320
Should I say it first?

6
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,860
I like the apple tea from this cafe.

7
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,990
I like mugwort more than roses.

8
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,690
And I like winter more than summer.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,600
I thought I knew myself so well, but that wasn't true after all.

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,010
As a person goes through certain situations with people,

11
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,030
he learns more about his real self.

12
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,790
I agree with you.

13
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,160
I am not as much of a shallow materialistic person as I thought I was.

14
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm a bit flustered about this.

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,290
But that's me, too. So I'm going to accept who I am.

16
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,670
So I

17
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,640
won't be able to be with you, Kim Min Kyu.

18
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,450
That was pretty cool, Ye Ri El.

19
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,870
I will try to convince my dad at the right time.

20
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,110
Also, there won't be any changes with your friendship share.

21
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,620
Since my dad does acknowledge your skills when it comes to your work.

22
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,780
The problem is me.

23
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,340
It won't be easy since this is my first time disobeying my father,

24
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,560
but it's not like I will be kicked out. Right?

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,750
Just use me as an excuse for this.

26
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,580
That's okay.

27
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,550
I have to go through something like this at least once in my life.

28
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,010
I have one thing that I actually feel sorry towards you for.

29
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,500
The birthday cards that you have received over the last 15 years,

30
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,460
I wasn't the one who sent those.

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,510
I'm sorry. My father overstepped his bounds way too much.

32
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,890
Did you already know about it?

33
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,870
Whether you were the one that sent those or not,

34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,070
at those moments when I received them,

35
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,570
I was truly happy.

36
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,810
As much as I was happy at those times,

37
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,930
I'm thankful.

38
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,690
Why do you have to act so cool when we are ending it? You're making me feel sad now.

39
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,630
But you have changed a lot I must say.

40
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,190
How so?

41
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,370
In the past when I was sitting with you like this,

42
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,600
I wondered what I should talk about with you.

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,660
But now you're a friend that I want to have a drink with.

44
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,040
If you would like to drink with me, just give me a call anytime.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,630
That I won't be able to receive that necklace from you, that is one thing I'm sad about.

46
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,410
I'm sure it will find a good owner, right?

47
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,680
Yes, have you arrived?

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,790
Yes, I'm currently in Daegu right now. The agreement ceremony is going as we planned.

49
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,970
 But you're not coming in a car? 

50
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,240
No, I just thought it would be nice to get some fresh air since it's been a long time.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,380
I wanted to see the people around me as I went, too.

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
You don't need to pick me up at the station. I'll just meet you at the center.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,180
 A meteor shower occurs when dust from comets or asteroids 

54
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,770
 comes in contact with the Earth's atmosphere and burns. 

55
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,310
 It's a great site where shooting stars fall down like rain, 

56
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,380
 which makes it appear to be raining. 

57
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,120
 This meteor shower that will occur is due to an asteroid that got sucked  

58
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,230
 into Earth's atmosphere and caught on fire. 

59
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,710
 This asteroid was discovered back in 1983 and since then 

60
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,170
 has approached the Earth even closer than ever before. 

61
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,110
Hey, Hong Joo. I'm about to board the train.

62
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,910
I'll call when I reach Goejo Island.

63
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,870
♫  Please don't have a frowny face.  ♫

64
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,500
Hey, Sun Hye. I'm about to board the train.

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,870
It's not like I'm leaving the country. Why is everyone calling me?

66
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,090
Hang up, I'll call when I get there.

67
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,730
We're here for co-co-coffee.

68
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,660
- Get out.
 - Yes, sir.

69
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,550
Sun Hye, is Ji Ah better?

70
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,290
Is she eating well?

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,850
How many cups of coffee?

72
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,750
Seven cups, please, since we will be having guests at our lab today.

73
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,170
Seven. It's a deal since it's a lucky number.

74
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,980
Is Kim Min Kyu okay?

75
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,390
- Would he be? 
 - Would he be?

76
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,820
He noticeably withers away each day.

77
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,750
There is no way they will run into each other

78
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,820
or something, will they?

79
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,820
Ji Ah will be hiding on Geoje Island and then will take off to Australia, okay?

80
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,140
That will never happen even if the sky splits into two.

81
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,200
What if they still run into each other anyway?

82
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,410
Then they're destined to split the sky in half.

83
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:19,480
♫  I have been in pain for a few days  ♫

84
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,310
♫  Because my heart is overwhelmed by you  ♫

85
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,100
♫  Breathing  ♫

86
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,130
♫  And falling asleep are hard  ♫

87
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,180
♫  Even though I'm next to you  ♫

88
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,700
♫  My heart   ♫

89
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,830
♫  My heart can't be next to you  ♫
   

90
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,650
♫  I will always just long for you  ♫

91
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,130
♫  And that longing  ♫

92
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,700
♫  Has become tears again today  ♫

93
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,320
 We will soon arrive in Dongdaegu. 

94
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,560
 The door will open on your right. Thank you. 

95
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,710
♫  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  ♫

96
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,530
♫  Repeating over and over  ♫

97
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,950
♫  The words of my heart  ♫

98
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,620
Excuse me. These are our seats.

99
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,280
♫  No matter how much I yell  ♫

100
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,840
♫  It doesn't seem like you can hear  ♫

101
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,620
♫  Every day, only in my heart  ♫
   

102
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,420
♫  And only with my eyes  ♫

103
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,530
♫  I could say  ♫

104
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,530
♫  The words of love for you  ♫

105
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,290
I'm relieved.

106
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,990
What?

107
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,680
How did you come up with AG-3's face?

108
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,280
I had a character model

109
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,700
for the face, personality, habits, etc.

110
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,170
I hired someone suitable as a part-time worker.

111
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,560
I can't reach that person now.

112
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,700
But... why are you asking about that so suddenly?

113
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,620
I just suddenly got curious.

114
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,320
Then...

115
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:18,220
I guess I could, one day, cross paths with that person at least once.

116
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,630
That's possible.

117
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,390
But even if you meet her, it would be best to pretend to not know her.

118
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,600
You could end up looking like a really strange guy.

119
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,330
Okay, I'll do that.

120
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,090
 The caller that you're trying to reach is unavailable. 

121
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,220
I really can't reach her.

122
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,260
Hello, Doctor Hong.

123
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,230
Hello.

124
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,210
Yes, yes, Team Leader Jo.

125
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:51,400
I... Um, something came up, so I can't make it.

126
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,120
What happened? Is it serious?

127
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,270
Yes, I'm not exactly in my right mind.

128
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,310
Chairman Kim. Chairman Kim, are you okay?

129
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,170
Yes. Please wrap up well for me.

130
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,670
Who is this woman?

131
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,480
Yes, it's AG-3.

132
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,970
So this woman is a robot?

133
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,450
Yes, that's right. That AG-3 has been switching to different wigs and stuff.

134
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,090
I saw her commuting to work from Team Leader Jo Jin  Bae's house with both of these eyes...

135
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,820
I mean, we captured it with these four eyes.

136
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,270
So before, AG-3 ate some ice cream?

137
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,030
Yes, it's an incredibly high-tech robot, I'd say.

138
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,290
This is enough reason to receive the rest of our pay,

139
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,160
don't you think so?

140
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,600
Is this woman AG-3 as well?

141
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,570
No, could she be a human instead of a robot?

142
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,210
Oh, her?

143
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,660
She's a model for AG-3's character.

144
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,710
In order for me to make a robot with a face that resembles a human, I hired an actual person as a model.

145
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,680
So you're saying that she is AG-3's model?

146
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,630
Is there a problem?

147
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,470
Of course, there isn't.

148
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,680
But the robot that Chairman Kim Min Kyu met,

149
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,720
is she AG-3 or this woman?

150
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,160
I have no idea that you're saying.

151
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,880
You should know what I'm talking about.

152
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,080
I will get going if you don't have anything else to say.

153
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,430
You will have something to say soon enough.

154
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,600
Give me a call at any time.

155
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,250
I sure will.

156
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,040
What the hell is this folder?

157
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,950
Hey, Ssanip, did you make this folder?

158
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,670
- It wasn't me. 
 - This little...

159
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,040
This one.

160
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,880
It looks like a folder containing data that is too ambiguous to delete just yet.

161
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,960
Then it must be Hoktal. We don't have enough memory right now so tell him to take a look at it then delete it.

162
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,620
Okay. By the way, when is the design team going to be here?

163
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,870
Team Leader Jo said that they will come today.

164
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,280
He said that they need to measure equipment that will be going into the new lab so that they can set it up.

165
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,550
- Who is it? 
 - We are from KM Financial design team.

166
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,380
They're here. Yes, coming!!

167
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,810
They are here! They are here!

168
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,690
Hello. Hello.

169
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,810
Hello, welcome.

170
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,900
You've come earlier than expected.

171
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,650
- It's because our task before this ended earlier than expected. 
- Should I help you with something?

172
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,610
That's okay since we are professionals and all.

173
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,820
Oh, is that right?

174
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,130
It seems like it's not aligning very well. I can help with it a little.

175
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,080
- I'm not lying, I'm really okay. 
- It's okay.

176
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,460
It's fine for me as well. I really like doing this kind of stuff.

177
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,560
Is there anything else I can help you with?

178
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,710
- I'm good.
 - Oh, okay.

179
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,830
- That's all wrinkled up. 
- Oh it is?

180
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,710
You shouldn't be doing it that way, right?

181
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,670
- You're so good.
 - Yes, thank you.

182
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,760
Who are you?
   

183
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,130
AG-3.

184
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,450
Do you know me?

185
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,200
I also want to get to know you, too.

186
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,470
I cannot allow your unrequited stare that's full of interest.

187
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,190
No mindless touching. No, no, no.

188
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,750
She is very sensitive, you know. That's right.

189
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,630
How am I supposed to block your stares?

190
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Hoktal! Come here and check this out!

191
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,140
Okay!

192
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,770
   

193
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,610
- We have planted a virus!
 - That's so awesome!

194
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,070
Go find the password.

195
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,440
We have succeeded.

196
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,210
- Thank you. 
- Yes, thank you.

197
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,320
   

198
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,860
She should be arriving soon.

199
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,780
Grandma, just let her do anything she wants, please.

200
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,520
Don't ask her anything either.

201
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,980
Feed her when she says she's hungry.  And when she wants to work let her do that.

202
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,700
I know what you're saying.

203
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,390
I guess she won't be able to become like a nobleman.  She's here so I'm hanging up.

204
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,730
Grandma!

205
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,050
Let's take a look here!

206
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,020
Your face shrunk in half.

207
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,820
I went on a diet. Don't I look super pretty now?

208
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,110
I wonder what I'm going to do if I become even prettier than this?

209
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,280
To me, my granddaughter Hong Joo is prettier.

210
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,170
You should know that you met a really good sister-in-law.

211
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,260
Grandma, you have no idea how scary Hong Joo becomes once she gets angry.

212
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,130
So that's why at the most crucial moment everyone just bows their heads in front of her.

213
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,870
It's because she took after me.

214
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,980
All right, let's say that is the case.

215
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,480
Here, present for you.

216
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,150
Again? You spent money on something unnecessary again.

217
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,260
It's my money I spent so don't feel so bad.

218
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,410
So all you have to do is enjoy using the product. Okay, Grandma?

219
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,100
Why are you putting the apron on?

220
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,240
I should get to work.

221
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,120
You barely got here so why get to work?

222
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,200
You're not going to give me my daily pay, huh? I was planning to receive my wage from you today.

223
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,280
Since when has she been so into money?

224
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,990
 I had a character model 

225
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,710
 for the face, personality, habits, etc. 

226
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,810
 I hired someone suitable as a part-time worker. 

227
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,910
Hey, Captain Park.

228
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,540
If you caught fish, you should hurry up and bring them over here instead of calling me.

229
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,990
Please bring them to me.

230
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,380
There's nobody here.

231
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,890
The boat is coming in?

232
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,840
Yeah. We have some guests that have made reservations for tomorrow.

233
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,900
So that's why I asked Captain Park to catch some fish for sashimi.

234
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,380
- But that stupid old man—
 - I will go.

235
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,760
I'll be back in a jiffy!

236
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,850
My goodness, she's come here to empty her head instead of making money.

237
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,330
   

238
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,210
Oh, Hong Joo's is here. Come here!

239
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,160
Captain Park's boat hasn't arrived yet, right?

240
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,000
Long time no see by the way. He will arrive very soon.

241
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,720
So, will you be working here all winter long?

242
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,470
No, I will be going to Australia.

243
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,600
- Australia?! 
- Do you know how to speak English?

244
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,210
Of course, I do! My English is really great!

245
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,020
Would you like to hear it?

246
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,580
Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too.

247
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,520
I have no idea what she's saying at all.

248
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,400
She's so good. There is nothing she can't do.

249
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,810
It's quite all right, she's so good.

250
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,870
- She's good at everything! 
- Must be nice!

251
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,230
She is so great!

252
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,960
It's a cat.

253
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,480
- What English words can you say? 
- Oh, why?!

254
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,500
I do know!

255
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,990
Hello, kitty.

256
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,290
You like it here because there's plenty of food, right?

257
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,910
But what are you doing here by yourself without any friends?

258
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,120
It's ca— Mast— Ca—

259
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,770
You're reminding me of someone...

260
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,730
Hong Joo's, the boat is coming!

261
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,490
Oh, it's coming! It's coming right now!

262
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,860
Didn't even know.

263
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,800
Over here! Hurry up and come in this way!

264
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,160
Hello!

265
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,400
Hey, it's Hong Joo's!

266
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,690
I brought you some bread that you like, Captain.

267
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,730
Eat this as a snack while you're on the boat.

268
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,000
You always bring me something whenever you come here. You are so lovely.

269
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,960
Please give me the best product since I'm so lovely and all.

270
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,090
Oh, okay! For Hong Joo's,

271
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,440
I already put some fish aside for you. Hurry up and bring them over here!

272
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,990
Captain, you are the best!

273
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,720
Yeah, I'm the best! Hurry up and bring them here.

274
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,950
Man, it's very heavy.

275
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,910
- Here you are, take it. 
- Thank you!

276
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,710
They look good!

277
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,810
Thank you.

278
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,750
I'm off now!

279
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,020
- Be safe!
 - I will!

280
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,150
Please follow her.

281
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,050
Grandma!

282
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,150
Thank you.

283
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,490
You know me, right?

284
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,280
No, I don't.

285
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:18,700
We were on the same train though.

286
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:28,240
Oh, right. Yes, we were on the same, sitting across from each other. Right?

287
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,990
Yes, I do remember that. But what about it?

288
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,110
Could you give me a bit of your time?

289
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,070
Why?

290
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,280
I have something to talk to you about.

291
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,950
Talk about what?

292
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,660
That...

293
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm sorry, but I think it'll be difficult for me to make time for you.

294
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,290
I'm a part-timer here and as you can see, we are super busy.

295
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,670
And also, oh, if I get caught mucking around with the customer by the owner,

296
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,690
I can kiss my wage for the day goodbye!

297
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,070
I'll wait. Until you're done.

298
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,690
Sun Hye, that person is here right now. What do I do?

299
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,220
Wow, the sky's cracked into two, after all.

300
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,550
What?

301
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,980
What is Kim Min Kyu doing right now?

302
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,360
I'm in the kitchen right now and he's out sitting in the dining hall without any sign of moving.

303
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,270
I think I'm going to suffocate to death. What do I do?

304
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,810
Breathe in and out. Now listen carefully.

305
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,150
Today, you saw Kim Min Kyu for the first time ever.

306
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,520
When a strange man you've seen for the first time does that to you, what do we do?

307
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,600
Ignore completely.

308
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,980
That's right!

309
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,460
But what if he still clings on?

310
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,990
Then you treat him like he's crazy.

311
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,090
Let's go now.

312
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,820
I had a good meal.

313
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,290
Goodbye.

314
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,250
Look here, I get that we sat across each other.

315
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,460
But to follow me all the way here is really weird.

316
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,820
You are aware, too, right? That you're not normal?

317
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,720
Based on your expression, it doesn't seem like a coincidence.

318
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,490
So did you follow me here from the train?

319
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,960
By chance, you've fallen for me?

320
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,600
I mean, even if you've fallen for me, it's not like you're some stalker.

321
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,510
To come to someone's workplace and do this is really rude.

322
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,320
I'm not interested in you and you're not my type either.

323
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,590
Could you leave now?

324
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,490
If you keep doing this, I will really call the cops.

325
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,260
Combination sashimi.

326
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,300
You're not leaving?

327
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,120
I'm a bit hungry.

328
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,690
This isn't the only sushi fish place around here.

329
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,880
But this is the only sushi place where I want to eat.

330
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:17,010
By chance, is your name Hong Joo?

331
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,790
Hong Joo? Hong Joo.

332
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,810
I'll wait, Hong Joo.

333
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,970
Who is that?

334
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,840
I don't know him.

335
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,390
- Shall I call the police?
 - Oh, no!

336
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,020
But isn't he causing you distress?

337
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,390
I'm the one distressing him.

338
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,420
I get it. So it's him!

339
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,470
The one who is preventing you from eating and causing you to only work.

340
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,720
   

341
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:12,460
 Your call cannot be reached. 

342
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,700
 This is Jo Ji Ah. I'm on Geoje Island.  

343
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,580
 Kim Min Kyu is here! 

344
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,070
 He hasn't caught on but what do I do now?  

345
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,430
Pi, analyze the virus pattern and quarantine it.

346
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,560
Hoktal, find the source, and trace it back.

347
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Ssanip, check if there are any files that were leaked.

348
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,830
Yes, Doctor.

349
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:38,000
Which freaking punks got the giant nerve to plant a virus on our main hard drive?

350
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,500
- What was the date of planting? 
- It was today.

351
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,340
So it's externally or internally. Besides us, who else entered here today?

352
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,330
The design team?

353
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,250
Damn it, we can't let any one of the files leak.

354
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,050
Each and every single one of the files contain AG-3 technology. Do whatever it takes to shield them.

355
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,330
Yes, Doctor.

356
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,120
   
  

357
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,500
   

358
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,140
Got you, punk.

359
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,960
Backtracking was successful. It's a lot.

360
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,620
- Send the virus to the source. Kill them all. 
 - Okay.

361
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,890
What do you take us for?

362
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,170
Eat shit, you punks. Assholes.

363
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,800
I quit, I quit!

364
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,140
Hey, where are you going?

365
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,950
What the heck is this?!

366
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,680
Check the backups for any leaks, too.

367
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,120
Yes, I've checked.

368
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,240
Perfect, clear.

369
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,030
I understand.

370
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,890
Someone lied saying he was Team Leader Jo and postponed the design team's visit.

371
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,480
And they hired a hacker to attack us. Who was it? Who?

372
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,380
I think I know who it is.

373
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,780
What? Who?

374
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:04,440
 Even now, you'll obviously turn a blind eye to whatever your father does. 

375
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:11,520
  So, just like how you've been doing it until now, pretend you don't know and move aside. 

376
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,400
What are you doing?

377
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,320
What else? I came to drink with you.

378
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,890
Is this pity?

379
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,930
You still don't get me. I have no talent for such things.

380
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,180
- Just go. 
 - CEO Hwang.

381
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,570
So it's not pity, but mockery then.

382
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,990
You're pretty badly twisted.

383
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:54,390
Just how shameful I am and just how materialistic you are,

384
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,230
let's see it till the end.

385
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,530
I'm also curious what's there.

386
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,770
That's enough. Go further and my pride will be hurt.

387
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:10,230
If I drag Kim Min Kyu down, then Director Ye Seong Tae would send you to me. Right?

388
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,200
Hey, Hwang Yoo Cheol, will you even treat me like some item that gets traded?

389
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,330
So how come Kim Min Kyu is okay but not me?

390
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,800
How am I so different from him?

391
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,390
You want me to tell you?

392
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,400
Kim Min Kyu at least keeps his class in whatever situation he's in.

393
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,700
He doesn't show his rock bottom self like you. Got it?

394
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,610
Ye Ri El.

395
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:51,350
Once you have Chairman Kim Min Kyu as your son-in-law, you're all set. Right?

396
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,620
 You needn't come out. 

397
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,090
 Yes. 

398
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,830
Did you meet Min Kyu?

399
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,830
I met Yoo Cheol.

400
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,150
I mean, Mr. Hwang Do Hwan is the president, right?

401
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,810
So why would Yoo Cheol get kicked out?

402
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:24,090
This ruckus all started when President Hwang tried to push Min Kyu out to put Yoo Cheol in the chairman seat.

403
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,460
He would have received an enormous sum in rebates and bought stocks under borrowed names using that money.

404
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,220
But that's Mr. Hwang Do Hwan's fault. Yoo Cheol has no fault.

405
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,820
Not knowing is his fault, as a company representative.

406
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,830
It's not fair and it's not clear either. It's really not my style.

407
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,260
But Kim Min Kyu is fair and clear.

408
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,410
I can't kiss him, Dad!

409
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,790
I switched the engagement venue to a bigger place since a lot of people want to come.

410
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:59,790
So you can turn my engagement into your debut as a boss of KM Financial?

411
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,710
But you would become the chairman's wife in exchange.

412
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,690
  We failed. I apologize. 

413
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,030
Who are you?

414
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,620
Assemble!

415
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,980
Head butt!

416
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Hey.

417
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,590
Kid, look at me for a second.

418
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,280
I don't know what happened.

419
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,370
But you shouldn't push someone who is so desperate.

420
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,500
What is it that you want to talk to me about?
