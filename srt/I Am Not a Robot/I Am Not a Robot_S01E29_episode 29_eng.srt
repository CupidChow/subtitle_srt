1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,670


2
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,500
Ji Ah, I've been peeling this continuously, but it just won't end.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,150
You already peeled the skin off. Why are you trying to peel more?

4
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,600
Now you have to cut this in half and then into little pieces.

5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,970
There's no egg!

6
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,710
Look in the other refrigerator next to it.

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,710
- I'll do it. Move out.
 - No, I can do it.

8
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,420
This should be like—

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,260
Please move! You're confusing me.

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,810
I can do it.

11
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,650
- Watch the food. 
- Hey this.

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,900
It's burning.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,320
- Just move.
 - That's not how you do it.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,250
You're here?

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:15,140
They said they had something to tell you, so... Is it all right?

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,610
I think we will be done moving things out by tomorrow.

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,020
I asked if we could eat together for one last time since we won't have any reason to see each other in the future.

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,800
We made the food together today.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,080
Make sure to clean everything well when you leave.

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,630
Since there's no reason to see each other again.

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,090
Oh. Okay.

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,490
We'll clean everything with bleach before we leave.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,450
 I think we will be done moving things out by tomorrow. 

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,240
 I asked if we could eat together for one last time since we won't have any reason to see each other in the future. 

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,590
He said it so easily.

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,450
I mean, are those words that easy to say?

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,140
I can finally eat too now.

28
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,940
That's right.

29
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,560
Try this. I made it at home.

30
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,340
How is it?

31
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,070
It's delicious.

32
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,640
That must mean it's really delicious.

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,750
Since when did you start cooking?

34
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,920
It hasn't been that many days yet.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
I think I ate too much.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,490
Is it not good?

37
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,450
- Are you sure it's delicious?
 - Yeah.

38
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,820
However, from now on, I'll be in charge of cooking.

39
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,390
Why? What is it?

40
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,200
- It's delicious. You should try some.
 - I don't eat meat.

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,330
- Since when? 
- Yeah, right.

42
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,390
- I don't think that was the case yesterday.
 - Since when?

43
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,450
Just don't cook anymore. It's better for you to do it.

44
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,750
Is your body better, Brother?

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,070
It's getting better.

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,280
Since we're all sitting together like this,

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,410
it reminds me of the first day he invited us over.

48
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,020
I miss that. I miss that.

49
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,200
I don't remember when that was.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,840
Kim Min Kyu invited people over for a meal together?

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
Ah, about that... You know when we told him we were going to take AG-3 away?

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,860
He got so scared that he made an obscene amount of food and invited us to try to persuade us.

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,360
What do you think he called us when we were with him at that time?

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,620
Researcher One.

55
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,380
- Two.
- Three.

56
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,350
It's not like he was talking about three strikes.

57
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,860
That's was a big step in your stand, Kim Min Kyu.

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,210
It's all because I told you to do so, right?

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,930
The food he made was really good.

60
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,260
It was extremely delicious.

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,050
So what if it was delicious? You ignored me.

62
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,680
♫  I don’t wanna let you go away  ♫

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,270
We're giving Beetle to you as a present.

64
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,750
Why are you giving it to me?

65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,120
No, it's just... We don't know when we will get to see each other again.

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,160
We might never see each other again, either.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,820
When I was thinking about things, I realized that we received from you but we haven't really given you anything.

68
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,180
However, you have a lot of money and everything.

69
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,010
That's why we thought Beetle would be the best present to give you.

70
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,430
It can befriend Lovely, too.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,190
We also upgraded it yesterday.

72
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,140
The battery life is longer and it has more facial expressions.

73
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,290
Although it won't be as good as AG-3, it will be able to keep you company when you're bored.

74
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,660
I'm really, really sorry, Brother.

75
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:27,290
When we leave, I hope you forget all the bad times and just remember the good times.

76
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,590
But if you don't even want that, you can forget everything.

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,650
I don't want it.

78
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,010
About what?

79
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,900
You don't want Beetle?

80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,910
No, what am I supposed to do when it breaks down?

81
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,590
What should I do fix it? I don't know anything.

82
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,950
Do you want me to just throw it away at a junk shop or something?

83
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,760
Junk shop...

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,850
I think we're all done eating, so let's get up, Doctor.

85
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,260
Just stay here.

86
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,360
What?

87
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,520
I'm telling you to just stay here.

88
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,230
It's so cold, so why do you keep wanting to go out?

89
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,010
Just stay at my house.

90
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,020
It's really cold. I heard it has been the coldest weather of all time.

91
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,570
Then could you get me another bowl of rice, Ji Ah?

92
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,990
How about we have a can of beer, Brother?

93
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,460
I have another one of those we had that time. The purebred chicken. The one with a leg this big. The huge one.

94
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,530
You still have that?

95
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,970
You have chicken? It's not like you breed chicken.

96
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,140
Okay. Then,

97
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,860
- we should eat some of it.  
- A chicken coop.

98
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,930
Do you breed chicken or what?

99
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,990
 I love you. 

100
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:30,010
 Yeah, you will be a military robot. The world's most dangerous weapon. 

101
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,190
 Am I not supposed to live with humans? 

102
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,680
 You're just a product own by a man. 

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,890
 This man. 

104
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,100
 You do not exist as a living creature. 

105
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,530
 Hi, AG-3. 

106
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,430
 I'm currently on master mode. 

107
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,990
 - Friend mode?
 - Did you call me? 

108
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,080
 It works. It's working. 

109
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,810
 We're friends now, AG-3. 

110
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,080
 No, that's not right. We're family.  

111
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,230
 Remember this, AG-3. 

112
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,510
 You will be able to live with humans as a friend and as family. 

113
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,390
 I am that kind of an existence? 

114
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,300
 That's right. So let's work well together. 

115
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,890
I'm sorry, AG-3.

116
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,980
I'm sorry, AG-3...

117
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,320
Sleep some more.

118
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,220
What is it?

119
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,700
I... like it when you're looking at me.

120
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,500
However, right now you seem sad.

121
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,130
That's not it. I'm happy right now.

122
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:25,690
Kim Min Kyu. Input my face and my emotions right now.

123
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,130
When you're like this, I get upset.

124
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,360
That's right.

125
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm sad.

126
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,950
I found you,

127
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,750
but Santa Maria lost AG-3.

128
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,750
So I'm sad.

129
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,720
♫  Even if it's unfortunate  ♫

130
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:16,700
♫  Giving my heart, why is it so hard for me?  ♫

131
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,190
I know even if others don't.

132
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,750
♫  Even someone like me loves  ♫

133
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,880
That you did everything you could

134
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,390
to protect her.

135
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,720
♫  It's very weird  ♫

136
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,990
♫  Loving with all of your heart  ♫

137
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,400
Will you remember this one thing?

138
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
♫  How  ♫

139
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,020
Wherever you are

140
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,240
♫  What kind of person can do it?  ♫

141
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,740
I will always be by your side.

142
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:59,120
♫  It really doesn't work out well for me even though I try  ♫

143
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,050
♫  Like you before, I want to love like that  ♫

144
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,920
You did well.

145
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:29,710


146
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,580
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,780
Just cry.

148
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,700
You're more upset than I am.

149
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,810
There's no such thing.

150
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,120
Your heart probably hurts more.

151
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,970
We still have time until the contract signing,

152
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,090
so I should look for a way until the very end. Right?

153
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,830
Now this sounds more like Kim Min Kyu.

154
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,570
Let's see...

155
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,820
   

156
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,050
   

157
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,850
   

158
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,770
I... I think I found a way to get AG-3 back.

159
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,270
What is it? Are you amazed again since I'm even driving?

160
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,190
That's right. It's amazing.

161
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,000
How can they just go into the lane without turning on their blinkers—

162
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,790
Did your heart flutter?

163
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,180
Ah! You can't disturb the driver.

164
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,980


165
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,010
- Come back safely. 
- I'll be back.

166
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,120
Welcome.

167
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,150
Hello, Kim Min Kyu.

168
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,350
Madam-X?

169
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,060
I came here after getting a message from Madam-X.

170
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,730
Chairman Martin is a criminal on Interpol's blacklist.

171
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,130
Murder, fraud, and instigating arson.

172
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,480
Although he committed countless crimes,

173
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,230
he was always freed as innocent because there wasn't enough evidence against him.

174
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,770
If Jang Doo Sam's recording has anything that deals with Chairman Martin,

175
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,450
we can contact Interpol and put him in a witness protection program.

176
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,720
We're just going to take a look once and then leave, okay?

177
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,750
Thank you, Uncle.

178
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,540
I won't leave until I see her.

179
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,150
I'll wait.

180
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,830
In this spot. I will see her no matter what.

181
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,290
- I w— 
- I know. I already told you many times that I know again and again.

182
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,990
We're trying to see her right now.

183
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,430
How many times do you have to say it?

184
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,570
I'll wait.

185
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,290
It seems that Jang Doo Sam disappeared on the day Doctor Hong and I met him.

186
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,720
I sent a text, but I can't guarantee that he'll come.

187
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,820
You said two o'clock, right? There's not much time left.

188
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,590
However, since when did my younger sister get a job as your personal driver?

189
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:30,170
Uhm... That... I apologize.

190
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,440
Jang Doo Sam!

191
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,970
Please sit.

192
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,810
Just how are you going to keep me safe?

193
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,110
You'll be protected by Interpol's witness protection program.

194
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,220
Here. There is information along with where you can stay.

195
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:11,350
I know very well about how you have lived until now.

196
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,280
Without being able to trust anyone and always doubting whether or not the person in front of you is going to hurt you.

197
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,460
Not wanting to live like that, but not being able to see any other path.

198
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,270
I know very well what that feels like.

199
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,490
Please hold onto my hand, Jang Doo Sam.

200
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,180
I'll be that path for you.

201
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,630
This is Jang Doo Sam's recording that I told you about.

202
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,860
Would it be possible before 2 o'clock?

203
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,490
I beg that you take care of it well.

204
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,260
How did it go?

205
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,220
It was a success?

206
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,810
The only problem now is to get there before the signing ceremony.

207
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,250
Yes. I will call you immediately when I get there and find AG-3's location.

208
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,390
Don't worry. I'll get you there no matter what.

209
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,230
Oh... Okay.

210
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,670
   
  

211
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:44,800
We will begin signing the contract for the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&amp;D Team.

212
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,950
- Congratulations.
 - And to you. Shall we?

213
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,070
President Martin?

214
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,190
I'm afraid we cannot proceed the transaction of Team Santa Maria today.

215
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:08,020
Also, we are going to cancel all of our contracts with Bold Corporation.

216
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,450
Kim Min Kyu, everything's over already.

217
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,500
What are you doing right now?

218
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,840
 We just arrived, Chairman. 

219
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:30,340
That's right. Everything's over... for you.

220
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:39,900
Hwang Do Won, you're under arrest for the murder of Daeyang Shipbuilding's Chairman Park Sung Jin.

221
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,530
- What are they saying?
 - What's going on?
 Murder?

222
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,200
I think you will have to come with us to the police station to give a statement.

223
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
Let go. We refuse to go anywhere.

224
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,610
Mr. Martin.

225
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,580
Let's go.

226
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,280
It seems that things will get worse.

227
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,880
No. This is the end.

228
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:37,790


229
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,590
What the hell!

230
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,170
- What is it?
 - Martin came to take it, but AG-3 is missing.

231
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,930
Where in the world did AG-3 disappear?!

232
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,270
Yeah?

233
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,690
AG-3 disappeared?

234
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,720
Let's go home.

235
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,840
   

236
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,820
   

237
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,170
Shit! Damn it!

238
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,320
The police have gotten involved.

239
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,970
We need to leave the country immediately!

240
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,110
Those things that we discussed in front of the AG-3 last night.

241
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,600
  You have no idea what I had to go through to get the AG-3 here. 

242
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,300
  I killed that old bastard Park myself. 

243
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,670
We're gonna have to delete all of AG-3's data.

244
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,710
Make sure it's completely wiped! Are we clear on this?

245
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,600
If anything goes wrong, you'll be the one taking the fall!

246
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,130
What...

247
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,930
That miss must be so cold.

248
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,290
What is she wearing?

249
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:16,020
 I was crossing the street yesterday and everyone looked like trees to me.  

250
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,240
 It felt like I was walking in a forest. 

251
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,940
 Some trees were mystical.  

252
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,060
 Some trees, I wanted to touch.  

253
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,550
AG-3 went out on her own.

254
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,190
Just what is happening?

255
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,160
What? AG-3 walked out on her own?

256
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,780
She couldn't have gone far yet.

257
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,080
Ji Ah and Kim Min Kyu are looking around the area first.

258
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,380
It's crowded. Move over there.

259
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,420
This chair is for three people. It's not too tight.

260
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,440
It's tight for me!

261
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,720
You're not scared of me?

262
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,580
No matter how you look, you're a human, same as the others.

263
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,340
A human like the others?

264
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,880
Hey, grab my hand then.

265
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,890
What a pretty hand.

266
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,710
Aren't you cold? Where are you going in that?

267
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,140
I'm going home.

268
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,750
Where's home?

269
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,260
A place where family and friends are.

270
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,080
- Where's that though?
 - A place that can recharge me.

271
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,450
Don't wander around and quickly go before you end up like me.

272
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,090
What does it mean to end up like you?

273
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,140
Having no one to meet

274
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,220
and no one who is waiting for me.

275
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,770
No one's interested in me at all.

276
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:23,340
I am interested. What kind of a person are you, Mister?

277
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,930
Take this and take the bus.

278
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,490
You know how to take the bus, right?

279
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,060
Hurry and go. Your family must be worried.

280
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:02,120
Hurry and go. Don't disturb me.

281
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,130
President Hwang, are you going to keep this up?

282
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,640
 Did you cause Chairman Park's accident, President Hwang? 

283
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,820
 Remember this clearly. You know nothing.  

284
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,640
 That's how you and  

285
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,880
 your family can live.  

286
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,530
You still have nothing to say?

287
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,450
When my lawyer gets here, we'll talk then.

288
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,290
I'm leaving tonight.

289
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,500
Do everything you can to get the AG-3 back.

290
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,660
If you can't make it happen, destroy it.

291
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,850
I don't want anyone else getting their hands on it.

292
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,240
Listen, I know that Hwang acquired those shares illegally.

293
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,790
I was the one who gave him the money to do it.

294
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,280
Which means if you don't do what I tell you to do,

295
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,520
your father will be the one to get hurt.

296
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,700
We're all in this together, you know.

297
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:22,180
Is it true that my father killed Chairman Park Seong Jin like the detective said?

298
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,580
It's not true.

299
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,700
Then who was it?

300
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,990
Director Yoon!

301
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,380
It was Chairman Martin, but we don't have evidence.

302
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,530
President kept quiet about Martin's crime and got a rebate.

303
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,580
When Martin said earlier that we're all in the same boat, that's what he meant.

304
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,090
So my father committed collusion by keeping quiet?

305
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:55,480
Martin leaving Korea quickly and President getting released as innocent is the best scenario we can hope for.

306
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,320
For that, we absolutely need Director Ye on our side.

307
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,640
Only then, we can get rid of Chairman Kim Min Kyu.

308
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:13,120
Martin's side and President Hwang's side are probably all after her so we need to find her first no matter what.

309
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:20,150
I suddenly thought of this but why does it feel like AG-3 will go home?

310
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,800
I think I would think of home first if I were her.

311
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,100
   

312
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,790
 Seoul, Yongsan District Hoenamu Road 90-24 

313
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,270
Earlier, did you see a woman wearing pink?

314
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,460
   

315
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,840
I found out where AG-3 went. It's Chairman Kim Min Kyu's house.

316
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,120
Don't lose her. Get her no matter what.

317
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,170
It's all right if you break her, too.

318
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,410
You worked hard.

319
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,120
Here. Sit here. Mom will be behind you.

320
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,590
Thank you.

321
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,480
Pretty.

322
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,180
 In a moment, the bus... 

323
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,490
She took the bus a moment ago.

324
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,480
Dr. Hong? Not long ago, AG-3 took the bus.

325
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,570
So we end up leaving without seeing her?

326
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,100
We waited long enough.

327
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,220
You're not focused again. Drive properly!

328
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,860
Over there!

329
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,580
AG-3!

330
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,550
Hey, you won big time today.

331
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,190
AG-3!

332
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,060
AG-3, where are you going?

333
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,170
I'm going home.

334
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,360
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

335
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,570
Get in. Get in.

336
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,460
Get in.

337
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,080
Good.

338
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,060
Oh.

339
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,240
Get them out.

340
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,660
Open the door.

341
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,720
- Uncle, do you know them? 
- Open it. Hey! Open!

342
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,230
Open! Open!

343
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,940
Don't get scared.

344
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,740
- AG-3, we will protect you. 
- Open the door!

345
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,900
