1
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,930
- Yes, Doctor?
 - I will be sleeping here for tonight. I'll come back tomorrow morning.

2
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,910
 It's taking longer than I thought. 

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,710
I got it. Doctor said that he'll come back tomorrow morning.

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,480
In that case...

5
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,340
- Hurry and come!
 - Hey!

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,290
We're here to take AG-3.

7
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,620
Wait, wait! Wait a bit. The thing is...

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,310
If you guys didn't have dinner yet...

9
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,220
We already did.

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,420
They had it already.

11
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,890
Korean beef!  Steak! Abalone!

12
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,430
Seafood soup!  Lobster, too!

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,660
Sunbae, it's food. Let's eat then go since it's prepared.

14
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,510
Hey! Do you have enough food for all of us?

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:33,140
 Timing and Subtitles by The Robotic Team @ viki.com  

16
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,890
Seafood smell. Wow.

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,370
This is... wait.

18
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,050
- This...
- What's that?

19
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:51,370
That salted sea squirt is for our Masan native... Researcher 1.

20
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,040
And for Researcher 2, the one in front of you. That.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,200
That cheese dish is for Researcher 2, who studied abroad.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,010
And for our Researcher 3, sorry but I couldn't come up with anything. Sorry.

23
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,730
One, two, three? Oops.

24
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,480
Do you not know our names?

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,360
Well... do I need to?

26
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,690
Sea squirt? Well, it's the first time I've heard of it.

27
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,200
Even my grandpa wouldn't like this.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,070
Also, although my home town is Masan,

29
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,890
my flavor profile is that of Seoul.

30
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,580
For me as well, this isn't that great.

31
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,960
I ate this in the US every day when I didn't have money.

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,810
Then I'll just eat everything.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Why?

34
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,930
This kind of thing...

35
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,220
Amazing. This is amazingly good.

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,030
What? What?

37
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,570
I mean, how could you be this terrible at small talk even if you're not good at socializing and get complaints when you're the one who cooked?

38
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,630
Also, how can you just eat?

39
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,950
You said to cook for them!

40
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,360
You need to converse, so you can get closer. Once you're closer, you can ask for a favor.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,980
You should talk to them, naturally.

42
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,210
If they ask you questions, respond honestly.

43
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,350
Okay, I got it.

44
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:35,740
What do your parents do in America?

45
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,650
Laundromat. They're 1.5 generation immigrants.

46
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,340
What do your parents do?

47
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,890
They are lying in their burial grounds, side by side.

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,800
How did that happen?

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,820
Half of the car smashed into an oncoming truck.

50
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,240
It was crushed and bent. Only I survived.

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,940
Is it true that Hong Baek Gyun is looking for a new investor?

52
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,900
Yes, I am sure. Do you think he clashed with Chairman Kim Min Kyu?

53
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,760
No, that doesn't matter because this is a great chance for us.

54
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,610
You know what to do, right?

55
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,510
Yes. We started.

56
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,150
 Yes. 

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,350
 Thank you. 

58
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,200
This friend is the smartest one of my students.

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,250
His research attitude is excellent, too. I can vouch for that.

60
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,620
I will give you a drink.

61
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,030
They ate all my food. This is a sign that they'll hear me out, right?

62
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,880
It is now time.

63
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,940
Because you all ate well, I am happy.

64
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,040
Well, you know where else would you eat such great food, right?

65
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,970
Yes, I promise you that if you don't leave the house—

66
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,200
I think you made too much food for no reason.

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,480
I heard that if you leave food, you have to eat it all when you go to hell.

68
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,830
So I ate forcefully and my stomach is uncomfortable.

69
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,670
- Let's go.
 - Wait!  Wait a second.

70
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,410
It's not right to eat it all then pretend like nothing happened.

71
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,720
Did we ask for you to do this?

72
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,540
You guys are too much.

73
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,050
If you ate it all, it is common courtesy to wash the dishes.

74
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,250
Are you going to just leave?

75
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,780
Sunbae Hoktal washes the dishes really well.

76
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,710
Ssanip is good at organizing.

77
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,410
Unnie,

78
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,740
can we not actually leave?

79
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,640
After losing his parents like that, he lived in this huge house by himself.

80
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,950
He's not a weird person. He's just not experienced in everything.

81
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,540
He's sensitive on the inside.

82
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,110
If we stay a bit longer, you'll see that side of him.

83
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,180
It's done already. Doctor is meeting investors right now.

84
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:35,190
Then Unnie... When we leave later, can you just say that you ate well?

85
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,900
I just wish that today's ending isn't entirely bad for him.

86
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,820
No. If we are planning not to see each other again, it's best to end it badly.

87
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,020
Come to my room, AG-3.

88
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,690
I feel like I am going to throw up.

89
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,600
What do I need to do...

90
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,110
to change their hearts?

91
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,250
It's hard.

92
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,880
It's so hard.

93
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,130
♫  When meeting someone, ♫ 

94
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,000
♫  It doesn't seem like... ♫ 

95
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,180
You did well.

96
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,550
♫  One step, ♫ 

97
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,270
♫  You are there ♫ 

98
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,670
♫  so lovingly  ♫

99
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,290
♫  The matter of loving with all my heart  ♫

100
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,840
♫  What do I do? To that certain someone, ♫ 

101
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,050
Should we leave now?

102
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,870
I should at least go and beg them at their feet.

103
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,020
♫  It's not working well ♫ 

104
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,800
♫  Like you, ♫ 

105
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,480
♫  I want to love like that kind of person ♫ 

106
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,590
What are you doing right now?!

107
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,960
Lovely, are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

108
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,380
Why are you like this? What the?

109
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,230
Are you okay? Come back to your senses!

110
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,960
I saw it earlier and noticed it was broken.

111
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,480
We'll fix it for you. We can fix this kind of stuff with just one hand.

112
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,100
Just give it.

113
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,860
- Give it to us. Huh? Huh? 
- Let go.

114
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Really.

115
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,300
Here.

116
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,590
You're alive.

117
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,700
So happy to see you, Lovely.

118
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,260
Wow, there is a face now.

119
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,710
Since we were fixing it, we upgraded it a little.

120
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,850
If the filter is full of dust, it will cry and when it's clean, it will smile.

121
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,990
It came back.

122
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,210
I'm so relieved.

123
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,040
So he's not a pervert. He actually kisses robots.

124
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,900
I guess he originally was a good person.

125
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,870
I'm thirsty. I'm craving for some beer now.

126
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,710
I haven't used my brain in a while so I'm hungry.

127
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,270
Well...

128
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,440
Chicken. I have it.

129
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,380
A purebred chicken. The one with a huge leg.

130
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,050
The leg is super big, huh?

131
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,350
I want some drumsticks now.

132
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,840
No, you can't. If you eat a drumstick, you'll run away.

133
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,590
So annoying.

134
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,540
Then Sunbae, you eat the leg. It'll disappear.

135
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,620
It might run far far away.

136
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,240
No more. Don't speak about it anymore.

137
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,290
Hey, guys, I'm curious about something.

138
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,200
That money from earlier.

139
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,170
It is so hard for me to understand why you refused to accept it.

140
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,680
Do you know how much money that is?

141
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,890
You can go and  convince Doctor Hong.

142
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,600
It's because Doctor Hong has already made up his mind.

143
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,680
So faithful to him.

144
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,960
A person who can't trust anyone can't be trusted by others.

145
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,680
I don't know why those words popped into my head.

146
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,820
What's she saying?

147
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,870
I really want to eat chicken wings.

148
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,890
No! You'll fly away.

149
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,860
- I'm going to fly away. 
- I'm going to fly away.

150
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,600
- Yes, fly away. 
- You crazy fool.

151
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,800
Fly, fly.

152
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,040
Fly far away.

153
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm sorry. Yes.

154
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,020
Eat some wings and fly far, far away.

156
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,080
Fly so far away that you'll disappear from my eyes.

157
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,650
   

158
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,890
 I'm sorry. To them, someone 

159
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,190
 has leaked the information about what happened in the US. 

160
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,320
 I tried my best but I think it will be a bit difficult. 

161
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,090
Yes, hello.

162
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,360
This is he.

163
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,800
Investment?

164
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,490
AG-3?

165
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,820
What the heck? Where did everybody go?

166
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,630
Yes, Doctor.

167
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,600
We were on a walk and are about to head in right now.

168
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,170
Yes.

169
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,540
Miss Jo Ji Ah, say that we met up while you came to pick up your stuff, okay?

170
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,560
You absolutely can't tell him that we slept over at Baton's house, all right?

171
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,420
Hurry it up.

172
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,550
Hey!

173
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,100
Why are you coming in at the same time with them?

174
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,970
I'm here to pick up my bag.

175
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,070
- Oh, is that so? 
- We met right in front.

176
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,390
That's right.

177
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,160
All right, go get your bag then. Everyone, pay attention here!

178
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,750
We have a new investor.

179
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,820
Under the condition of taking AG-3 to them for a demonstration.

180
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,990
A perfect demo will be hard.

181
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,800
You should meet up with the investor once we stabilize the new part we added.

182
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,110
She just can't walk but the rest is possible to demonstrate.

183
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,090
We can take her in a wheelchair and convince the investor.

184
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,100
Hurry it up. We don't have much time.

185
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,830
All right, let's go!

186
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,390
Doctor Hong will park his full-sized van over here.

187
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,260
Before taking out AG-3,

188
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,880
tell him that you want to have a cup of tea with all of the team members.

189
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,520
- Then take them to the cafe on the first floor. 
 - And then?

190
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,570
Then I'll drive off with the full sized van that has AG-3.

191
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,770
You'll say that you need to go to the bathroom really badly to the point that your bladder's about to explode, then you just sneak out of there.

192
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,100
Then come to the front and I will pick you up.

193
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,890
What if someone wants to remain in the van?

194
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,970
Ow, that startled me!

195
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,330
 I investigated through our US branch and it looks like Doctor Hong has been defamed by one of his colleagues. 

196
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,220
 And he gave up the lawsuit under the condition that his team members will be protected. 

197
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,960
 Also, all of the research results have been handed over to that colleague. 

198
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,040
All right, thank you for your work.

199
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,550
 Before we disable the power cable, 

200
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,310
 should we take down the MODCC? 

201
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,250
 Hold on, let me double check. 

202
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,150
 Hoktal, go and check the NTS. 

203
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,690
 Okay. 

204
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,200
 NTS backup confirmation complete. 

205
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,260
 TPICP back up complete. 

206
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,310
 I will take care of this cable then. 

207
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,200
 - It's completed. 
- Shut off the power. 

208
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,660
 Okay, I'm shutting off the power now. 

209
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,020
Power off complete.

210
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,670
I'm going to take the power cable out now.

211
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,170
Wait for a moment.

212
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,120
I'll drop you off on our way.

213
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,090
 May I come in for a bit? 

214
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,810
We have a new investor now.

215
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,240
We will be able to vacate this place pretty soon.

216
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,790
What do you need to say to me?

217
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,240
I have to leave soon.

218
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:43,970
Doctor, now I understand why you're called the con-artist in the world of science.

219
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,480
KM's Massachusetts branch manager is best friends with Congressman Joo Sang Won.

220
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,190
So I was able to find out all the ins and outs of everything.

221
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,930
I ordered for a recovery of your reputation.

222
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,790
Who do you think you are?

223
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,000
Who the hell do you think you are to talk about recovering my reputation?

224
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,820
Because it was an unfair slander.

225
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,090
Whether it's defaming or whatever, my reputation is

226
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,220
something that I will fix on my own.

227
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,090
If you're here to tell me that kind of crap, then get lost right now.

228
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,830
Just like AG-3 said, I am

229
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,380
not very good with words.

230
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,460
What are you doing? Let go of me!

231
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,900
Help me, Big Brother.

232
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,040
 Just how amazing your work is, Doctor Hong, 

233
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,630
 let me explain it to you this way. 

234
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,700
 The robot that you created 

235
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,710
 has saved a person. 

236
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,700
Now that we're really leaving, I'm a bit disappointed.

237
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,240
Baton isn't a pervert.

238
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,190
Then don't we not have to leave?

239
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,340
Should I talk to Doctor Hong about this?

240
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,700
You still don't really know Doctor Hong's personality?

241
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,340
Whatever it may be, he's the type of person that sticks to it once he made the decision.

242
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,970
There won't be anything close to a swimming pool in the new research lab.

243
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,960
Not even a gymnasium.

244
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,090
It's almost time, Doctor.

245
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,230
The investor is waiting for you.

246
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,190
Let's go.

247
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,900
 I have taken the army medical exam four times already. 

248
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,720
 Because the medical field does not accept my illness saying it is an illness that doesn't exist in this world. 

249
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,150
 Of course, there is no treatment. 

250
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,170
 That is why whenever a new allergy medicine comes out in this world, I have it shipped 

251
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,890
 and experimented on my body. 

252
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,010
 I know people call me "Baton." 

253
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,810
 Nobody would ever think that it is a weapon to keep me alive. 

254
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,890
 That's how I lived for the past 15 years. 

255
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,340
 For the rest of my life, I was prepared to live like this. 

256
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:17,800
 However, a miracle occurred. 

257
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,630
 AG-3. 

258
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,990
I'm turning the car around.

259
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,970
Doctor?

260
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,710
- You don't have to do it if you don't want to. 
- I'll do it.

261
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,190
- If there is anything worrying you, then don't do it. 
- I'm doing it.

262
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,360
Answer after thinking carefully first.

263
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,920
Do you know it's the first time?

264
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,040
- What?
 - That you asked me first.

265
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,980
When did I not do that?

266
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,600
Anyway, thanks for many things.

267
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,120
I think we misunderstood Chairman Kim Min Kyu.

268
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,470
We cleared the misunderstanding, and he has promised to give 50 billion won.

269
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,380
There is really no reason to leave. I have decided to stay here again.

270
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,970
Pi, come see me for a second.

271
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:33,020
I am against your decision. Is it because of Jo Ji Ah?

272
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,510
Is it because you want to keep her by your side?

273
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,220
- It's not.
 - Then what is it really?

274
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,660
Baton has not caught us yet.

275
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,490
You know this is our last chance to make everything right.

276
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:49,780
If he finds out, he'll point you out as a con artist again. What will you do then?

277
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,820
The test results greatly exceeded our expectations.

278
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,700
Whatever that is... It was Jo Ji Ah's doing.

279
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,790
No. Chairman Kim Min Kyu believes she's a robot.

280
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,390
AG-3 has done it.

281
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:11,130
When the new part arrives and we fix it, AG-3 will step in.

282
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:18,540
Pi. I want to finish this test. We've accomplished a great thing.

283
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,110
That is the reason why we create robots.

284
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,390
Our plan fell apart.

285
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,480
Should I initiate plan B?

286
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes, I got it.

287
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,550
What did he say? Do they want us to return the money?

288
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,650
He said to bring it to him no matter what. This robot.

289
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,250
If you sign this agreement, after getting approval from KM's board of directors,

290
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,530
the research fund amount listed on the contract will be administered.

291
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,810
And the new research facility will be prepared after discussion.

292
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,920
Then should your Big Brother sign here?

293
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,720
Did you hear? He just said "your Big Brother."

294
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,060
We're the ones who drank with him. When did  they become so close?

295
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,780
You're the youngest here. Let's get our hierarchy straight.

296
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,900
Three Big Brother and one Big Sister. Wow, you're lucky.

297
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,780
- The thing is—
- Hi, Brother.

298
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,750
Nice to meet you, Little Brother.

299
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,150
So this is the feeling of having a rich little brother?

300
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,300
Mansour has older brothers, too. Right?

301
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,490
Why? Does it make you angry?

302
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,830
Also, there is the most important thing.

303
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,960
If you don't promise this, I won't sign these papers.

304
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:16,250
Promise me that you won't even lay a tip of your finger on AG-3. Or else, we'll leave.

305
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,170
Okay.

306
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,110
Wait a little bit, heart lamp. I will fix you like you're brand new.

307
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,900
The name of that is heart lamp?

308
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,830
Yes.

309
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,480
I can fix that for you. But in return, give me compensation.

310
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,120
How much?

311
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,130
I will tell you after I fix it?

312
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,630
What are you scheming?

313
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,650
If you don't want to, then never mind.

314
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,790
Fine then. You only need a day, right?

315
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,600
What? "Hi, Brother?"

316
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,210
"Nice to meet you, Little Brother? Mansour has older brothers" and what else?! Gosh these scheming jerks!

317
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,560
Just because I fed them once, they're  clinging on.

318
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,850
Then I will be heading out.

319
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,200
- Wait.
- Yes?

320
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,490
Find a person for me.

321
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,150
His name is Jang Doo San.

322
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,490
I received the message. What's the reason for me to look for him?

323
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,590
It's related to Santa Maria. Make sure to find him.

324
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,100
Yes, I got it.

325
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,280
Hi, AG-3.

326
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,290
What brings you here, Master?

327
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,700
From now on, I will pick you up every day.

328
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,050
We have to lower your battery usage as much as possible.

329
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:16,200
So don't move around thoughtlessly and don't run around either.

330
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,500
Got it?

331
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,970
Because I'm your precious treasure?

332
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,960
Forget it. Prepare for a scolding when we go inside.

333
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,360
A scolding without a reason is not fair, Master.

334
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,850
There is a reason. Friend mode.

335
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,280
Friend!

336
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,020
What's up with the pick up service all of a sudden?

337
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:59,250
You abandoned me again yesterday. Do you know how flustered I was when I woke up in the morning?

338
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,690
If that's so easy for you, then keep doing it! I'll just sell you off to a junkyard.

339
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:10,350
And from now on, whenever I'm meeting someone, stay where I can see you.

340
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,880
Why?

341
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,710
If you don't, it's a violation of the contract.

342
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,810
Shut up and input it. Absolutely and definitely,

343
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,220
stay around where your master can see you. Understand?

344
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,850
Okay.

345
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,620
Also, clean here.

346
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,160
You said not to do physical labor to save battery life.

347
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,570
Just clean.

348
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,760
So moody!

349
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,000
   

350
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,070
   

351
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,410
You don't look good in pink.

352
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,630
I'm not giving it to you because you deserve it.

353
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,890
You have to go to places with me from now on.

354
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,980
So your fashion style should be neat and clean.

355
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,700
If not, then I'd be embarrassed so how would I be able to take you anywhere?

356
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,490
Wear anything you like and come outside.

357
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,420
She's still making these.

358
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:51,650

359
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,820
♫  It seems like I will have time that I didn't have before  ♫

360
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,860
Is it weird?

361
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,890
It's pretty.

362
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,760
Really?

363
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,740
Really pretty.

364
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,050
Oh, wait a second. I can't be like this.

365
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,500
Why not?

366
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,220
I promised Doctor Hong.

367
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,930
 Promise me that you won't even lay a tip of your finger on AG-3. 

368
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:31,590
 My body is mine, so why is he telling him to not touch me? 

369
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,620
♫  I want to know how you feel  ♫

370
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,270
AG-3,

371
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,150
I have something to tell you.

372
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,200
♫  For the moment I meet you  ♫
