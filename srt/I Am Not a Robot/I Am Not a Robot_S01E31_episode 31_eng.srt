1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,900
Chairman Park Sung Jin wasn't murdered by President Hwang Do Won, but Martin.

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,520
A video of him confessing his crime was recorded on AG-3.

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,690
I heard there is an emergency board meeting tomorrow. In my opinion, we should all go together—

4
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,330
No. That won't solve anything.

5
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,640
Then? Do you have another plan?

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,100
I'm going to make it so that my illness can't be a weapon for them any longer.

7
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,220
Are you going to head in?

8
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,100
Have some.

9
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,930
When you were young, whenever I brought this bread over,

10
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,700
you and Young Master Kim Min Kyu would enjoy it a lot.

11
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,910
Do you also know about it?

12
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,060
About Min Kyu. About his illness.

13
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,770
How could I not know about it? I was by his side for fifteen years.

14
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,570
Fifteen years?

15
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,300
Yes.

16
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,760
It started when both of his parents died.

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,910
I think around that time, it seems that he was deeply hurt by people.

18
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,710
 Sign here. 

19
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,350
 My dad told me that once you sign this, you and I will be able to live together. 

20
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,300
 Cheer up, friend. 

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,750
 No, we're now family. 

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,610
 What is this? What is this?! Get away. Go away!! 

23
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,690
 What is this?! 

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,110
   

25
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,050
   

26
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,810
After that day, he locked himself up in this house for fifteen years.

27
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,150
He couldn't come into contact with people.

28
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,050
He had to personally make his own food.

29
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,650
Even when he was in pain, he endured through it.

30
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,950
Most of all, there was not one person who came to visit him.

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,240
Why didn't you come visit him back then?

32
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,680
Because I felt bad.

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,870
If you were sorry, you have to say it for that person to know.

34
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,980
I heard it was my fault.

35
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,030
The reason why he got his illness.

36
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,240
I was the only one who felt like it was unfair.

37
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,260
I kept asking, "Why is he treating me like this?"

38
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,660
I was certain that we were once friends, but how...

39
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,490
How could he do that to me?

40
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,600
I was always pretending to be the victim.

41
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:59,570
Therefore, I started to slowly justify the actions made by my father and me.

42
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,460
You were young at that time, too.

43
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,520
You also didn't know that Min Kyu had an illness like that.

44
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,210
Min Kyu will understand all of it.

45
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,980
It's not too late. You two can go back to how you guys were.

46
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,030
Can we really go back?

47
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,820
I'm sure that he is having trouble sleeping because of the news conference tomorrow.

48
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,830
♫  Don't frown, everyone is-  ♫

49
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,560
Yeah? What is it?

50
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,760
What? Where are you?

51
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,460
When did you get here?

52
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,430
A while back.

53
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,630
Are you all right?

54
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,210
Friend mode.

55
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,600
Hey. Why is your face all wrinkled up? You want me to iron it for you?

56
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Just who is it? Who is the person that dares to do something to you? Tell them to come here and I'll take care of them all!

57
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,810
Aigoo, you're so cute.

58
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,770
You can't go somewhere else and act this cute.

59
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,360
You are the only person who finds me cute.

60
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,400
What? Why? What's wrong about you?

61
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,840
I know, right? What's wrong about me?

62
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,510
You are the cutest and prettiest girl out of all the girls I know.

63
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,340
You don't know that many girls, though.

64
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,760
Should I go and meet more girls?

65
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,160
I will kill you.

66
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,260
If I'm that cute, are you going to raise my rank back to "Lovely?"

67
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,920
- No.
 - Why not?

68
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,330
There is this rank above "Lovely" and that's where you stand.

69
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,600
What is it?

70
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,860
"Onion." A special rank made for you because no matter how much I find out about you, there's always more.

71
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,420
I told you everything. I told you all of it.

72
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,070
When? When? I'm sure there's more.

73
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,920
- I already told you everything at Mt. Hwangmae.
 - What? You want to go through it right now?

74
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,660
You are such a mean person.

75
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,710
- I'm sure there's more. There is! 
- I already told you that there's none left.

76
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,260
Hey...

77
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,580
Do you feel a little better now?

78
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,620
I think I will be able to win the fight tomorrow thanks to you.

79
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,050
Do you need me during that fight?

80
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,460
Should I stand at the back of the conference room?

81
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,150
No, it's fine. I'll go alone.

82
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,610
I know that wherever I go, you'll always be by my side.

83
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,580
Go, fight them well, and return, my friend.

84
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,110
I'll fight them well and come back, my friend.

85
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,410
We will now start the emergency board of directors meeting.

86
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,870
The agenda is very important for the future of KM Financial.

87
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,960
So the board of directors have to come to a decision, which is why—

88
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,300
Wait a moment.

89
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,880
I would like to say something before you reveal the agenda.

90
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,240
Chairman Kim Min Kyu is holding a press conference at this moment.

91
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,800
Because it might affect our decisions,

92
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,570
I think we should check what he will talk about first.

93
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,740
What nonsense are you saying? Let's just continue with the board meeting.

94
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,930
Who knows? Maybe he is actually revealing an important piece of information?

95
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,540
Isn't he just  trying to deceive us?

96
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,970
  
   

97
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,760
I am KM Financial's chairman, Kim Min Kyu.

98
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,480
And also,

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,580
I am a patient with a human allergy.

100
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,270
 As soon as I come into contact with a human, I start to have difficulty breathing 

101
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,060
and weird rashes start to appear on my body because of this allergy.

102
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,800
This is why I always carry gloves and a baton with me.

103
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,850
I'm sure there are many people who are wondering how  a person like me can

104
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,640
fulfill the duty of chairman of a company.

105
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,470
Whenever I go to work,

106
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,720
because of the employees that always keep their distance from me,

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
I have been able to attend meetings without a  problem.

108
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,700
As for my other duties,

109
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,620
I was able to resolve them because of a proficient team leader.

110
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,220
The only one thing I can tell you with confidence is

111
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,390
I am slowly becoming freed from

112
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,460
this so-called human allergy.

113
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,610
All of a sudden, one day,

114
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,990
a robot appeared in my life.

115
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,740
I was able to become friends with that robot.

116
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,810
I also tried my best to connect with it.

117
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,260
Yes.

118
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,200
That was how it happened.

119
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,300
 Honestly, that robot 

120
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,970
 was at times a human and at other times, a robot. 

121
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,030
 My feelings were 

122
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,630
 input into the robot 

123
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,700
 and the human. 

124
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:29,090
 And like this, a miracle occurred. 

125
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,940
That fact has brought me the biggest transition of my mentality. 
   

126
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,930
 And this is for the reporters who came here today. 

127
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,870
 Another exclusive story for you to tell. 

128
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,100
From now on, KM Financial, a company that specialized in M&amp;A's,

129
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,580
will become a company that invests in future industries and bases its ideologies on human emotions.

130
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,260
 That is the plan for change. 

131
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,440
 For the first time in fifteen years, KM Financial 

132
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,510
 is seeking a new change. 

133
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,630
 Do you happen to have a specific blueprint laid out right now? 

134
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,700
First of all, KM Financial will

135
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,810
fully invest in the development of an artificially intelligent robot

136
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,710
that is able to connect and share emotions with human beings.

137
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,960
With Doctor Hong Baek Gyun who is the world's finest robotics engineer,

138
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,100
in order for us to lead the 4th industrial revolution,

139
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,300
we are planning to support as much as we can without holding back.

140
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,750
Is Doctor Hong currently in Seoul right now?

141
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,780
- Is it possible to have an interview with him? 
- Is it possible for you to be completely cured of a human allergy?

142
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,630
Doctor, it looks like you'll have to deal with some annoyance for a while.

143
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,460
So, we will be the ones leading the 4th industrial revolution.

144
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,240
Oh man, why do my shoulders feel so heavy?

145
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,460
It really does feel heavy, so please stop.

146
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,250
I would like to talk to you for a minute, Doctor.

147
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,750
- The stocks are soaring. 
 - What?! The stocks are?! 
- What's going on here?!

148
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,270
Everyone, please stay focused!

149
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,260
We don't have much time so let's immediately decide on the dismissal of Chairman Kim Min Kyu.

150
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,930
After watching the press conference, the thought that Chairman Kim will still

151
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,240
be a  necessary leader that we can't do without in our KM Financial

152
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,510
came into my mind more strongly.

153
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,230
So I will support this new road map that Chairman Kim has created.

154
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,580
I enthusiastically agree with it and as a stockholder,

155
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,490
and also as an agent of President Hwang Do Won,

156
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,260
I oppose the proposal to dismiss Chairman Kim.

157
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,120
What is this all about?!

158
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,480
I also support Chairman Kim as well.

159
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,590
So I also oppose this proposal to dismiss Chairman Kim.

160
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,720
- Hey, did you see it all?
 - Yup.

161
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,670
Kim Min Kyu, you were super duper incredibly awesome today!

162
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,170
This is the boyfriend you have.

163
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,740
I have to go in to work so go spend time somewhere for a bit. I'll come that way as soon as I'm done.

164
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,590
Thank you.

165
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,480
Okay, good luck with wrapping things up.

166
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,330
You better really do a good job, okay?

167
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,130
You know I invested a lot in you, right?

168
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:57,560
Thank you but  will you be okay?

169
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,780
I trust in your capabilities, so I'm looking forward to it.

170
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,200
The future that you proposed for KM.

171
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,230
I will have a lot to do, too,  in that future. Right?

172
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:13,140
And to be honest, more than me, Yoo Cheol was the one who worked hard to persuade the other Board of Directors' members.

173
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,570
Alrighty then, I guess I should  leave at this moment

174
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,980
so that you two can resolve the fifteen year long tension. Right?

175
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,170
I knew it all.

176
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,990
The meaning of the document that I gave to you

177
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,530
and how my father was trying to scheme you.

178
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,180
I found out after looking for the document in my father's study later on.

179
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:56,190
But I still couldn't bear to tell you that I knew about it.

180
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,800
So for all those years I had no idea about it.

181
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,220
So that's why I technically didn't do anything wrong to you.

182
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,790
Thinking that my father didn't do it with the wrong heart.

183
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,590
I guess I wanted to protect myself by justifying it in my own way.

184
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,350
I was a coward and a fool.

185
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,410
Kim Min Kyu, I'm sorry that it took me so long to come around.

186
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,090
Min Kyu, I'm sorry.

187
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,400
There is evidence that Chairman Martin killed Chairman Park Sung Jin,

188
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,390
and Interpol decided to get involved with this.

189
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,240
Go and persuade your father.

190
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,740
He needs to confess first for his sentence to be reduced.

191
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,670
All right. Thanks for letting me know.

192
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:54,100
I don't know why but I feel like it will be okay to right now.

193
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,250
Where are you?

194
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,810
Should we meet on the street we walked on when it was snowing that one time?

195
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,650
Should we? Okay, I will be there right away.

196
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:44,490
T-Team Leader Jo... How long were you there for?

197
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,590
Since a little bit ago. I knocked on the door before I came in.

198
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,840
Have a seat please.

199
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,510
- Thank you for all your work today. 
- Yes.

200
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,390
With that, it looks like everything has been taken care of.

201
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,710
What do you think, Chairman?

202
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,190
I also think the same. You should leave early on a day like today.

203
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,300
Then please process my resignation letter with today's date.

204
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,260
Pardon?

205
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,480
But, Team Leader Jo, I already...

206
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,830
That was your opinion, Chairman.

207
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:41,040
My volition regarding the resignation letter has still not changed.

208
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,360
- But still...
 - I remained by you because there was still a lot to do.

209
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,780
And now that it's all over, the next course of action

210
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,510
is that I should leave. It's only right.

211
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,720
Team Leader Jo.

212
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,750
Please.

213
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,020
Well then, goodbye.

214
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,750
Why do you want to go buy clothes all of a sudden?

215
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,380
Because I think you're going to get tons of requests for interviews very soon.

216
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,510
I can just wear what I have.

217
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,080
Don't you think that Kim Min Kyu has unexpected charm and appeal?

218
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,770
Whenever I saw him at the house, he just felt like a little brother to me.

219
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,610
But seeing him at work, he has this oozing charisma.

220
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,100
I guess he's not a chairman for nothing.

221
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,430
He is also very competitive.

222
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,870
What about me?

223
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,320
There is nothing unexpected about you since you are too familiar to me.

224
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,910
Why?

225
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,970
Should we date each other?

226
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,780
Wh-Wh-What?

227
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,980
How long are you going to stare at me like that?

228
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,050
Until you look at me.

229
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,890
Here. I'm looking at you. Satisfied?

230
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,260
Should we date each other?

231
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,180
Why are you laughing?

232
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,280
Let's go.

233
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,520
Doctor, you're not going to answer?

234
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,440
It's cold. Let's get going.

235
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm sorry that I can't live like the daughter that you want me to be, Dad.

236
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,410
But I will be happy in exchange for all that since what you really want deep inside

237
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,570
is my happiness after all.

238
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,050
I have faith in that.

239
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,850
It looked like you were shaking but you still did a good job.

240
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,440
I was really nervous at first.

241
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,340
But I let out a big breath and then I was able to see you.

242
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,280
Afterwards I lost all nervousness and words just spilled out very easily.

243
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,620
I came out of my body at that time and went over to you for a second.

244
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,080
Oh, and...

245
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,400
I was able to carry on a proper conversation with Yoo Cheol for the first time in fifteen years.

246
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,130
And I was the first one to offer him a handshake.

247
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,010
I don't know why but I suddenly had this feeling that it would be okay.

248
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,560
- You shook his hand? 
- Yes.

249
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,980
Was it okay?

250
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,540
Yup! And I think it was okay after I saw you.

251
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,250
So you should take care of your treasure well.

252
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,430
It's so cold.

253
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,390
You said it's cold, so why are you giving it to me?

254
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,110
To take care of my treasure well.

255
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,500
What do you want to do today? I will do everything that you ask.

256
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,760
No, wait. Is this really what you wanted to eat?

257
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,140
Seriously.

258
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:12,170
By the way... Team Leader Jo, what's his personality like?

259
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,210
If it's a no once, then it's a no forever.

260
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,300
I see. To you, who is he?

261
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,730
Like a father.

262
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,810
Team Leader Jo... quit today.

263
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,550
- Really?
 - Yeah.

264
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:40,720
But Team Leader Jo... I don't have any idea on how to convince him.

265
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,170
- Team Leader Jo...
 - Quit?

266
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,660
- Ji Ah's brother? 
- He turned in his resignation?

267
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,950
Did you do something wrong?

268
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,760
Before... a bit.

269
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,120
No. Honestly, a lot. But well... not recently.

270
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,470
He doesn't seem like someone who would hold grudges though.

271
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,630
Didn't you see him proceeding with the lawsuit against his own sister?

272
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,370
What do you mean doesn't hold a grudge? He doesn't even know of such a thing.

273
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,590
He's uncomfortable then.

274
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,510
What?

275
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,390
Having his younger sister's boyfriend as his superior.

276
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,280
So uncomfortable. Thinking about it, it's super uncomfortable.

277
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,460
Was that so uncomfortable?

278
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,610
For me, I thought we agreed well.

279
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,470
Work is work and personal matters are another thing.

280
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,930
It feels like the second season of "Making Kim Min Kyu Into a Human Being" started just now.

281
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,550
Seems like it, right?

282
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,750
I know. It's this. I'm sure.

283
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,650
What is?

284
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,110
Brother, he doesn't like you as Ji Ah's boyfriend.

285
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:53,800
- Hey! Just because you have a mouth. 
- Your mouth, your mouth!

286
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,720
Seriously! You guys are of absolutely no help.

287
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,070
Why did you follow me here? I came in to rest by myself.

288
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,020
Why?

289
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,030
These days, where do people go on dates?

290
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,260
Why are you asking about that?

291
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,520
Why? Am I not supposed to ask about those things?

292
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,950
You don't even have someone to go on a date with.

293
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,520
Why? Did you get one?

294
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,240
That's not it. There isn't any woman around.

295
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,360
Be quiet!

296
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,800
I told you to keep quiet!

297
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,460
Wow. Since when?

298
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,510
But then... you really match well.

299
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,460
- Of course.
 - I went somewhere really fun today.

300
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,110
- Should I tell you?
 - Where is it?

301
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,020
Dad's soup.

302
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,140
- Thank you.
 - Yes.

303
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,160
Brother, did you really quit your job?

304
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,490
It's not because of you, so don't mind it.

305
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,630
What? You quit?

306
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,740
Hong Joo.

307
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,950
I was patient, but you're being too much.

308
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,070
Before when you told me everything you hid from me,  I told you never to do that ever again. Right?

309
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,150
But what? You quit without even telling me?

310
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,300
No... I already submitted my resignation ahead of time.

311
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,130
What! You submitted it ahead of time?

312
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,290
I'm seriously getting mad.

313
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,180
- Hong Joo, calm down.
 - Hong Joo.

314
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,160
Do I seem like I can be calm right now?

315
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,140
Mom, the baby will be startled.

316
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,220
I'm sorry, baby.

317
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,770
There's a limit to being inflexible!

318
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,890
Go and get back your resignation right now. Aren't you going to answer?

319
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,830
Okay.

320
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,700
You fool. It's still not too late. At least—

321
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,180
No. It's all finished.

322
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,000
A confession that Martin killed Chairman Park Sung Jin has surfaced as evidence.

323
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Before Martin gets caught, you should confess to everything that you know.

324
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That way your sentence will be reduced.

325
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,670
Impossible. This Hwang Do Won is not yet done.

326
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:40,060
You should accept the reality now, Father. Please.

327
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,520
So you will pay part of the rent to get a corner of this cafe?

328
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,730
Yeah. What's that? A shop...

329
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,070
Shop-in-shop?

330
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,110
Yeah. In a corner of the cafe,

331
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,750
I will use it as an office and showroom.

332
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,490
Sounds good. I'm down.

333
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,280
But what about your development fee? Last time, Hong Joo...

334
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,730
Hong Joo is in rage mode now. We shouldn't bother her.

335
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,790
Why? Did something happen?

336
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,920
Brother quit his job.

337
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,410
Reasonable to get mad.

338
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,420
Then ask Kim Min Kyu to invest.

339
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,420
I will do it on my own. That... crowd funding? I will do it through that.

340
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,690
Crowd funding?

341
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,160
It's when I put my idea on the Internet

342
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,820
and get some investments. There's something like that.

343
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,700
Then instead of paying a part of the rent, let's agree on giving me a percentage of your earnings.

344
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,280
Let's go, Jo Ji Ah!

345
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,060
If so, then I...

346
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,900
will be going since I have a date with Dong Won.

347
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,370
I will be closing the cafe.

348
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,400
Okay.

349
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,640
Are you feeling well?

350
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,960
Yes. Ah... I'm all better. I'm the same as other people.

351
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,260
I can touch you like this.

352
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,130
I'm sorry.

353
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,290
- I...
 - I...

354
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,230
Go ahead.

355
00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:00,390
That... about your resignation...

356
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,220
Yes, about that...

357
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:13,260
I think... I... that...

358
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,300
The resignation...

359
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,110
Yes, I will just take care of it like you asked.

360
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,590
If you really feel that way.

361
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,190
I... would like it if we worked together,

362
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,490
but it seems like you are uncomfortable because of Ji Ah.

363
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:40,390
But still, if you change your mind tell me anytime.

364
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,070
I will welcome you wholeheartedly.

365
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,750
♫  Don't frown  ♫

366
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,130
♫  Everyone is-  ♫

367
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,770
Yeah. Why?

368
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,670
Where are you?

369
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,810
I'm at Summer Snow.

370
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,060
Should I go there?

371
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,160
I'm working though.

372
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,060
Is work important or am I important?

373
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,660
Work is important and so are you.

374
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,040
I want to see you right now though.
