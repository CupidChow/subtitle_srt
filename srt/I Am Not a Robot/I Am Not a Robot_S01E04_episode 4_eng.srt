1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,620
What?! The part for it went to Africa?!

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,990
It only takes a day to come from Japan so why would it go all the way to Africa?!

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,440
They said... that they put the wrong shipping label on it.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,180
Coming from Africa

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,080
- will take at least five days. 
- I'm going to go crazy.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,030
Wow.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,220
Oh crap. 
   

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,550
- Yes, Chairman. 
  - The performance of the robot is beyond my expectation. 

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,190
It's quite amazing. I will applaud you for that.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,280
So I made up my mind to put off the decision making for another month.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,940
I was thinking about training the robot. You said it takes a month, right?

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,860
Please send AG-3 over to the house for a month, starting tomorrow.

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,150
That... will be impossible.

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,340
Is there a problem?

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,140
That is... moving... Yes, that's right.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,690
The contract for renting this building is over so we have go around to find a place to move into.

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,350
I think it will be possible after a week or so...

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,600
Then you can leave AG-3 at my house tomorrow.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,840
No can do. The robot has to be charged every day until noon.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,430
Charging up the robot is only possible here at the laboratory due to the high voltage needed.

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,410
I will send someone over to bring AG-3 to me every day then.

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,510
You can't do that! Others may handle it wrong

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,890
and break it.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,380
Am I not the rightful owner of AG-3 right now?

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,600
Before the contract, we share halves.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,530
I will send her over after a week.

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,620
- I'll give you a call at another time. 
- Okay.

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,250
 Timing and Subtitles by The Robotic Team @ viki.com  

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,580
   

30
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,410
   

31
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,340
Team Leader Jo, you should also watch out as well.

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,100
Do you know what our company employees say about those who follow Baton?

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,700
That they're on a Jordan River Express destined for Hell.

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Baton is the early chairman's son. The CEO is the current president's son.

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,860
This is a competition between two second-generations.

36
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,280
Even if Baton is quite capable, it's very obvious that the son of the current president will win, don't you think?

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,250
So, please, before crossing the Jordan River,

38
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,750
go on an exodus. Hurry up and run away.

39
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,320
Jordan River...

40
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,580
Get in the car, please.

41
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,560
The backseat.

42
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,810
I'm getting in.

43
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,240
Sorry.

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,470
Social contribution team leader's resignation letter has been taken care of.

45
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,210
I'm pretty sure you have stopped all the projects that team has been working on, right?

46
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,860
- Sponsoring young entrepreneurs has only final evaluation—
- Halt it.

47
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,930
Okay... And for that necklace robbery case, we're checking the CCTV—

48
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,400
I don't care about that anymore. Have a look at the document next to you first.

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,880
Okay.

50
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,750
Chairman Park Seong Jin from Daeyang Shipbuilding was very interested in robotics for the future of the company, but the board of directors was against it.

51
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,280
How come nobody knew about this?

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,110
So Chairman Park secretly teamed up with Dr. Hong Baek Gyun.

53
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,520
By creating the Santa Maria team, making it look like it was a R&amp;D team for shipbuilding purposes?

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,870
All internal reports were sent directly to the chairman.

55
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,370
So after the chairman died, the existence of this research team was buried in secret.

56
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,330
That's why it wasn't found in the due diligence phase.

57
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,970
A team that was granted 100 billion in research funding.

58
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,880
I think the other R&amp;D teams will need additional investigations as well.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,220
Should I report it to the CEO?

60
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,520
We're the only ones who know about this.

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,420
The thing I'm curious about is

62
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,350
who knows about this and how much exactly.

63
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,220
You'll have to investigate that, Team Leader Jo.

64
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,670
Especially those around CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol and

65
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,020
President Hwang Do Won.

66
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,940
 Jordan River Express destined for Hell, Jordan River Express. 

67
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,100
That's a job for the audit team.

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,890
Do you need me to transfer you as the team leader of the audit team?

69
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,010
No. I will do my best with the investigation.

70
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,990
That's great. But there is something you need to do before you conduct another due diligence.

71
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,820
So you're telling us to come into the main house?

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,310
If I were to give you one bit of advice,

73
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,440
if the chairman suggests something, just consider it your destiny

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,370
and accept it.

75
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,850
That'll make you feel the most comfortable.

76
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,760
What if I refuse?

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,240
Whether or not to invest more in the Santa Maria team or sell it off to another company,

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,980
the chairman will decide after seeing the test results.

79
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,900
If Santa Maria gets sold to another company then there is probably

80
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,850
a high chance that the team will be disbanded.

81
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,410
   
  

82
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,370
It's has been fifteen years already.

83
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,330
Father, if you were alive right now, we would have celebrated your 60th birthday.

84
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,470
Mother, I am still

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,580
alive and well.

86
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,460
I came by since it would have been your father's 60th birthday.

87
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,580
I get to see your face here.

88
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,380
Yoo Cheol is having a hard time.

89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,920
He's lacking a lot compared to you, right? I know that, too.

90
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,640
But still, Yoo Cheol is your long-time friend.

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,780
He's trying to do something as the CEO.

92
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,010
Can't you become his strength as his friend?

93
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,170
I don't have the strength to do that,

94
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,640
President Hwang Do Won.

95
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,180
Then, I have some work so I'll get going.

96
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,190
Honey, are you there?

97
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,930
I'm right here.

98
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,040
Wow, this is really interesting now that I see it in real life.

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,470
It's really cool.

100
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Yes, hello?

101
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
Yes, I'm Jo Ji Ah.

102
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,160
Wh-What did you say? The final judging has been postponed indefinitely?

103
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,710
That's like saying it will never happen then.

104
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,450
Who made such a preposterous decision?

105
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,780
The chairman of the board of directors apparently.

106
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,440
KM Financial's head honcho.

107
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,860
I'm seriously speechless.

108
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,740
It was going too well. I knew it.

109
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,430
Am I living a life where things are not allowed to go well?

110
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,780
Let things work out please! Smoothly.

111
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,930
Give up. What power do lower level employees have against the decision of the head honcho?

112
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,190
Hey, then we just have to make the guy in charge reverse his decision.

113
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,920
Did you go day drinking? How will you accomplish that?

114
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,710
- A petition written with flattery and brown-nosing. 
 - What?!

115
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,390
We can take a petition and ask him to back it again.

116
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:00,420
As soon as you give him that, you'll get dragged out by your neck.

117
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,990
Instead of going to the company, send it directly to the head honcho's house.

118
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,290
You know that guy's house address, right?

119
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,580
Oh, right. You don't.

120
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,860
Wait a second. Among my ex-boyfriends,

121
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,610
there was a 99-man (creep).

122
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,940
I didn't know your ex would be so useful!

123
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,040
Date more in the future!

124
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,380
Turn right after 100 meters.

125
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,140
Okay! Turn right!

126
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,360
Is this the right place?

127
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,930
It's the right place all right.

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,480
Hey, I can't see the house.

129
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,100
What else can it be then?

130
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,310
So this is a house? Not a hotel?

131
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,870
There is no hotel here.

132
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,610
This is Chairman Kim Min Kyu's home.

133
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,630
The house is so big that even if we put this in the mailbox,

134
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,510
I wonder if this will get to that guy's hands safe and sound?

135
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,220
Then you're going to send it to the company?

136
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,450
- Look for the doorbell. 
- You're going to go inside?

137
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,730
I came all the way over here so I should at least do something.

138
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,360
Who knows? This person might be touched by our utmost sincerity.

139
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,610
Gosh, so just where is that doorbell?

140
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,280
This place is really huge.

141
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,000
What's going on...

142
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,520
What is that jerk doing here?

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,340
Wait... That psychotic jerk is the head honcho of KM Financial?

144
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,990
I mean, in all my living,

145
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,850
how can things get this shitty and terribly twisted?

146
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,830
I get lashed, I get accused of being a thief, and I'm the victim of a perverted act.

147
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,680
But to top it off, that super psycho dine-and-dasher is the head honcho?

148
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,320
Sun Hye, I saved him from a near-death accident. Should I tell him to repay that favor?

149
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,780
That wasn't you, dearie, but the robot.

150
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,540
Now I know how the Little Mermaid felt.

151
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,910
I saved him! It was me who saved him! I can relate to how she felt, unable to say those words.

152
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,910
Seriously. And you wrote a petition, too.

153
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,600
That human being isn't someone who would accept a petition, that psycho jerk.

154
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,440
 Jo Ji Ah, get out quickly. 

155
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,020
What is it?!

156
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,190
I already paid back the money. What is it?

157
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,310
Where did you get that money?

158
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,540
Well, I got it from somewhere.

159
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,250
Where in the world did you get ten million won overnight?

160
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,880
I did part-time work. Honest work.

161
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,250
Please let's talk later. I'm tired.

162
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,370
Please say something that makes sense. Tell me the truth.

163
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,050
Did you go to a loan shark or did you sign an organ selling contract?

164
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,410
Say something so I can fix this up quickly.

165
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,260
I know you're smart since you're a lawyer.

166
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,360
But there are lots and lots of things in this world that are really peculiar and can't be put into words.

167
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,940
Oppa, the world you live in is not the only world that exists.

168
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,640
Ah, why? Why are you going into my room?

169
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,080
What are you doing? Why are you going through a girl's room and all?

170
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,650
I told you to stop, didn't I?

171
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,600
Brother. Brother, let's go out and talk.

172
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,110
I told you to prepare to apply for jobs, didn't I? I told you to build your resume, didn't I?

173
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,540
Is this it? Did you spend 10 million won on making this trash?

174
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,100
Oppa, don't touch these kids.

175
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,080
Hit me instead. Beat me.

176
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,610
Where did you get the money? Tell me honestly.

177
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,580
Seriously! I told you I took a part-time job.

178
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,950
So you won't tell me the truth?

179
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,400
Get out. If you're not going to tell me where you got the money, then take that trash and get out at once.

180
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,280
My heart lamp.

181
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,340
What should I do? It's broken.

182
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,640
You're really too much.

183
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,860
Did I ever go to a loan shark? Did I ever do something weird?

184
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,100
I never did! I told you, I didn't!

185
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,280
But you've never done something trustworthy either, you brat!

186
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,540
You don't know what kind of mindset I had when I made this.

187
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,240
This is my last hope, so why won't you acknowledge that?

188
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,870
What I want to do. What I wish for!

189
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,530
Why won't you acknowledge them? Give me a break!

190
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,510
You give me a break instead!

191
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,590
I don't think I can stand seeing you anymore because I'm so pissed off.

192
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,990
So if you want to live as you please, don't show up before me.

193
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,990
Okay, I got it.

194
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,460
I will go out. I can't live with you anymore either.

195
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,260
Ji Ah. You're actually leaving after that?

196
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,140
Your brother was just saying that and you know it. Let's go in.

197
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,900
Don't worry about me. I'll go to Sun Hye's place.

198
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,710
It's best that Brother and I don't see each other for now, or else one of us will die from having our blood run dry.

199
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,070
♫  Don't wrinkle up your face  ♫

200
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,800
Yes, CEO.

201
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,970
The building owner said to vacate the warehouse by tonight.

202
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,510
I was going to tell you earlier but totally forgot.

203
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,170
It's all right. I'm so grateful you let me store my stuff with you all this time.

204
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,170
Well, gosh.

205
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,100
There's nothing more upsetting than old merchandise that won't sell, right?

206
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,780
CEO Jo, don't upset yourself anymore and hand these to the cheap consignment.

207
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,600
CEO, you have a hand cart. Right?

208
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,430
Hello, come take a look. Take just one look before you go.

209
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,970
It's 30,000 won. Every product is for sale at 30,000 won.

210
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:57,340
A cleaning outfit that you can wear to clean your house while rolling around is only 30,000 won.

211
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,620
This gorilla bag that has a cup holder is only 30,000 won. Come have a look.

212
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,220
Hello, this is only 10,000 won.

213
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,690
Hello, please have a look. They're all only 10,000 won each.

214
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,300
Mother, it's only 10,000 won. Just use it once.

215
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,950
Forget it. If I take this stuff, it just becomes trash.

216
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,230
Is it fun?

217
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:34,430

218
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,110
 My Princess, what are you doing? 

219
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:59,270
 My desk partner transferred from another school, but she came with a broken foot yesterday.   

220
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,060
 I think it's really hard for her to walk. 

221
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,700
 If I put wheels on the shoes for her, it might be easier. 

222
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,370
 You noticed that?  

223
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,080
 Yeah, all I could see was her foot all day.  

224
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,000
 Dad sees cars well but our Ji Ah sees people well.  

225
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,890
 I see people well? What's good if I see them well?  

226
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,040
 Wow, amazing. It really works.  

227
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,720
 Ji Ah, did you really make that?  

228
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,090
 Yup. Dad and I made it after drawing a picture.  

229
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,740
 You did such a good job. 

230
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,010
 Ji Ah, thank you. This is so comfortable. 

231
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,980
 We're friends anyway. 

232
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,410
 Just like how Dad fixes cars well, 

233
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,830
 our Ji Ah will surely become someone who is definitely needed by others, right?  

234
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,030
 You surely will.  

235
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,220
 I believe in you.

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,160
 We are all on your side, Jo Ji Ah. Rest your worry and...  

262
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,040
 could you be our robot for just a few more days?  

263
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,040
 You're going to go into that house again on your own? 

264
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,670
I really want to put this heart lamp out into the world.

265
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,770
I thought about it a hundred times, a thousand times, and this is really an item that people need.

266
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,700
So no matter what it takes, I'll get them to re-open the final screening.

267
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,130
How?

268
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,640
I have to let it be known

269
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,990
just how rewarding it is to fund young entrepreneurs with dreams and hopes in this era.

270
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,000
So I am going to make that super dine-and-dash jerk open the screening again himself, no matter what.

271
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,640
No use sending texts either.

272
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,600
If you were just a bit more cautious in how you treated Jo Ji Ah, Doctor—

273
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,780
- I know.
 - Why did you have to say that to her?

274
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,240
Let's just move in and endure it. He won't actually chase us out, will he?

275
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,930
This isn't time for us to be like this right now.

276
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:29,070
We need to go to Jo Ji Ah and beg if we need to.

277
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,580
I will work more for you.

278
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,890
For free.

279
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,750
How about one week?

280
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,460
What is your reason?

281
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,150
Why is he asking that?

282
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,340
The reason...

283
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:00,870
I thought about it and I think I got paid too much from you so I feel uneasy.

284
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,710
Still... I guess you were concerned about me.

285
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,840
- But I have a condition. 
 - Condition?

286
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,290
- Provide room and board. 
- Room and board...

287
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,300
Oh, we...

288
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,920
are moving.

289
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,750
Santa Maria team has disappeared, President.

290
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,350
Besides you,

291
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,420
is there anyone else that knows that Santa Maria

292
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,710
is a robot development team?

293
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,640
If not, how could they cancel the meeting

294
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,500
the night before the contract is supposed to be signed?

295
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,480
Even my son doesn't have a clue about Santa Maria.

296
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,870
I'm the only one who knows about this.

297
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,020
I've already done my part.

298
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,340
Now it's time for you to meet your end of the deal.

299
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,120
When will the AG-3 be in my hands?

300
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,130
I will make sure that happens

301
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,060
in the very near future.

302
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,400
It's super grand.

303
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,740
It's amazing! Look at the front yard. We can have BBQ now.

304
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,940
There must be a lot of vegetables here, too, probably.

305
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,330
Now we can finally live like human beings.

306
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,560
So you've been living as an animal until now?

307
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,800
You can't park your car here though.

308
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,360
We moved in today. Here!

309
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,540
Not here, but over there.

310
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,740
Not there.

311
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Let's go there by car.

312
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,410
Yes.

313
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,110
Let's go.

314
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,780
Welcome to my home.

315
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,640
As the butler who is taking care of and managing this very big home all alone,

316
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,000
I will tell you the rules you all must follow.

317
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,760
First, do not roam around as you please.

318
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,710
Just because this place is wide, it doesn't mean you can roam around to your liking.

319
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,850
From this guest house to no more than a 20-meter radius.

320
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,610
That's the maximum ground you can step on. You cannot step past that.

321
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,870
The front gate entrance and exit are to be done by car only.

322
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,860
For everyday purposes, use the back door next to this detached house.

323
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,490
So in other words, within my young master's sight,

324
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,780
do not be seen is what I mean.

325
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,590
What's this?

326
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,170
Can we order delivery? Food delivery.

327
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,530
Absolutely not.

328
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:24,050
Groceries will be provided to you in ample amount so you can cook and eat to your delight.

329
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,630
That was the fourth point here. Okay.

330
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,160
Then let's all get along well while you're here.

331
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,820
Be well aware of these rules.

332
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,020
Open it up for her. Open.

333
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,660
We're not boarding as servants in some Joseon era nobleman's house. What is this?

334
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,670
We're not beggars though, Doctor.

335
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,970
I thought I would die from lack of air in there.

336
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,080
We're staying here?

337
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,880
He lives in some grand palace and he pushes all of us in some warehouse?

338
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,860
How meager of him.

339
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,240
Can we see him from here?

340
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,150
Don't do it. Don't open. He'll see you.

341
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,860
He can't. It's blocked by the trees.

342
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,140
Pi, check if there are CCTVs outside the building, and if there are, remove them.

343
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,760
Hoktal and Ssanip, let's first unpack.

344
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,130
- Yes.
 - Yes.

345
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,510
Hold on!

346
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,350
- Let's eat.
 - What?

347
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,800
My condition. Only one. Provide room and board.

348
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,670
Beetle. Beetle. Beetle.

349
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,700
Is that a robot, too?

350
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,700
You might not be able to tell but that's an AI robot actually.

351
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,100
Its name is Beetle.

352
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,230
He goes around everywhere to transmit Wi-Fi and pass along items.

353
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,980
How should I describe it? It's the cutest and youngest of our research team.

354
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,620
Sunbae Hoktal and Pi's joint work.

355
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,750
Pi is your sunbae? You must have gone to school really early.

356
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,600
She graduated super early.

357
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,370
Skipped a grade and another and another and graduated college at 17 years old.

358
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,900
She's a genius youth. I mean, genius young lady.

359
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,150
Is there anyone here who isn't a genius?

360
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,620
- Here. 
- Gosh.

361
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,370
Don't do that.

362
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,880
But you guys call each other nicknames. What do they mean?

363
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,940
Have you seen the Planet of the Apes? That's why he's Hoktal.
 (Hok-Seong-Tal-Chool is the Korean title for Planet of the Apes and 'tal' is a Korean word for mask.) 

364
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,640
That big mouth of yours.

365
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,070
Look at his mouth. It looks like a cheap mouth, right? That's why he's called Ssanip (cheap mouth).

366
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,780
I can totally tell Pi's. Apple pie? Walnut pie?

367
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,650
It's the circular constant. When she's stressed out she memorizes the circular constant.

368
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,410
Mold.

369
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,850
Doctor Hong Baek Gyun has a nickname too. Mold.

370
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,420
Hong-gyun (red bacteria) and Baek-gyun (white bacteria). When he's mad, he's red mold. Otherwise, white mold.

371
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,540
You really!

372
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,000
Funny?

373
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,110
This is a month past the expiration date.

374
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,070
We've eaten stuff that was two months past the date, too. It's fine.

375
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,490
As long as it is air-sealed properly, it's fine past 6 months.

376
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:09,540
It's delicious. Curry should be fermented.

377
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,940
Yes, Chairman?

378
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,310
Give me a short briefing on how to train AG-3.

379
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:26,060
Input. Enter data.

380
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,230
And a long briefing?

381
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,550
AG-3 being able to read human emotions.

382
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,460
It's through approximation from the numerous sample data in her database.

383
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,680
So there could be errors when she's facing individuals.

384
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,340
But if the registered counterpart is just one person,

385
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,110
then her approximation rate will increase greatly and she can have a complex emotional dialogue with you.

386
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,900
Register myself in AG-3?

387
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,210
When we are dealing with others as well. We go with the registered data we have of them. It's the same.

388
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,820
The more data we have, the higher degree of communication.

389
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:08,010
So Doctor, were you able to achieve the level of communication you wanted with AG-3?

390
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,850
She's become the AG-3 I wanted. It's better than a human.

391
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,110
AG-3 is better than a human. I agree on that.

392
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,110
Let's say I give AG-3 a deep learning of me.

393
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,580
Is that something the research center has privy to?

394
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:29,020
Install a password. Then you will have your own room like you are operating a computer.

395
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Inside AG-3, there will be my own room?

396
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,520
Hi, AG-3.

397
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,960
I love you, Master. What would you like?

398
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,890
I would like to set a password.

399
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,120
Please tell me your password.

400
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,530
San-d-wi-ch.

401
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,190
That word is set as a banned word.

402
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,420
Please tell me another password.

403
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,340
 Let's break up.  

404
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,870
 What crime did sandwich ever commit? The stuff you do.  

405
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:30,620
San-d-wi-ch is set as your password.

406
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,750
The ban on sandwich is released.

407
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,820
You saved me yesterday, right?

408
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,490
 Give me money if you're grateful. 

409
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,620
I liked the unexpected amusement, too.

410
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,060
 Give me money if it was amusing. 

411
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,430
I'll reward you for that.

412
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,710
 A reward already? 

413
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:04,720
Here, inside of you, I'm going to create a room for myself only.

414
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,420
Don't open up for anyone. It's only me who can go in,

415
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,070
since I'm going to train you.

416
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,470
Also...

417
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,950
In here. I'll put myself in here.

418
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,400
From now on, you will only look at me and watch over me.

419
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,120
And you must only follow me.

  This crazy jerk! 

430
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,480
 Hurry and get out.

 - Only you get to go?
 - Oh man.

 Don't touch me. Don't touch me, I said.

 Hurry. 

434

 Why are we like this at the same time? 

435
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,200
 I think it's that curry we ate yesterday.  

436
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,400
 The curry.  

437
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,860
 No. Ji Ah had two refills. 

438
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,050
 Why does my stomach hurt? 

439
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,230
 Go and tell her to hold it even if she dies. 

440
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,500
 Crap! 

441

 Whose idea was the tacky pink uniform? 

442

 You are asking because you really can't remember? 

443

 We are each other's dark history that we want to erase.

 How is it that this house is exactly the same as it was 15 years ago?

 Long time no see, Ye Ri El. No matter what image I turn into, I hope you will recognize me.

00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,880
