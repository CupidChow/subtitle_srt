1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,470
Open the door!
   

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,440
Don't be scared!

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,840
- We'll protect you, AG-3. 
- Open the door!

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,220
Don't open the door. Endure it!

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,430
Hands up! Put your hands up!

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,580
Take them!

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,240
Give me your hand!

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,890


9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,400
Are you all right, AG-3?

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,640
Let's go home quickly.

11
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,750
Search through everything thoroughly!

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,800
- Search the stairs, too. 
- Okay.

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,540
Search the stairwell and block the hallway.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,990
Just keep searching.

15
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:22,510
Do you think AG-3 will remember me, Uncle?

16
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,640
It will probably remember forever since it's a robot.

17
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,180
I'm hap-py.

18
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,370
We need to buy AG-3 a new pair of shoes.

19
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,330
I met a lot of people.

20
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,040
I want to read emotions from a lot more people.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,680
The world she saw for the first time must have been fun.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,400
Make a back-up of today's file, AG-3.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,480
A back-up has been made.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,630
AG-3, it's nice to be back home. Right?

25
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,610
I need to be charged.

26
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,710
That's right. Let's take a rest.

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,870
That's right. Let's get recharged, too.

28
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,710
I am completely drained. Burn out.

29
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,440
To be safe, let's give her a test to see if anything is wrong, Doctor.

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,240
AG-3, what's the safest seat on a train to Busan?

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,770
- Ma Dong Seok.
- Ma Dong Seok.
   

32
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,210
It's perfect. Perfect. I feel proud.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,570
What are you thinking about?

34
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,100
It's a secret.

35
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,050
Are you going to be like that?

36
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,950
It's because I'm happy.

37
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,910
About what?

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,590
Just about everything at this moment.

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:21,760
Because I did what I needed to do today. Also, because you're next to me right now.

40
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,600
Also!

41
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,840
Because I can lie down like this and look at you.

42
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,610
You're heavy.

43
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,900
Just endure it for a little bit.

44
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,690
By the way, you're really good at driving.

45
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,660
That's right. I told you that you should know that it's an honor.

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,920
Well, if you need me again, just tell me.

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,540
Do whatever what you want to do. Make what you want to make.

48
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,270
Instead, let me be the first person you show it to.

49
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,840
Since it's still a little dangerous for you to go around by yourself, I—

50
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,670
That's enough.

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,900
I should go.

52
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,440
Play with this.

53
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,280
- Where are you going to go? 
- I have to go home.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,200
- Then what about here? 
- This is your house.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,120
- Can't it just be your house? 
- What are you saying?

56
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,060
I'm hungry. Make me food.

57
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,190
You make it and eat it.

58
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,560
I have no strength!

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
Quickly make me food. Make me food...

60
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,520
Go and make your own food to eat.

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,690
Hurry up. Make me food.

62
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,890
- Okay. Okay. Get up. 
- Okay!

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,590
When I was younger, I went to a school picnic.

64
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,220
However, there was no one who could make kimbap for me, so I made my own.

65
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,130
 When my aunt was around my age, she went to a picnic. 

66
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,960
 But she didn't know how to make kimbap, so she made rice balls like this. 

67
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,650
 That was the first time she made them. 

68
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,960
 Why would a kid make kimbap? 

69
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,210
 She said that there was no one to make it for her. 

70
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,600
 She must've been teased a lot by others. Your aunt, I mean. 

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,090
 No one ate the rice balls with her. 

72
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,490
 However, my mom did. 

73
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,940
 That's why my aunt became my mom's guardian angel. 

74
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,420
♫  Will know my heart  ♫

75
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,720
Here. Try some.

76
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,270
Why are you laughing?

77
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,490
It's a secret.

78
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,340
What the heck? I'm not giving you this.

79
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,790
I just figured it out.

80
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,610
Who my guardian angel was.

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,260
Who was it?

82
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,960
♫  Because I'm nervous looking at you because I'm scared that you'll see into my heart  ♫

83
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,810
♫  I circle around the subject of our conversation, do you know my heart that points to you?  ♫

84
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,050
♫  Will you understand me? Will you see me?  ♫

85
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,630
♫  My heart that worries is my heart that loves you  ♫

86
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,750
♫  As if you will definitely come to me  ♫

87
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,350
♫  To the point my heart is strained in nervousness  ♫

88
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,750
♫  I love you  ♫

89
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,240
You told Yoo Cheol everything?!

90
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,330
Well, he was probably going to find out about everything one day.

91
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,870
You didn't tell him about that, right?

92
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,680
No, I didn't tell him.

93
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,390
Martin already ran away.

94
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,050
All I need now is to get my charges dropped.

95
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,510
Make sure to get a hold of Director Ye.

96
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,610
Go back. I have no thoughts of becoming in-laws with a criminal.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,400
This is a present for you.

98
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,070
   

99
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,060
All the shares that were under a borrowed name have been transferred over to Ri El.

100
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,100
The president wants you to take the position of chairman.

101
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,840
If you accept, he said that he'll support you to the best of his ability.

102
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,230
He wants me to become chairman and cover up all of his crimes?

103
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,980
Once you do that, it will be easier for you to do your duties as a chairman.

104
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,740
All you need to do is take Chairman Kim Min Kyu down.

105
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,660
Just getting rid of him is not enough.

106
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,160
He's the type of guy that will rise back up.

107
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,920
We have to make sure he completely loses the will to rise back up.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,150
Are you talking about his illness?

109
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,080
I know what you're thinking.

110
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,550
However, someone's misfortune can become someone else's opportunity.

111
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,560
What you need when that happens is courage to turn a blind eye once.

112
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,520
How can you...

113
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,240
How can you call that courage?

114
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,010
It is courage since not anyone can do such things.

115
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,760
How can you say that, Dad?

116
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,240
What kind of unbelievable excuse is that?

117
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,600
Would I, your daughter,

118
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,930
be happy living that way?!

119
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,440
Everything passes in the end.

120
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,860
It's not such a big deal once it passes by.

121
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,450
 President kept quiet about Martin's crime and got a rebate. 

122
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,230
Well, it's not like he killed a person. Right?

123
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,230
- Yeah. 
 - Does Kim Min Kyu have a chronic disease or something?

124
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:01,030
I think your father and my father will be planning to do something horrific with that.

125
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:06,180
- What? 
- I called you to notify you because I thought that you might not know about it.

126
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,050
You don't know about that, right?

127
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,640
Well, okay, I will call you right back.

128
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:39,030


129
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,290
   

130
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,700
What kind of style would you like?

131
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,750
You would be able to straighten this hair, too. Right?

132
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,160
Of course.

133
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,530
   

134
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,730
When you do a tarot card reading, in asking your question,

135
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,580
it's good to be specific instead of being ambiguous.

136
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,230
I will give you an example. Instead of saying, "Is it possible to love someone?"

137
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,890
You would say, "Would it be possible for this person and me to love?" That kind of question.

138
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:45,030
So then the answer to the question is... Love.

139
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,350
It's a gift.

140
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,210
   

141
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,160
Excuse me, folks. Please allow me to squeeze through for a bit.

142
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,130
I'm here, too, so please respect my presence. All right?

143
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,290
Should I buy you guys the heart lamps, huh?

144
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,430
I shouldn't have fallen asleep then.

145
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,910
I didn't know that something like this would happen while I was sleeping.

146
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,290
Love.

147
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,200
I feel lonely now.

148
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,420
I feel lonely. I think I'm lonely.

149
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,100
Wow, I told you that you would look pretty that way.

150
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,140
Who is that? Do you know her?

151
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,800
That hair and that style. Wow.

152
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,980
Do you know her as well?

153
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,340
Hello— Wow! They say that a person can die if he changes so suddenly.

154
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,140
Drink this and snap out of it.

155
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,610
Her style changed but her character hasn't changed one bit.

156
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,340
I feel like crap so maybe I should go out and dye my hair ash blue?

157
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,780
Go for it. It's not bad.

158
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,640
Sunbae Hoktal, do you want to do it with me?

159
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,070
I'm not the type to get my hair dyed to start with.

160
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,810
Sunbae, you used to do everything I asked up until yesterday so what is... this?

161
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,190
Is it because Sun Hye told you not to do it?

162
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,520
Look!  She is shrugging her shoulders. She's so cheeky.

163
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,050
Sunbae,

164
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,060
please come back to the time when you used to be nice to me.

165
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,950
I feel really lonely on a day like this.

166
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,850
What's up? Is today a special day?

167
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,430
No, not really. Forget it, don't do it. Just don't do anything, okay?

168
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,090
Just don't do it because I'm going to get mad if you do.

169
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,710
Don't you ever do it.

170
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,450
- Oh, you're here. 
 - Yes.

171
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,850
- Oh, you bought juice.
 - Yes.

172
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,980
- Wow, it's delicious. 
- It is.

173
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,650
It looks like the inside of the lab needs to be fixed.

174
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,220
Ah, yes.

175
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,520
- What's wrong? Does your head itch? 
 - No, no.

176
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,260
It's a match made in heaven.

177
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,930
Ssanip, you better go to Yongsan.

178
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,300
Huh? Where now?

179
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,380
Go and buy what's written here, and afterward come straight to the lab.

180
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,160
Oh, get the parts at Yongsan? Okay, Doctor.

181
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,670
Go and come back safely.

182
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,480
- Take your time. 
 - Yup.

183
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,350
- Okay. 
 - I love you.

184
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,140
- Me too. 
- Alrighty.

185
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:35,180
Pi, there is something strange about you today.

186
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,100
- What is it?
 - Well, you seem very different compared to your usual self. And that is...

187
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,190
Your eyes, they have become bigger.

188
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,390
Doctor, it's because I took off my glasses.

189
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,410
Oh, and your forehead looks bigger, too.

190
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,050
It's because I brushed my hair back.

191
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,030
"It's because I brushed my hair back."

192
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,770
Wait, your hair. Your hair, wasn't it originally curly?

193
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,560
I got sick of it so I tried straightening it.

194
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,300
Does it look weird? My hair?

195
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,790
No, it doesn't look weird.

196
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,870
Shall we go now?

197
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,350
It doesn't look weird. It doesn't.

198
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,980
Even if Ji Ah is not by my side, I'm constantly working on walking around by myself.

199
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,740
Since Jo Ji Ah wouldn't be able to stay by you 24/7.

200
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,460
She's not a robot anymore either.

201
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,940
I know, right? That was a huge plus when she was a robot though.

202
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,120
You're not afraid?

203
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,350
I keep on saying that she's by my side

204
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,530
over and over in my head, so it helps a little bit.

205
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,980
It seems like your stats look good for now at least.

206
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,130
As long as you're not suddenly in a situation where you have to come in contact with a lot of people,

207
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,790
then you wouldn't have any problems going through your daily life, right?

208
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,530
Yeah, that won't happen.

209
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,210
Bye for now. Okay.

210
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,950
  
  

211
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,330
I'm back.

212
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,000
Doctor! Sunbae!

213
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,300
Brother?

214
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,650
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid.

215
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,650
Doctor!

216
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,090
Where did everyone go without me? Geesh!

217
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,890
Seriously, these people are just too much.

218
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,790
Man, today's my birthday, too.

219
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,350
Things would be pretty crazy right now if I were in the States.

220
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,320
Seriously, they are so cruel.

221
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,140
- You're here? 
- What the hell? What is this?

222
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,950
Happy birthday!

223
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,290
♫ Happy birthday to you.

224
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,310
♫ Happy birthday to you.

225
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,790
♫ Happy birthday, our dear Ssanip.

226
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,450
♫ Happy birthday to you.

227
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,990
This is so darn childish, you guys.

228
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,040
You didn't need to do a surprise party for me.

229
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,420
Back on the East Coast of the United States, this went out of fashion a long time ago.

230
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,360
I don't normally get touched by things like this anyway.

231
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,570
It's coming now.

232
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,840
You thought that we didn't know about it?

233
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,390
- Hurry up and blow out the candles. 
- Hurry up and blow! Hurry up and blow!

234
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,730
Let's all love each other.

235
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,430
Brother, this is super good. Did you make it yourself?

236
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,060
As expected. I did contribute a little bit— Yes, I did make it.

237
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,890
The cake is super delicious.

238
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,790
I was the one that picked that out.

239
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,320
I also helped him pick it out.

240
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,690
Man, I really want to flip the birthday table upside down for goodness sake.

241
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,300
For you too.

242
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,240
A gift for you.

243
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,320
I wonder what's inside of this  thing?

244
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,780
What could it be?

245
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,650
Yuzu bread.

246
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,690
Brother, what's the meaning of this?

247
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,420
We heard that you always cry whenever you see yuzu bread.

248
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,370
It's because I want to see you cry after eating this.

249
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,430
Seriously, you little!

250
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,320
- It looks like he's crying already. 
- What are you saying?

251
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,590
It looks your eyes are pooling up with tears.

252
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,450
He's crying. He's crying. He's crying.

253
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,980
Then shall I make Ssanip cry again

254
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,660
one more time? With this birthday gift?

255
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,140
Is this a new model? How many terabytes does it have?

256
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,940
The gift is the video inside.

257
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,900
It's a gift from AG-3 that went out into the world for the first time.

258
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,840
 That miss must be so cold. 

259
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,250
  What is she wearing? It's not comforting to see. 

260
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,740
 Don't wander around and quickly go before you end up like me. 

261
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,560
 What does it mean to end up like you? 

262
00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:01,190
 Having no one to meet and no one who is waiting for me. 

263
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,540
 No one's interested in me at all. 

264
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,120
 You know how to take the bus, right? Hurry and go. 

265
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,490
 You worked hard. 

266
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,690
 Thank you. 

267
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,020
 Pretty. 

268
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,760
 AG-3! 

269
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,030
 AG-3, where are you going? 

270
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,850
 AG-3, are you all right? 

271
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,780
 Let's hurry up and go home. 

272
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,340
 Wow. 

273
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,400
We wanted  AG-3 to be a robot who can communicate and share feelings with people.

274
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,730
As you can see, AG-3 was able to grow more than we originally expected.

275
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:35,920
Not only us, but both Kim Min Kyu and Ji Ah guided it well.

276
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,150
Why do we make robots?

277
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:44,340
This memory that AG-3 has left for us is the right answer I believe.

278
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:51,260
I know this could hurt, but I think it's time for us to change the face of AG-3 now, as promised.

279
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,930
We will only leave the pattern of learning that AG-3 mapped out in order to communicate emotionally.

280
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:03,790
But all  the records including the personal video clips of Kim Min Kyu and Jo Ji Ah will have to be entirely deleted.

281
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:11,840
And we should now start developing a new version of the android robot.

282
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,940
Don't you think AG-3 would want us to do just that?

283
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,840
She would want us to make her memory way more beautiful than it is.

284
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:29,450
So with this as the last night, let's send her away well.

285
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,020
♫  Loving with all of your heart  ♫

286
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,060
 I was able to endure through it all up until now because of you. 

287
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,330
 All the patterns that you have left behind will continue on with a new robot. 

288
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,610
 Therefore, we will remember you forever. 

289
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,570
♫  I'm very jealous  ♫

290
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,920
 Good bye, AG-3. 

291
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,010
 I'm so sorry for sending you away to Martin. 

292
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,020
 I really wanted to tell you this. 

293
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,280
 I will say a lot about you to our next robot. 

294
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,710
 You're not going to disappear. 

295
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,430
 I know that I was your favorite at the lab. 

296
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,250
 I will remember you, AG-3. 

297
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,020
 Good bye, AG-3. 

298
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,410
In the last video clip of AG-3,

299
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,360
Chairman Martin confessed that he killed Chairman Park Sung Jin.

300
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,890
It looks like he said that because he let his guard down since AG-3 is a robot.

301
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,950
It looks like Interpol will really like this.

302
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,590
Jang Doo Sam will be definitely be protected now.

303
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,650
I'm glad.

304
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,140
We put the reporter who will release the article on standby. It will be possible to attack right away.

305
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:03,260
When the board meeting is over, the information will leak out to the reporters from someone's mouth anyway.

306
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,620
We can't have blood on our own hands, right?

307
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,950
We will now start the emergency Board of Directors meeting.

308
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:28,820
The agenda is regarding the dismissal of Chairman Kim Min Kyu, and the reason is his health.

309
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,690
He is coming in now.

310
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,690
  
  

311
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:12,900


312
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,180
I am KM Financial's chairman, Kim Min Kyu.

313
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,280
And also...

314
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:37,560
I am a patient with a human allergy.

315
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:44,010
♫  I will take it slow to forget you  ♫

316
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,780
​♫  I will postpone erasing you  ♫

317
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:56,300
​​♫  Oh your facial expressions, those feelings, those stories  ♫

318
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:02,170
​♫  Each one of them are still so clear  ♫

319
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:08,630
♫  I’m gonna love again, the road to forget you  ♫

320
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,450
​♫  On the road to meet with you again  ♫

321
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,810
 The allergy isn't completely cured yet? 

322
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,830
 But is it okay for you to just go around? 

323
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,620
 It's not over yet. You can still— 

324
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,430
 I wonder why that bastard only treats me that way? 

325
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,660
 We were definitely friends, but I wonder how he can do this to me. 

326
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,560
 Don't you think you will need me for that fight? 

327
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,260
 No, it's okay. 

328
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,060
 You'll always be by my side no matter where I am. 

329
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,480
 I don't know why, but I feel like it's going to be okay for now. 

330
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,260
♫  I'm going to walk slowly on the road to break up with you  ♫

331
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,400
​♫  Slowly slowly slowly  ♫
