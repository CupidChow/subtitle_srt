00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,460
I slept. I slept.

3
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,530
Nothing happened as I was sleeping, right? I had a dream.

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,650
The dream was quite unsettling.

5
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,190
Sleep more.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,560
I'm sleeping.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,620
For us... from today, is it...

8
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,860
Day one?

9
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,740
So cute.

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,870
You are cuter.

11
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,350
Here's your Americano.

12
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,790
Yes, thank you.

13
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,320
You're up? Here.

14
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,370
Thank you.

15
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,720
Let's go.

16
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,000
Should we go around one more time?

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,010
We already went around five times. Go home already.

18
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,010
When are you going to come?

19
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,750
I will call after I get some sleep.

20
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,950
That's too bad.

21
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,690
Do you want to start coming to my house for work again?

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,010
Hurry and go in.

23
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,160
- Go in.
 - I'm going.

24
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,260
I'm going.

25
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,820
Go on.

26
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,370
Bye.

27
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,370
​♫  At this rate, I'd rather have them encompass me as I live  ♫

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,250
Go on.

29
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,490
Go in.

30
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,010
You go first.

31
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,360
No, you go in first.

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,730
Go first.

33
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,880
Hurry. I will go after seeing you go in.

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,680
Okay.

35
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,830
- Go in.
 - I'm going. I'm really going.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,630
♫  Not once  ♫

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:37,780
​♫  have I seen a side of you I disliked  ♫

38
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,040
​♫  There's no way I will let you go this easily  ♫

39
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,670
♫  I will take it slow to forget you  ♫

40
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,350
​♫  I will postpone erasing you  ♫

41
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,180
Auntie!

42
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,800
Where did you go yesterday?

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,180
Mt. Hwangmae.

44
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,900
Mt. Hwangmae? Why would you go there?

45
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,280
Auntie, wasn't it cold?

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,980
Not a bit. It was really warm.

47
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,360
Dong Hyun, hit your aunt.

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,890
Come here, come here!

49
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,280
So pretty.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,890
​♫  I have to let them all go now but...  ♫

51
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,650
♫  I don't wanna let you go away  ♫

52
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,940
My president is waiting for you.

53
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,760
Where is my AG-3?

54
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,720
Tomorrow with our contract,

55
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,380
we can send AG-3.

56
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,850
You got lucky. You broke a promise to me.

57
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,030
And your son made me wait. People don't break promises to me.

58
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,740
And they don't make me wait because I don't forgive.

59
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,680
And I never forget.

60
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,820
You know me, Hwang Do Won.

61
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,830
Mister... Mister Martin—

62
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,360
Bring me the AG-3.

63
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,030
We will give it a thorough examination first.

64
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,870
Won't we, Dr. Casey?

65
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,730
Driver Jang.

66
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,660
It's been a long time.

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,870
Dr. Hong.

68
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,230
Just like you, I also respected Chairman Park Sung Jin.

69
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,680
He was someone who was passionate about robots to the point of making a secret development team without anyone in Daeyang Shipbuilding knowing about it.

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,080
But then, if the contract between Chairman Martin and KM Financial is signed tomorrow,

71
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Chairman Park's dream will end.

72
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,100
Please help us.

73
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,220
Chairman Park Sung Jin's death was not an accident.

74
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,970
 Take this money and leave the country. 

75
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,750
 You worked as Chairman Park's driver for 5 years, right? 

76
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,690
 You didn't see anything. 

77
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,860
 Me or Martin or Santa Maria. 

78
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,110
 Chairman Park died from a hit-and-run accident 

79
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,350
 and you almost died, too. You just have to remember that. 

80
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,680
 Chairman Park's accident, did you cause it? 

81
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,810
 Keep this in mind, you don't know anything. 

82
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,730
 That way you and your family can live. 

83
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,440
Did President Hwang Do Won really say that? Do you have a recording of him saying that?

84
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,310
I might die the moment I give you that recording.

85
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,140
I am being chased right now. Please give me time to think about it.

86
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,220
Have you seen Driver Jang?

87
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,630
Why? Did you think I wouldn't know? Let me ask you directly.

88
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,780
Chairman Park Sung Jin...

89
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,230
Did Father kill him?

90
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,570
No.

91
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,770
Who did?

92
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,630
Chairman Kim Min Kyu will be dismissed after the contracts are signed tomorrow.

93
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,870
No, I'm not asking about that right now.

94
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,810
If Kim Min Kyu finds Driver Jang...

95
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,740
what happens next?

96
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,000
   

97
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,760
 I'm sorry, Chairman. 

98
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,060
 Would you be able to last long in the company working like that? 

99
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,800
 I'm really sorry. 

100
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,960
Why did you live like that until now, Kim Min Kyu?

101
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,590
Ah, Team Leader Jo Jin Bae?

102
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,750
Yes, Chairman.

103
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,350
Have you eaten?

104
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,050
Pardon?

105
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,890
No. So... Right now, where are you?

106
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,630
I'm on my way to the court to submit the papers for the lawsuit.

107
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,340
Lawsuit?

108
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,940
Yes. For the Santa Maria Team and my sister Jo Ji Ah.

109
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,500
Ah... that, that, that. Cancel that. I am not doing that... The lawsuit.

110
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,310
You should stick with your decision so that you won't regret it later on.

111
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,000
I won't. I won't be suing them.

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,430
I understand. Then which side are you not suing?

113
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,340
Is it the Santa Maria Team or my sister?

114
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,990
Well... Firstly... It's a hassle, so both.

115
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,530
I understand. I will keep the files, so if you change your mind, tell me.

116
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,110
I won't change my mind. Also the files, just tear them up.

117
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,940
And come to my house right now.

118
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,150
I mean...

119
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,370
Can you come over, please?

120
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,110
Yes, I understand.

121
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,640
Regardless, I had something to report to you anyway.

122
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,450
Okay.

123
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,600
Wow... what is this?

124
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,050
This is my first time experiencing this weird feeling.

125
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,210
I don't think the term "full recovery" will mean much to you anymore.

126
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,250
I would say, depending on your mood, your symptoms can disappear and reappear again.

127
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,530
I think it will make you feel better if you think of your illness as a friend with whom you will have to live with forever.

128
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,880
Make my illness into a friend?

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,970
 You're supposed to appease long-term illnesses as you live. 

130
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,070
 The problem is that medicine won't work that well for you anymore. 

131
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,190
You should be careful until a new one is developed.

132
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,470
I'll keep that in mind.

133
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,260
If you made up with Jo Ji Ah, will you also make up with Santa Maria Team?

134
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,360
That... is a different story.

135
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,730
You were the one that spent time with them.

136
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,270
Therefore, what you feel is the truth.

137
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:25,820
 However, the people I saw were sincerely worried for you. 

138
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,380
Have a seat, Team Leader Jo.

139
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,180
No. I'm fine.

140
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,070
Ah, you don't have to stand that far from me.

141
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,850
Yes. Just as long as you don't touch me.

142
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,760
No. I'm fine.

143
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,580
I'm comfortable like this.

144
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,430
I see.

145
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm not comfortable.

146
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,360
Oh my... That's... not what I meant.

147
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,870
Just... sit down. Please?

148
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,950
Yes. Then I will sit.

149
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:34,870
 Timing and Subtitles by The Robotic Team @ viki.com  

150
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,770
You have done nothing wrong to me, Team Leader Jo.

151
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,840
I will not process your resignation letter.

152
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,800
Although you did make a mistake, I am able to understand.

153
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,910
Therefore, don't act guilty in front of me.

154
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,070
That is exactly what makes me feel uncomfortable.

155
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,970
I... believe you, Team Leader Jo.

156
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,480
Don't believe me.

157
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,760
As a civil rights lawyer, I thought I was a person who couldn't even lie about the tiniest thing.

158
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,480
While doing this work, I realized I was wrong.

159
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,190
People are able to change.

160
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,340
Still... I will believe you.

161
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,320
I will deal with the consequences.

162
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,360
However, my younger sister—

163
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,400
I like your younger sister.

164
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,070
A lot. By any chance, will that fact

165
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,920
become a problem in our relationship right now?

166
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,020
Not at the moment.

167
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,510
Then, you can start.

168
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,980
Director Martin flew into Korea today.

169
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,290
What is the current situation of Santa Maria?

170
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,460
Once the deal is signed, they will lose all of their research results regarding AG-3.

171
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:09,030
Although we were able to locate Jang Doo Sam's whereabouts, we failed to get him to cooperate.

172
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,230
We're going to be there soon.

173
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,060
She is still charging.

174
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,240
Once you arrive, we will pack her up.

175
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,760
If you can, let's end this without trouble.

176
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,360
AG-3.

177
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,160
What type of cow is a cow that can't eat?

178
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,870
I don't know.
 (This is a pun. 'Mo-reu-get-so', which means 'I don't know' and 'so' which is the Korean word for cow) 

179
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,960
You're going to a good place, AG-3.

180
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,060
When you get there, you will find a new master and be happy.

181
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,960
Don't worry.

182
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,790
   

183
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,120
I guess you're telling a happy lie for me today.

184
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,140
 Once the deal is signed, they will lose all of their research results regarding AG-3. 

185
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,390
   

186
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,810
 Ji Ah really didn't know anything, Brother. 

187
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,750
 It's all our— No, it's my fault. 

188
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,590
 I was the one that held her back when she said she wasn't going to help anymore. 

189
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,360
 It's my fault. I'm sorry. 

190
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,220
Young Master! I think you have to come out for a moment.

191
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,140
There's chaos in the guest house right now!

192
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,610
Wow. So interesting.

193
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,620
Beautiful girl.

194
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,530
I'll take you apart and all the technology you're made of.

195
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,570
Team Santa Maria, thank you.

196
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,620
Taking apart AG-3 before signing the contract is against our terms.

197
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,380
Calm down.

198
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,500
Today is our first day of testing.

199
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,610
I'll take her apart after arriving in England.

200
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,430
I can take apart her face by myself.

201
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,310
I want to see the motor assembly behind her skin.

202
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,610
Don't even think about touching her before signing the contract.

203
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:57,850
Ah, sorry. We weren't planning on coming here, but we stopped by for a moment to charge AG-3.

204
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,710
We will start to clear everything out soon.

205
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,870
Where did AG-3 go?

206
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,000
Where did she go?!

207
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,910
They took her away.

208
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,650
I was going to send her away regardless.

209
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,410
How can you just send her away so easily?

210
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,960
Did AG-3 mean that little to Santa Maria?

211
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,820
We didn't send her away easily. It was beyond our control. This is

212
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,910
the only choice we had.

213
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,980
You paid your ex-girlfriend for a part-time job pretending to be robot so you could get ₩500,000,000.

214
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,410
You even conned me saying that this was all a Turing test. Where did all of your guts go?!

215
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,690
You should have found every possible solution that you could try.

216
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,010
I am sorry.

217
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,430
Don't apologize to me. You should be apologizing to your team!

218
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,780
I am sorry, Brother.

219
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,350
We were all on the same page.

220
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,220
I'm... I'm sorry, Brother.

221
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,190
I'm really sorry.

222
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,190
I'm sorry. Really.

223
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,410
Aren't you mad at all in this situation?

224
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,690
If you want to be mad, then let it all out at me.

225
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,900
You also know why we are sending her away.

226
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,920
Are you trying to show me that you had to send her away because of me?

227
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,210
Just do whatever you want to do! I don't care!!

228
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,060
Hey, Kim Min Kyu.

229
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,730
Do you know what it means for the media to go after you in a negative way?

230
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,270
I... No, we know because we have been through it.

231
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,250
That means you will be labeled for the rest of your life.

232
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,700
No matter how sincere you are, no one will listen to you.

233
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,960
The rest of your life will revolve around how the media negatively portrays you.

234
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,880
We... don't want to see the rest of your life being ruined.

235
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,210
Did I ask you to do that?

236
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,880
How is it?

237
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,310
It's amazing.

238
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,020
It's not only the technology that surprises me.

239
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,070
The learning ability is out of this world.

240
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,950
The client will love this.

241
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,710
Will I be upgraded?

242
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,750
Yeah, you'll be a military robot.

243
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,680
The world's most dangerous weapon.

244
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,800
Am I not supposed to live with humans?

245
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,870
You're just a product owned by a man.

246
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,760
This man.

247
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,810
You do not exist as a living creature.

248
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,210
If you've checked enough, I will keep AG-3 before the contract tomorrow.

249
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,390
To avoid being tracked, let me take out the GPS before you take it.

250
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,780
   

251
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,220
♫  Please don't frown  ♫

252
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,130
♫  Everyone's going through a hard time  ♫

253
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,190
♫  For the hard times  ♫

254
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,190
Did you sleep a bit?

255
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,800
I just woke up. What about you?

256
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,820
I had a lot of work.

257
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,160
Why are you laughing?

258
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,360
You are really CEO Jo.

259
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,320
You're happy?

260
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,810
Yeah, I'm really happy.

261
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,560
No wonder, I felt so used to talking to you on the phone.

262
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,710
Is that so?

263
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,090
When you switched your phone number, I was really sad.

264
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,260
You changed it because of me, right?

265
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,000
I felt like I would actually run to you if I ever got a call from you again.

266
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,060
Did something happen?

267
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,280
Should I go there now?

268
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:18,360
No. Later at night. I have things to do now.

269
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,660
The team follows the leader and the leader takes all of the responsibility.

270
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,950
So... all responsibility for this situation lies with you.

271
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:33,020
I know. I also know what words you want to hear.

272
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,950
So say it. Just the truth.

273
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,800
Jo Ji Ah... was my first love.

274
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:55,030
But then one day... without telling me a reason, she just left.

275
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:02,010
I probably made AG-3's face as Ji Ah's face to try to find the answer.

276
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,480
I found that answer, now I can understand Ji Ah,

277
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,780
and more than that, I got to know myself more.

278
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,620
This is why a chapter of my life is done.

279
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,590
On Geoje Island, you two looked very good together.

280
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,820
I'm sincere.

281
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,080
You two looked so good together that I wanted to tell you everything at that moment.

282
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,380
But I lost the chance again.

283
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,270
I'm sorry.

284
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:51,370
The decisive moment always seems to pass as I hesitate.

285
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,780
I am canceling the lawsuit.

286
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,300
I will not send AG-3, and I will stop that contract tomorrow no matter what.

287
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,410
The reason is not because I have forgiven you.

288
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,850
It's for KM Financial's sake.

289
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,880
Yes.

290
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,160
President, the chairman is here.

291
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,010
You came to see me?

292
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,350
As I live, a day like this comes.

293
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,790
So... what's your purpose for coming?

294
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,010
I'm thinking about resigning from the chairman position.

295
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,920
I'll also stay out of management decisions.

296
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,100
In return, I have a condition.

297
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,920
Condition?

298
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,090
Sell the Santa Maria Team to me.

299
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,860
You decide to give up on KM Financial, yet you want Santa Maria, the team that deceived you?

300
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,340
I don't think it's a bad deal.

301
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,700
It wasn't a bad deal when I didn't know about your illness.

302
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,320
Either way, your body's condition is not good enough for you to carry out your duties.

303
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:46,190
All this time, I gained profit for KM Financial with this body.

304
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,400
What would happen if the world knew about your illness?

305
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,260
Do you think that you will be able to endure it like right now?

306
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm begging you.

307
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,580
Santa Maria will be sold to Bold Group by tomorrow.

308
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,040
Doctor Hong has already agreed to this.

309
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,400
Now what's left is for you is to accept it.

310
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,260
Min Kyu, don't you think a voluntary resignation from the chairman position is better?

311
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,530
Is something wrong with your head?

312
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:33,090
In return for giving up KM Financial, you want Santa Maria?

313
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,740
Those people who made you a fool behind your back?

314
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,840
Because they're worth that much.

315
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,710
Worth? What worth do they have?

316
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,490
Are they worth it because they are able to scam so flawlessly?

317
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:55,050
You have been giving me such a hard time because of that one incident that happened when I was younger.

318
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,030
But you're saying those people are worth protecting with all of your assets on the line?

319
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,140
Are you really crazy?

320
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,110
My mind is sound. As you know, my calculations are precise.

321
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,070
Listen closely, Yoo Cheol.

322
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:19,400
Those people... gave up all that they had for me.

323
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:26,150
You and your father... will never understand them.

324
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,150
   

325
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,200
I won't make it long.

326
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,650
Let's pretend that the talk about you and Ri El's engagement never happened.

327
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,710
I-I... was careless.

328
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,210
You were very careless.

329
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,550
Director Martin will be signing the contract tomorrow.

330
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:18,610
I'm sure you know very well what is going to happen after he signs that contract.

331
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,210
For KM Financial, we have to stop it from happening no matter what.

332
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,390
I'll gather the board members for an emergency meeting.

333
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,220
Please give me support.

334
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,420
Ri El and Yoo Cheol will be getting married soon.

335
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,810
This is my answer.

336
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,910
Once the contract is signed tomorrow with Bold Group,

337
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,260
I'm going to proceed with your marriage with Yoo Cheol.

338
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,750
Dad, I already told you to let me go.

339
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,500
I don't want to continue living like this anymore.

340
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,030
You always acknowledged Min Kyu's ability.

341
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,800
You thought of him as a family member for fifteen years,

342
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,990
so how can you turn on him in a matter of a day?

343
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,460
Family? Who?

344
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,740
Kim Min Kyu?

345
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:11,420
Dad, were you always supporting Min Kyu with that type of mindset?

346
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,790
Do you not feel bad for Min Kyu?

347
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,890
Yes, this is Reporter Park.

348
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,320
I just received your email.

349
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,270
This is interesting.

350
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,660
Once this goes public, it will be the most searched article.

351
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,360
I'm sure people will be talking about it for a while.

352
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,540
I will be on standby so just give me the sign.

353
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,780
   

354
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,550
Yes.

355
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,490
  
  

356
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,450
What the hell!

357

358
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,750
Let's go home.

359
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,470
♫  I will take it slow to forget you  ♫

360
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:45,260
​♫  I will postpone erasing you  ♫

361
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,600
​​♫  Oh your facial expressions  ♫

362
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,770
​​♫  Those feelings, those stories  ♫

363
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:57,530
​♫  Each one of them is still so clear  ♫

364
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:03,740
♫  I’m gonna love again, the road to forget you  ♫

365
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:09,950
​♫  On the road to meet with you again  ♫

366
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,000
​♫  On the road to meet with you again  ♫
