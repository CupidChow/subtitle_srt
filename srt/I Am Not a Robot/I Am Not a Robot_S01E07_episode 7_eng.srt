1
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,370
Be gentle, be gentle. You can do it. 
    

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,790
Oh, careful, careful.

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,850
Wow! Yes!

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,720
- Okay, last one! 
- Here, one more card. Last one. 
- One more?

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,430
I'll try.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,220
Careful, careful.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,460
Nice!

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,010
Last one! Last one!

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,750
- If you just get this one...
 - This is the last one. Please...

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,970
You can do it!

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Just one more time!

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,660
Min Kyu, you can do this!

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,130
Oh no! What do I do?

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,670
It's okay, Min Kyu.

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,620
Look, look, Min Kyu. I'll show you something cool.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,270
Here...

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,930
Now...

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,190
Wow! Hey, why are you hiding it?

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,410
It's Dad's secret!!

20
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,110
- Aww, no fair. 
- Min Kyu, find out what it is.

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,120
 Some moments become heart piercing memories. 

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,900
Come here. No, no, no!

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,380
You can't!

24
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,250
From here! Yeah!!

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,010
♫  Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! 

26
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,780
♫  Happy birthday to Min Kyu.  

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,070
♫  Happy birthday to you! 

28
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,750
Make a wish.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,930
Happy birthday.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,720
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,960
Happy birthday, Min Kyu.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,020
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,600
It's so pretty.

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,990
It's really pretty.

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,560
You rascal-- Hey! If you get caught I'll--

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,760
You should be careful.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,700
Come here!

38
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,200
- You should give it back. 
- Stop there!

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,830
Be careful, kids.

40
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,680
You'll get hurt. Be careful, you two.

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,700
Give it back to him, quickly.

42
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,330
- Whoa!
 - Whoa!

43
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,630
Wow! Look at that!

44
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:52,270
 Some moments become beautiful memories that will never come again. 

45
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,000
- Min Kyu, did you have fun today? 
 - Yes.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,700
Should we play the end character name with Dad?
 (A game where you have to say a new word that starts with the last syllable of the previous word) 

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,700
Shall I start?

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,860
- Sujeo (utencil) 
- Jeo?

49
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,980
- Jeo... Jeochook (savings). 
- Savings?

50
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,570
- Chookha (congrats). 
- Congrats?

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,390
Ha... neul! (Sky)

52
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,230
Sky?

53
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,940
 And... some moments... 

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,390
Mom. Mom. Mom!

55
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,790
Mister. Mom... My dad... My mom...

56
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,840
Min Kyu, come to your senses and

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,250
listen to Mister's words carefully.

58
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,160
You... You are my son now.

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Mister and Yoo Cheol will be your family.

60
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,260
So today, let's send Mom and Dad away well.

61
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,280
Right now, everyone is waiting for you.

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,400
 The accident— 

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,080
 Vice Chairman! 

65
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,640
- What a sudden loss.
 -  You're right. What a pity.

66
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,070
Secretary Yoon.

67
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,520
Yeah. Don't get up, stay seated.

68
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,450
It's hard, isn't it?

69
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,120
If only I had followed you guys that day.

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,060
Okay. Stay strong.

71
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,440
Min Kyu,

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,340
this is procedural for the funeral. Can you sign this document?

73
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,760
That way we can send Dad off easily.

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,130
- Yes.
 - Good.

75
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,180
I... I need to use the restroom for a moment.

76
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,020
Oh, okay. Go quickly.

77
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,280
   

78
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,990
   

79
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,810
It looks like you don't need to worry too much. I told him well,

80
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,660
so I think he will sign without suspicion.

81
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,990
Is that so? Then make sure you take care of that well.

82
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,340
Yes. I understand.

83
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,810
  
   

84
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,280
- Yes, please take care of me well. 
- We will do our best.

85
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,620
- CEO Kim. 
- President.

86
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,500
- You know, right? Please continue to work hard in the future. 
- I will do my utmost.

87
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,390
Thank you.

88
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,660
- Now, directors, let's make a reliable company together. Take good care of me.
 - Take good care of us.

89
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,260
Min Kyu!

90
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,630
Won't you live with me? Let's live together.

91
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,760
I can be your big brother and you can be my little brother.

92
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,550
You don't want to? Then, you can be the big brother and I can be the little brother. Is it good now?

93
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,590
Sign here.

94
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,300
Dad said that you have to sign here in order for us to live together.

95
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,480
My dad said that we're a family now.

96
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,540
   

97
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,260
   

98
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,080
  
   

99
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,500
Cheer up, friend.

100
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,520
No, wait. We're family now.

101
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,000
Ah! Ah! Get away from me! Go away!

102
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,650
Did he sign it?

103
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,050
Yes, but Min Kyu is a little weird.

104
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,490
   
   

105
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,990
Are we living with Min Kyu starting tomorrow?

106
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,960
It seems like Min Kyu likes being alone.

107
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:40,730
 Why did God leave so many of these heart piercing memories with me? 

108
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,710
 That beautiful memory of that perfect day. 

109
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,930
 What purpose does it have? 

110
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,520
 Recollection... 

111
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,230
 and memory... 

112
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,460
 have become punishment 

113
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,830
 to me. 

114
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,660
- Master, it seems like you had a nightmare. 
- Yes.

115
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,780
Humans...

116
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,960
were doubly stabbing me in the back in my dream.

117
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,770
Is your body okay?

118
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,310
My body?

119
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,210
You little punk!

120
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,350
You did it! You recognized me.

121
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,210
And you also gave me a shot.

122
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,360
It would be a disgrace for a robot to not recognize its own master.

123
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,470
- You weren't scared? 
- I'm a robot, so what is there to be scared of?

124
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,810
You didn't think I was like a monster or anything?

125
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,990
It doesn't matter what you look like since you are my master either way.

126
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,810
Exactly! That's exactly it!

127
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,410
You are so much better than that dog from before.

128
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,720
It's quite a skill to recognize me.

129
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,050
You can totally be proud of that.

130
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,190
 It's a compliment but why does it sound more like an insult? 

131
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,710
How adorable. Just look at how adorable you are.

132
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,940
Then are you going to raise my rank?

133
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,530
Of course, I am! Starting from today, you've been promoted to a Lovely.

134
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,990
Master, you can't take that back. Okay?

135
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,280
Okay. No take backs.

136
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,410
Is your thigh all right?

137
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,830
It was possible for me to inject it,

138
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,940
but Master,  taking it out is beyond my capabilities.

139
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,760
Your shoulder, too...

140
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,970
You. I cancel your promotion.

141
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,470
But Master, it's not polite for you to take back what you've already given.

142
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,600
Then what about this?! Is this a polite thing to do, huh?!

143
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,170
Your allergy is very severe.

144
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,010
Wow, now you change the subject?

145
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,350
What kind of allergy is it?

146
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,020
- Peanut? Shellfish? Egg? 
- It's a secret.

147
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,660
Keeping secrets between friends is bad.

148
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,140
Snap out of it. You are in operation mode right now.

149
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,770
Would you like me to turn on friend mode?

150
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,280
You need a friend right now, huh?

151
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,270
I should ask them to open her head

152
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,980
and take a look to fix her circuits.

153
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,430
Go away! I need to get more sleep.

154
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,240
Yes, Master.

155
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,280
Master, by the way, isn't the top of your foot uncomfortable?

156
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,810
That happened because my hand slipped.

157
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,720
Seriously, you punk!

158
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,840
Oops, sorry Sunba—

159
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,790
No. I am on the same rank now.

160
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,900
As Lovelies, let's get along well.

161
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,530
Why play hard to get?

162
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,530
 There is already something on the box. And there is no way I will be able to find another one. 

163
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,690
 Yet, you are asking me to pay up? 

164
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,070
I really was the crazy psychopath.

165
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,010
 I don't laugh when I'm with others. 

166
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,280
 I want to come off as scary 

167
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,310
 so they won't dare to do anything to me. 

168
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,720
 Humans... 

169
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,570
 were doubly stabbing me in the back in my dream. 

170
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,080
He must have been painfully stabbed with a dagger.

171
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,410
His allergy is so severe, too.

172
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,640
I wonder what kind of allergy it is.

173
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,220
He looks like a person without anything to envy about in this world, but

174
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,530
it seems like his life isn't as easy as it looks.

175
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,270
 Take off your clothes. 

176
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,710
Could it be that this punk is a perverted psychopath?

177
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,360
You went out with Baton yesterday, right? But why didn't you tell me?!

178
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,880
I thought you were watching everything, of course.

179
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,110
No wonder it was quiet in my ears.

180
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,110
- He didn't do anything weird to you? 
- What weird thing?

181
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,570
He didn't seem mentally sound.

182
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,340
He is normal! He is different than what you see on the surface.

183
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,480
He doesn't lie and he is unexpectedly a bit of a softie.

184
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,970
Why are you taking Baton's side suddenly?

185
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,670
Because he is my master. So, of course, I should take his side.

186
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,910
I am your master, okay?

187
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,350
You're ridiculous. Snap out of it! AG-3 is over there.

188
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,150
Anyway, don't thoughtlessly follow him next time.

189
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,900
And also don't mindlessly go inside of his bedroom, either!

190
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,750
And why do you leave him alone when he touches you?

191
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,830
Man, I'm getting scolded for the wrong things again.

192
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,700
I thought you would get mad at me for injecting him instead.

193
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,850
Yes, I'm talking about that shot. Are you a paramedic or what?!

194
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,240
Why did you inject him?

195
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,730
When an allergic reaction is severe, there's a possibility of death due to shock.

196
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,290
So what I did was something to be praised for.

197
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,430
And Doctor, that's not our problem right now.

198
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,780
 - Yes, Chairman. 
 - That Team Leader Jo is

199
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,080
your elder brother? Oh my god!

200
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,350
It's oh my god for me, too.

201
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,930
If my brother catches me working this part-time job, he might actually faint since his lungs are in poor condition.

202
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,510
So help me not to get caught.

203
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,940
We can hack the surveillance camera. When your brother comes, we can see right away.

204
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,880
Oh, what a relief!

205
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,890
But where is Sister Pi?

206
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,350
I have to take the corset off.

207
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,710
What the heck is this?

208
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,490
- You want us to paint? 
 - All of this?

209
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,650
No.

210
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,430
Paint all of this side and continue all the way over there.

211
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,650
You have to paint over at least three times

212
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,180
for it to be very waterproof.

213
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,720
We're all living here together so think of this as your own home.

214
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,700
Do your best, okay?

215
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,950
You two take care of the paint job.

216
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,830
Sir! Sir!

217
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,670
I am busy so I must—

218
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,310
That's right! You can have those two men do the paint job.

219
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,120
And you should come and help me, pretty doctor.

220
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,200
When you go over to the storage room over there, there's no electricity.

221
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
I don't know the reason why though.

222
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,120
The house is very old, so there is so much work to be done.

223
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,750
But now I have all these young folks around me,

224
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,510
so I feel so confident about everything.

225
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,850
Oh, yes.

226
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,470
I feel like Hell's Gate has opened up before us.

227
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,500
The machine, the machine. We shouldn't have fixed the machine for him.

228
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,830
Don't you agree, Sunbae Hoktal?

229
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,170
Just take it off.

230
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,870
Are you messing with me now? How can I take this off by myself?

231
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,870
Do you want me to help you?

232
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,220
Don't look this way. Turn your head around!

233
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,780
I won't look, I won't!

234
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,980
- What are you doing?! Turn your head around! 
- All right, I won't look! Gosh, all I did was put on a relief patch.

235
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,130
Are you done yet?!

236
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,390
Don't misunderstand here.

237
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,040
You are no longer a woman to me—

238
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,990
I'll be back tonight!

239
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,870
So empty.

240
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,280
That's so amazing! That's so crazy!

241
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,920
How is that crazy psycho your brother's boss?

242
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,580
And on top of that, you saved the life of that psychopath again?

243
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,030
There is some kind of cosmic energy that is gathering to connect you with that psychopath.

244
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,440
Don't you think?

245
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,500
No, you're wrong. That man has welcomed his flowery first love yesterday.

246
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,460
That man?

247
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,500
When did that crazy psychopath become "that man?"

248
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,430
Starting from today. With enlightenment of repentance.

249
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,330
Make a move on him then. You said he's a man.

250
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,770
First love is meant to be broken anyway.

251
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,420
- But I'm a robot. 
- Who cares?

252
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,560
If he pursues you, saying that he likes you even though you're a robot,

253
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,220
then this would definitely be something beyond human and matter.

254
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,330
Some cosmic love that we all have to accept.

255
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,390
Are you making fun of me?

256
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,700
But hey, your ex boyfriend doesn't feel anything even if you are by his side?

257
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,350
No, he doesn't see me as a woman any longer.

258
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,660
He didn't have to tell you that.

259
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,360
That's more suspicious though.

260
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,150
Bad girl.

261
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,910
Who, me?

262
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,610
Not you, I'm talking about Jo Ji Ah.

263
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,380
Add a subject. Otherwise, there will be an input error.

264
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,170
Bad girl.

265
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,960
Are you talking about Jo Ji Ah?

266
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,850
No, I'm talking about you!

267
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,790
My goodness...

268
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,250
- Did you get all of the petitions? 
- Yeah.

269
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,080
Excluding those who were involved in embezzlement, I got a total of three.

270
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,170
Thanks a lot. If I win in the final rounds,

271
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,010
I will set up your four insurances as a bonus.

272
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,400
But you were the one who told me that the petition won't work.

273
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,580
I did say that but...

274
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,910
Seeing him, there are some unique sides to him,

275
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,680
but he doesn't seem completely abnormal.

276
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,290
And I also think that ink incident is also my misunderstanding as well.

277
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,240
AG-3, come here.

278
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,930
Right. It left awhile ago.

279
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,350
The recovery was faster? By how much?

280
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,750
About one to two hours? But the recovery was definitely faster than usual.

281
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,610
That's probably an outlier or the reaction was weak.

282
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,760
No... One more second and I would have died.

283
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,540
But you didn't die.

284
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,780
Doctor!

285
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,860
- I'm leaving for England tomorrow for a conference. It'll be hard to answer calls right away.
 - Whatever.

286
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,220
But it's really different than usual. I feel more clear after waking up, too.

287
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,150
♫  Don't wrinkle up your face  ♫

288
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,280
Yes, Mast—

289
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,960
Are you crazy?!

290
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,210
Hello?

291
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,690
The necklace, I got it.

292
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,650
And?

293
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:40,460
That hammer you were holding in the photo back then. There's no way you shattered my necklace with that,

294
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,620
 and sent it in that condition. Right? 

295
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,650
If that's the case, tell me first so I can prepare my heart.

296
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,250
I told you I sent it.

297
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,980
- How? 
 - Well.

298
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,090
How can I believe that?

299
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,340
Just believe me. When someone makes their heart known to—

300
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,490
Why would you make your heart known to me? I'm not interested in you, CEO Jo.

301
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,760
Did I ask you to take interest?

302
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,170
Why are you getting angry? I'm just asking you to tell me the truth.

303
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,220
So I told you the truth. I sent it well.

304
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,820
So how am I supposed to trust that? Even a loan needs a guarantee.

305
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,590
Wait. I won't believe anything you say anyway.

306
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,410
So why do I keep responding to you on this call?

307
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,570
It's a waste of my precious time. I'm hanging up.

308
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,210
Hello— Hel— Hey, hey!

309
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,960
You're the one who called me, you psycho!

310
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,010
That psycho came back.

311
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,720
How is it that he has such a talent for making people go nuts?

312
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,570
I'm the crazy wench for thinking you were normal for a brief moment. I am!

313
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,620
I will make the final attack tomorrow with this.

314
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,110
- Will he fall for it?
 - He's sick.

315
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,090
When someone's sick, they become open-minded and sentimental.

316
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,690
Right at that time, I swoop in with a hand-written letter filled with emotion.

317
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,310
Send it today and it'll arrive tomorrow. Leave it to me.

318
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,820
You're sure Jin Bae oppa's not onto you at all, right?

319
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,820
Of course. You know how my brother is. He only knows about studying so he's slow.

320
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,890
 It's a high-tech material. 

321
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,660
 It's used to fabricate helmets... 

322
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,400
 That face is definitely my little sister's. 

323
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,370
 In German? 

324
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,690
Flubber, a viscoelastic material that simultaneously has properties of...

325
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,490
Have you seen something like this before, Team Leader Jo?

326
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,230
No, what is this?

327
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,180
- It's a robot.
- A robot?

328
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,270
Yes, it seems like a human though, doesn't it? But it's a robot.

329
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,500
 Even if Baton is quite capable, it's very obvious that the son of the current president will win, don't you think? 

330
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,490
This video came in internally but I wasn't sure to which transaction it was linked.

331
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,220
I wanted to ask you if you knew anything.

332
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,610
No, I don't know at all.

333
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,550
If you find any information about this robot, please let me know.

334
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,640
Sure.

335
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,190
To tell you the truth, only you and I are aware that this robot exists.

336
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,490
Don't you think that was rash?

337
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,650
Min Kyu's words keep getting into my head.

338
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,460
But don't worry. I made sure that Team Leader Jo wouldn't be able to speak about it freely.

339
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,840
It seemed like Team Leader Jo doesn't have an idea about AG-3 though.

340
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,170
He doesn't have the look of being completely clueless about it either.

341
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,180
What about the tracking?

342
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,980
There.

343
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,970
Found you, sucker.

344
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,410
Help me look up a car.

345
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,630
Car owner. The car owner. Yes.

346
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,020
- My shoulders... 
- An unknown caller.

347
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,170
I'm so busy so why would I take it.

348
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,670
 The person you have called is not answering... 

349
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,990
He's not answering, Uncle.

350
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,500
They are quite cautious. Expected of geniuses.

351
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,540
But we've got a trick up our sleeves.

352
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,560
Do you think they'll come?

353
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,040
They will definitely come.

354
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,010
Everyone comes when they hear that a package has arrived. I know from personal experience.

355
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,160
No. I meant her.

356
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,550
There they come.

357
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,050
Is that the part from Africa?

358
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,930
Strange, I told them to send it to the new address.

359
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,350
No, it's not the part. This is a freebie.

360
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,640
Yeah? I thought so.

361
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
One, two, three.

362
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,170
Follow them.

363
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,450
Follow them furtively.

364
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,190
Where did they go?

365
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,450
- Where did they go?
 - You punk. Following them... You should have been closer.

366
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,620
- Over there? Nope.
 - No, it's not.

367
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,070
 My father told me to marry you. 

368
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:35,190
 My answer was... Why not? 

369
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,610
 Although this is an arranged marriage, we should try going on dates. Right? 

370
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,420
 Let's go on just 3 dates. 

371
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,360
 It doesn't matter. 

372
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,430
♫  At the same time  ♫

373
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,410
 If I can confirm that I'm able to kiss you, then I'm down for this marriage. 

374
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,630
♫  you and I  ♫

375
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,920
I'm going nuts.

376
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,040
I see you need a friend right now.

377
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,130
Friend, my butt.

378
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,050
Right, Lovely?

379
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,950
Yeah, it's not that I need a friend right now. I need someone to talk to.

380
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,830
Okay. That's the reason I'm going there.

381
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,860
My intuition is telling me that this human is definitely not normal.

382
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,920
But Jo Ji Ah says he's normal. His allergy is severe.

383
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,230
Is this why he has perverted psycho tendencies?

384
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,350
Should I send her there tomorrow, or not?

385
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,880
Wow. I can't lift my arm.

386
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,290
I can't move my neck.

387
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,750
He won't give us work tomorrow, too. Right?

388
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,100
Before we finish the development, I'll be half dead already.

389
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,300
At least we got some delicious kimchi stew.

390
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,600
Does it make sense that the three of us get paid with kimchi stew? Does it?

391
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,950
With our brains—

392
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,300
Take off your clothes so I can put on some salon pas.

393
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,800
Why did you take it from me?

394
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,030
I'm going to put it on for them.

395
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,990
Sure, whatever.

396
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,200
We'll put it on ourselves.

397
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,790
Yes, we'll do that.

398
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,490
What? What are they doing inside?

399
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,500
What do I do?

400
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,490
Sunbae Hoktal, don't make those kinds of noises. If someone heard, they'd think something rated-R was going on in here.

401
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,220
Seriously. I'm so ashamed with Ji Ah here.

402
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,410
Hey! Hey! Hey!

403
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,770
What the heck?

404
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,710
 Hey... 

405
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,390
They said she was charging her battery but it sounds like she's having a lot of fun.

406
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,980
My back! It hurts!

407
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,180
Stop laughing already. Otherwise, your bolt will probably fall out.

408
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,870
And you... You feel like laughing even though your master isn't around?

409
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,130
That ingrate robot!

410
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,800
  Don't make noises together. It's weirder when you do it together. 

411
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,660
I think I should go to the sauna.

412
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,960
I heard it from somewhere that swimming is good for muscle pain.

413
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,830
- Swimming?
 - Swimming?

414
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,640
It eases pain.

415
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,560
But that light over there has been on for a while now. What is it?

416
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:30,730
