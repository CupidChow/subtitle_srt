1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,930
It's all good now. I don't see him. Breathe.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,110
Man, I'm dying here.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,180
Why did you come to where I was? Did you follow me by chance?

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,420
I almost got caught earlier for goodness sake!

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,880
Didn't I tell you not to mindlessly follow him?

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,530
- Why did you follow him around just to be treated like that? 
 - What are you talking about?

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,640
What are you talking about, huh? You, earlier, that,

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,450
kissing, forehead, that guy, there—

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,990
Never mind. Forget about it. Are you protesting or something?

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,750
What? Why would I?

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,430
Why are you overdoing it? Why don't you want to listen to me?

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,700
Fine. I'm sorry, all right?

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,820
I'm going to get some shut eye now, so wake me up when we get there.

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,560
How can you fall asleep in a situation like this?

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,300
Fine, sleep then.

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:04,710


17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,270
What have I done?

18
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,690
Are we here?

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,250
What the heck? But this is is my house.

20
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,530
I had a feeling that you still lived here.

21
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,490
But why did you bring me here instead of that house?

22
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,620
I will bring your stuff for you and take my stuff from you then.

23
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,090
What are you talking about? Why?

24
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,210
The test is over.

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,710
Your part-time is over as of today.

26
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,840
It's true. I bumped into all kinds of people today

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,970
but I felt perfectly fine.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm telling you that I really didn't have any reactions!

29
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,750
Doctor, what do I have to do for you to believe me?

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,440
Look. No scars, right?

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,380
No way!

32
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,730
 There is no way that your body can return to a normal state this quickly without medication. 

33
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,430
That's what I'm saying!

34
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,990
It's been 15 years.

35
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,920
 We purchased all kinds of medications in the world and tried them out, but they were no use. 

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,090
But there's a change for the first time after all these years. And on top of that, it's an amazing change!

37
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,840
You are saying that this is all because of that robot in the video clip you've sent me?

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,770
Yes! Well, I don't know the reason... though.

39
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,220
You brought in a robot that looks exactly like a human into your house,

40
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,610
and whenever you have that robot next you, you don't get any allergic reactions?

41
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,780
Exactly!

42
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,590
 How long has it been since you brought that robot into your home? 

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,840
About....10 days...

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,740
What have you been doing with that robot in those 10 days?

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,120
What did we do? We just stayed home.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,050
So what did you guys do together?

47
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,500
Not much.

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,820
 Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you. 

49
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,070
 This is a miracle. A miracle occurred for you, Patient Kim Min Kyu. 

50
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,240
 First of all, think about all of the big and small moments 

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,420
 that might have triggered a change from the moment you brought the robot home until now. 

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,980
 Even if it's something trivial, that would be fine, too.   

53
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,220
You might be able to figure it out, by connecting all of those moments together,

54
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,160
how you were able to heal.

55
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,050
It's been so long, hasn't it?

56
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,850
So adorable.

57
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,780
- Please open the door.
 - Listen to your mother, sweetie.

58
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,970
Jo Ji Ah, you did all you could.

59
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,950
My part-time job has ended, so leave it up to the heavens to take care of the final screening.

60
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,590
There's no way that he wouldn't open up the final screening after reading that tear-jerking petition.

61
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,590
Feeling the heat on my back feels great.

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,710
Why are you so cute, you sweet little adorable thing?

63
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,200
Jo Ji Ah, snap out of it! Snap out of it now! You can do it.

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Rock, paper, scissors!

65
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,460
You're so mean!

66
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,020
So hot.

67
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,780
What's the meaning of that kiss anyway?

68
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,790
Is he treating me like a little kid or an actual woman?

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,510
You were just a robot to that man.

70
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,220
Just a robot.

71
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,490
- Please kiss me. 
- Kiss m--

72
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,450
Please kiss me, darling.

73
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,500
You're so adorable.

74
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,060
- It's so cold. 
- You're cold.

75
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,780
So cold...

76
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,800
 You freaking bastard! You think you are lost in the galaxy of Andromeda? 

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,870
 Would you like me to help you find your way back?! The feeling of your head flying downward 

78
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,840
 when bungee jumping in the Grand Canyon. Do you want me to help you feel it from head to toe, 

79
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,120
 you freaking jerk! 

80
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,550
I wonder if that was the miraculous moment?

81
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,240
Or could it be starting from then on?

82
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,160
♫  Would you understand me  ♫

83
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,700
 Why couldn't you recognize me? 

84
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,540
 Ah. It's Master. 

85
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,090
 Ah, it's a cat. 

86
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,150
 Ah, Maste— Ca— Mas— C— M— 

87
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,810
 Master's smiling. 

88
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,500
She was so cute at that time.

89
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,120
♫  I love you  ♫

90
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,000
So cu— But cuteness doesn't make miracles happen.

91
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,600
- Yes, Doctor. 
- Patient Kim Min Kyu,

92
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,880
is that robot really like a human being?

93
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,590
- Yes. 
- Have you ever told that robot about your worries and concerns?

94
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,010
Yes.

95
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,930
Did you tell it about your sickness as well?

96
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,450
Well...

97
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,360
Kind of?

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,030
You said you were together for 10 days, right?

99
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,610
So how do you think you'll feel if you can't see the robot for 10 days?

100
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,100
Well...

101
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,780
Well... I'll... I'll miss... her

102
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,600
a lit... tle but 10 days is too long.

103
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,280
 It seems like you and that robot have built a friendship. 

104
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,640
 It seems like that's the reason for the miracle. 

105
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,380
  Just who is it? Who is the person that dares to do something to you?  

106
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,850
 Tell them to come here and I'll take care of them all! 

107
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,220
 Still, 

108
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,340
 you grew up really well, Master. 

109
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,970
 A relationship is planting your roots 

110
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,380
 in someone's heart. 

111
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,650
  
   

112
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,580
 The part arrived but there is a bit of a problem. 

113
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,050
Uncle, that's the right car, isn't it?

114
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,420
Yes, it is.

115
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,270
But I don't think that's the same guy from before.

116
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,120
But why does he look so familiar?

117
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,770
   

118
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,730
That's him, right? That's Professor Hong Baek Gyun for sure, right?!

119
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,770
That's him. He looks exactly the same as in the photo.

120
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,130
He's leaving. He's leaving!

121
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,610
Get ready! Hold on a minute!

122
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,930
You little punks, I've got you now.

123
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,260
Why isn't he answering his phone when it isn't even turned off?

124
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,990
Professor!

125
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,170
 I could also kiss her. 

126
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,670
This bastard.

127
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,840
This guy Baton is very perverted on the inside.

128
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,850
He was weird from the start.

129
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,320
There were a lot of instances where she could've been caught for being human. What happened?

130
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,430
He just skipped over it.

131
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,700
He only had that in his mind.

132
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,880
So he wouldn't have been able to see through them.

133
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,580
I can't send AG-3 to that kind of person.

134
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,520
Of course, you can't.

135
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,500
Of course.

136
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,970
That's Jo Ji Ah.

137
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,670
That proves my point even more.

138
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,170
Wait... a second. If he did that to a human, isn't that  not  perverted?

139
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,550
If he finds out that she's a human and not a robot,

140
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,820
he could end up with her and have a happy ending together.

141
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,930
He did that knowing that she's a robot.

142
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,700
And once we fix AG-3, she will face the same treatment.

143
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,630
- Is that okay?
 - Of course not.

144
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,620
We can't let AG-3 be treated like that.

145
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,190
That is true.

146
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,550
But we have to send her tomorrow morning.

147
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,280
If not, he will kick us out with his annoying attitude.

148
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
Why would we get kicked out?

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We would be leaving.

150
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,720
 Coincidentally without knowing, you have been training with that robot to assimilate yourself back into the human world. 

151
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,390
 Spend more time and do more things with the robot. 

152
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,960
 Then don't you think you will see a miracle of complete healing? 

153
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,130
   

154
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,240
AG-3.

155
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,550
My treasure.

156
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,760
 So you're saying 

157
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,540
 that you can't do anything without me? 

158
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,860
 Take care of your treasure well. 

159
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,140
I should not have told her that she's my treasure yesterday.

160
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,140
I have to see her sass from now on.

161
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,680
   

162
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,060
CEO Hwang, let's go drink tonight.

163
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,390
Well, is it bad or good? Which occasion?

164
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,160
I met Kim Min Kyu yesterday.

165
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,350
Okay, and?

166
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,070
How can he dump someone like me?

167
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,560
- What's with that smile? Are you saying I had it coming? 
 - No.

168
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,110
Does he have a woman by chance?

169
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,670
I'm not sure. We don't talk to each other about our private lives.

170
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,990
Why? Did he say that he didn't like you?

171
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,470
No, well, he didn't say that but

172
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,750
I guess it's not to the point of marriage either.

173
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,820
The more I think about it, I'm getting mad.

174
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,280
It's not like I have any negative factors.

175
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,560
- Right?
 - Oh, then,

176
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,050
come to me.

177
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,040
I am the only one who can handle you.

178
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,540
I'm not sure. Would I be able to kiss you?

179
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,670
- Let's try it then.
 - Right now?

180
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,660
   

181
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,330
Isn't it rude to call me the morning after you dumped me?

182
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,500
- Let's try it.
 - Huh?

183
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,910
Dating three times, kissing, and even marriage.

184
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,940
Let's try it.

185
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,410
Hey, Kim Min Kyu. What are you doing right now?

186
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,060
I'm asking you out on a date.

187
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,580
Asking me out on a date?

188
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,540
Oh, so you were just playing hard to get yesterday?

189
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,490
Fine. Let's meet this weekend.

190
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,720
Prepare well. You know that I hate tackiness, right?

191
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,610
Sorry. Let's have a drink next time.

192
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,300
I'm leaving.

193
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:37,730


194
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,310
   

195
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,270
We have tracked down Santa Maria's location.

196
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,280
Where are they?

197
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,780
They are at Chairman Kim Min Kyu's house.

198
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,830
    

199
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,820
   

200
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,090
This sounds like a good business.

201
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,550
Why are we stopping it?

202
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,610
So you slept at the sauna last night?

203
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,270
Excuse me, excuse me.

204
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,740
What? Oh yeah.

205
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,000
How harshly did he work you for you to be like this?

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,750
Like what Mold says, that psycho is a pervert for sure.

207
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,970
No, that's really not true.

208
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,170
He's the kind person who gets misunderstood easily, but he's actually a really genuine person.

209
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,870
The reason why he makes mistakes around people is because he doesn't know any better.

210
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,360
Why are you shielding him so much?

211
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,180
You called him a crazy psycho the other day.

212
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,490
Seeing him yesterday, I noticed

213
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,080
that he's not a pervert or a crazy psycho.

214
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,330
It's just that he lived by himself for too long, so that man can't help but be raw like that.

215
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,670
'That man' returns, huh?

216
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:20,360
Sun Hye, if he finds out that I am not a robot, what do you think will happen?

217
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,190
You said that the test was completed.

218
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,370
You're not going to see him again, so why worry?

219
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,900
- Oh, yeah.
 - Why?

220
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,510
Are you disappointed that you won't be going to his house again?

221
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,200
Why are you disappointed? Because of whom? Mold or...!

222
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,660
My bag! I left my bag with the heart lamps there.

223
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,000
I have to go back to that house.

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,750
Mold said he'll bring it to you.

225
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,260
Oh, yeah.

226
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,210
The petition! I have to check if he has read it.

227
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,620
I have to go back to that house.

228
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,420
You said you left it in a visible place.

229
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,290
Then he'll read it.

230
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,170
But still, I should check.

231
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,810
My final screening depends on that petition.

232
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,840
I'll be quick.

233
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,840
Hello?

234
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,600
What? Final screenings are happening?

235
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,450
 A new team leader for Social Contribution has finished going through the existing projects. 

236
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,140
 There will be an orientation for the final screening. 

237
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,480
 We will contact you again. 

238
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,560
Yes, thank you. Please contact me.

239
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,500
What is it?

240
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,050
What? What? The final screenings are happening?

241
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,840
Yes! The new team manager decided to re-open it or something!

242
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes!

243
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,080
The heart lamp! I need to fix my heart lamps!

244
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,430
I should get some new clothes, right?

245
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,300
Hey, you really don't need to enter that house anymore then.

246
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,120
- What?
 - The part-time job! With this, you're completely done, no?

247
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,360
A hundred-million won! Four insurances!

248
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,700
This robot. Does she know what time it is? Why is she not here yet?

249
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,470
By chance... did they not charge her?

250
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,690
No way.

251
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,590
Why hasn't AG-3 come to work yet?

252
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,450
Because there is no more testing to be done.

253
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,180
It seems like you don't want additional research funds.

254
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,150
We will find a new investor and leave.

255
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,250
You'll leave?

256
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,840
With whose permission?

257
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,800
It's my decision.

258
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,020
Don't you know that AG-3 belongs to KM Financial?

259
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,670
That is why we will find a new investor and pay back the initial research fund.

260
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,070
Let's wrap it up that way.

261
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,130
I can't let you do so. Never!

262
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,010
Then we have no other choice but to reveal the truth.

263
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,190
What truth?

264
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,720
That KM Financial's chairman is a pervert that sexually assaulted a robot?

265
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,060
What?

266
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,830
Pervert? Assaulted?

267
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,090
Who did that?!

268
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,850
You... did that! A kiss on AG-3! A kiss!

269
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,120
Right in the middle, here!

270
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,930
That is-- I had a good reason in that situation--

271
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,830
I don't want to know about the situation nor am I curious.

272
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,410
As soon as Santa Maria finds a new investor, we will leave. End of the conversation.

273
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,290
Wait...

274
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,100
Flubber, a viscoelastic material

275
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,170
that simulta--

276
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,140
- And the robot?
 - There is a small problem, so she's under maintenance.

277
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,630
Then this will be difficult.

278
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,590
That you were branded as a con artist in the United States.

279
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,550
The rumors spread here, too.

280
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,900
I expected as much, but I have to be careful, too.

281
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,360
Okay, that's fine. A company that can't tell what's real from what's fake,

282
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,530
we decline from our end as well.

283
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,840
It doesn't seem like it'll be easy to find an investor.

284
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,580
I'm leaving.

285
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,340
- The next investor-- 
 - Stop. Let's take a break first.

286
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,480
I came to get my bag.

287
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,900
I will inform Ssanip to give it to you.

288
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,740
Don't enter the house no matter what.

289
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,400
Okay.

290
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,670
I'll wait in front.

291
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,940
Why did they tell me not to go in at all?

292
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,030
I got fully dressed up in costume just in case.

293
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,210
- Oh my. 
- What are you doing here?

294
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,110
Your shift started a while ago.

295
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,910
The cart... Ji Ah is there.

296
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,950
Oh no.

297
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,560
A problem occurred, Sunbae.

298
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,000
 How dare they try to take away what is mine. 

299
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,360
 Who do they think I am? 

300
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,420
You. You escaped because you wanted to see me!

301
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,730
Good job. Very good job.

302
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,920
That's right. When your master calls you, you should come to your master whenever and wherever you are.

303
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,080
It was worth going through all the trouble of training you.

304
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,680
But you need a scolding first.

305
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,000
Did I do something wrong?

306
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,850
That you're a robot. That's what's wrong.

307
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,410
Just because I'm a robot, I need a scolding?

308
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,140
Yeah. The reason why you're getting scolded is because you don't have a heart.

309
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,010
Starting today, you have to study me every day.

310
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,670
And you have to input an immense amount of information.

311
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,240
I will put down my roots into that heart of yours that's actually a hard drive.

312
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:23,150
If not, I will be very wronged.

313
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,070
It will use up a lot of the battery's power.

314
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:33,550
How much power do you have left? No. How long can you stay with me?

315
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,980
In battery saving mode, about eight hours at the most.

316
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,790
Really? AG-3, battery saving mode.

317
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm entering battery saving mode.

318
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,560
Please do not ask me to do chores if you can while I'm in battery saving mode.

319
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,630
If you don't work, then should I do it?

320
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,770
Should I turn off the battery saving mode?

321
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,760
Okay. Firstly, don't stand, sit.

322
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,210
AG-3, friend mode.

323
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,930
Why did you call me?

324
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,720
Why are you being modest all of a sudden? Call me like how you usually do. "Why did you call me?" like that.

325
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,970
Why are you picking a fight again?

326
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,860
Someone asked me what our relationship was.

327
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,380
So what do you think I said?

328
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,500
What did you say?

329
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,810
I said that you're an ungrateful one who left your master and followed another man.

330
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:49,290
And even so, you're my first friend I've made in 15 years, and admitting that...

331
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,430
Know that it wasn't easy.

332
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,850
And you, you should really be thankful.

333
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,560
I'm about to spend an obscene amount of money to protect you.

334
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,030
Hong Baek Gyun is trying to tear our relationship apart.

335
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:18,150
But I, no matter what happens, will not lose you.

336
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,620
Firstly, we will attack the team members.

337
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,590
Are you going to beg them for help?

338
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,780
Me? Those words? Not over my dead body.

339
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,310
Don't worry. I will do things my way to protect you.

340
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,100
What is this?

341
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,440
It's compensation. Please share it with your members.

342
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,350
No need to thank me.

343
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,650
We don't accept these kinds of things.

344
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,290
This kind of money...

345
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,020
Leave it.

346
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,950
It's a check!

347
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,360
A check?

348
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,920
This is a contract stating that the additional funding of 50 billion won will be sent by the end of this month.

349
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,410
We will check them all at once.

350
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,800
No need for that.

351
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,760
Please take it back.

352
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,160
As expected, you know  how to negotiate.

353
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,390
- Double? 
- Double.

354
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,550
We don't need it.

355
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,390
Fine then. Just give them all that we prepared.

356
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,010
We don't need it no matter what the price is.

357
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,060
You don't need 50 billion won?

358
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,000
I mean, you're saying that you're going to throw away the opportunity of receiving your research funding of 50 billion won?

359
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,790
You should be happy that Doctor is not here.

360
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,430
You better return the robot you stole before he returns tonight.

361
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,630
Stole? How dare--

362
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,020
Why did you attend this kind of meeting?

363
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,300
- I think a discussion... 
- It feels like we should discuss...

364
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,760
Let's continue discussing.

365
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,960
We are prone to accepting your off--

366
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,230
Wait a sec!

367
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,900
Wait a second.

368
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,170
Listen carefully!

369
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,740
AG-3 is mine. She's mine!

370
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,770
Let go!

371
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:32,350
And also, in terms of your working conditions,

372
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:38,150
Master prepared some special rules for you all. Here you go!

373
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,510
First off, starting now

374
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,540
you are now free from the rule of staying within a 20-meter radius of this building.

375
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,650
Second is that you can now order food whenever you desire.

376
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,470
Last is the main point. All the different areas of this mansion.

377
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,940
   

378
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,020
You have a free pass.

379
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,030
- Nice! 
- We did it!

380
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,380
We refuse.

381
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,100
Aish, really.

382
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,330
How could there be humans like that?

383
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,660
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

384
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,430
What the? It's already four?

385
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,060
What do I do? They will come soon to retrieve you. How can I persuade them?

386
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,060
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Shall I help you?

387
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,950
How?

388
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,190
Why else would there be a saying such as "a full ghost shines better?"

389
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,630
Okay. I got the feeling.

390
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,760
A hotel buffet. Shall I rent it out completely? Or high-end catered food?

391
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,150
First, let's pick a cuisine. Korean, Japanese, Western or Chinese?

392
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,440
That's not right.

393
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:50,050
Okay! Well, if I'm going to treat them, then might as well go big. I'll call a world-class chef.

394
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,320
Is this not it either?

395
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,860
A cruise ship.

396
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,180
They didn't take your money. What makes you think that your money-flaunting will work now?

397
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,410
Flaunting.

398
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,430
- You do it. 
 - Flaunting?

399
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,310
Cook, I mean.

400
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,700
So you're saying that I should cook and serve those humans over there?

401
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,530
You don't want to?

402
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,530
Yeah, I don't want to. That won't ever happen!

403
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,100
How could you say such obnoxious things?

404
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,490
Do you want to lose your precious treasure?

405
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,690
No, that's not it.

406
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,740
You had plates like these? They're so pretty.

407
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,040
My mother liked to invite people over and cook for them.

408
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,830
These are the bowls my mother used.

409
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,840
After fifteen years, I get to use them.

410
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,900
Know that this is a huge honor.

411
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,260
I miscalculated how much sauce to use because I've only ever cooked for one person.

412
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,230
AG-3, search it.

413
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,110
Seafood stew. When increasing the amount from one to four, what should be the ratio between the sauce and the other ingredients?

414
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,740
The amount of sauce you should use is as if you're cooking for three and then add more as needed.

415
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,590
Okay. Go and sit.

416
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,390
I will help you.

417
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,690
Your battery will run out. Sitting is helping me.

418
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,100
Did you cut yourself?

419
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,130
Why are you cooking as if your life depends on it?

420
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,030
Because this cooking

421
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,060
is the only weapon to protect you.

422
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,690


423
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,610
♫  Would you understand me? Would you look at me  ♫

424
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,570
♫  My worrying heart.  ♫

425
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:37,470
♫  Is my lovely heart for you. But you, as if you'll definitely come next to me  ♫

426
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,990
♫  To the point I can't open my eyes due to its shine  ♫

427
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:49,090
♫  As much as I'm getting nervous, I love you.  ♫

428
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:55,740
♫  Today too, I spent it getting to know you  ♫

429
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
   

430
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,570
 Is it because of Jo Ji Ah? Because you want to keep her by your side? 

431
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,390
 If she's found out, then you'll be branded as a con artist again. 

432
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,230
 They look good together. 

433
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,030
 That's true. They look good together. 

434
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,580
 How can I help you? Are you going to let Min Kyu take over your work just like this? 

435
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,060
 She's not a robot. She's a human! 

436
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,200
 Do I look weird? 

437
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,490
 You're really pretty. 

438
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,640
 Kim Min Kyu, have you dreamed about kissing this person? 

439
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,480
 No. Never. 

440
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,990
♫  As much as I'm getting nervous, I love you.  ♫
