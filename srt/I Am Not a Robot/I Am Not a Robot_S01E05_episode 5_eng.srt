2
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,650
Here, I'm going to create a room for myself only.

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,360
Don't open up for anyone. It's only I who can go in,

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,840
since I'm going to train you.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,780
Also.

6
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,230
In here. I'll put myself in here.

7
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,210
From now on, you will look only at me, watch over only me, and follow only me.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,160
Input? What are you going to input into my head?

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,360
The first thing I'll be inputting inside of your head will be

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,880
the hierarchy of this household.

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,310
   

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,650
In this house, there is a hierarchy among all the items that receive my love.

13
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,590
You can say it's a form of a caste system.

14
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,180
The items that are at the top of the ranking system all receive the name "Lovely."

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,020
This back scratcher is the first Lovely.

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,650
And this older model robot vacuum is the second Lovely.

17
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,690
And the newer model robot vacuum that celebrated its birthday not to long ago is the third Lovely.

18
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,730
I will also become your Lovely.

19
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:47,460
So what you're saying is, these robot vacuum cleaners, this back scratcher, and I are all on the same level?

20
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,990
Of course not. They all have seniority over you.

21
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,960
In this house, whatever makes me happy receives points.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,870
So you should also work hard at collecting points

23
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,220
and try your best to get to the Lovely rank like these guys, okay?

24
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,950
 Even in here, I have to collect points? 

25
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,480
Once you do, I'll celebrate your birthday as well.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,120
 You little psychopath! 

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,270
The purchase dates for all of the household items here are their birthdays.

28
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,940
 You freaking psychopath! 

29
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,940
I really need to go.

30
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,860
- Hurry, hurry, hurry. Come out quickly! Are you going to be the only one using the bathroom?!
 - Hurry!

31
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,590
Leave me alone already! Don't touch me! I'm not okay!

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,370
Why is this happening to us all at the same time?

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,210
I think it's because of the curry we ate last night... The curry!

34
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,600
- The curry, the curry... 
 - Hurry up!
 - The curry?

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,900
Come out already!

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,920
No... Ji Ah had two bags.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,570
This place also has sacred areas.

38
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,260
Sacred places that go beyond the ranking system.

39
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,910
Castle made out of cards.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,270
Cabinet. And also this figure display.

41
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,830
 I went through so much crap because of that thing. 

42
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,800
Touching these sacred areas is absolutely prohibited.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,580
Make sure to input that in your head.

44
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,920
Next, input the structure of this house.

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,330
Follow me.

46
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,500
Why does my stomach hurt? I didn't even drink any alcohol last night.

47
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,050
- Hey... 
 - Ssanip, stop it, please!

48
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,580
I need to go.

49
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,190
Hurry up and come out. Hurry, hurry!

50
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,160
If you don't come back out in a jiffy, I'm going to kill you.

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,910
I will try my best but I can't guaran--

52
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,360
guarantee it!

53
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,550
Go and tell her... to endure it even if it means she'll die.

54
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,230
All right.

55
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,340
Man, I don't think this is going to work.

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,070
Doctor, I failed the mission.

57
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,160
Seriously, you damn bastard!

58
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,920
This is the kitchen and...

59
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,640
Where is it?

60
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,320
Okay, there is the bathroom.

61
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,630
Why aren't you following me?

62
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,170
What room is this, Master?

63
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,630
A room that only I can go in. A room that you're not allowed to enter.

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,900
Hurry up and come over.

65
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,830
Yes, Master.

66
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,620
Those are my parents. Make sure to input that in your head.

67
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,300
This...
   

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,140
Necklace...

69
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,370
You're right. My mother really cherished that necklace.

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,000
But some stupid person stole it from me, but it will soon come back to me.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,190
AG-3, make sure to input that in your head.

72
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,360
Your master detests people who deceive others.

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,400
I make sure that whoever deceives me pays for their crime no matter what.

74
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,800
Come out. Hurry, move out of the way.

75
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,000
- Let me use it a bit more. 
- Hey, hey, hey! 
 - Sunbaes, I'm sorry!

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,060
Come on, come on!

77
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,090
I'm so glad that you are a robot

78
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,250
since you won't have a reason to deceive me.

79
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,860
And also,

80
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,290
make sure to input this photo in your head as well.

81
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,940
What should I name the folder of this file?

82
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,740
Master, who is it?

83
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,960
My longtime first love--

84
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,780
Dammit!

85
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,750
The folder of this photo has been named as "Dammit."

86
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,320
What's that sound?!

87
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,980
Master, you farted.

88
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,340
- I did? 
- Yes.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,070
It wasn't me.

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,980
Then could it be me?

91
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,900
Of course, it can't be you.

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,270
So that's why it's you, Master.

93
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,230
Oh, then it is me.

94
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,320
That's strange, I have no memory of doing that though.

95
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,630
It probably isn't just a simple fart due to the funky smell.

96
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,700
Master, I  suggest that you go and change your underwear.

97
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,370
That's weird.

98
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,150
Sorry. You wait there.

99
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,660
Okay.

100
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,920
AG-3! Your master isn't someone who just farts anywhere

101
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,290
like that...

102
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,720
Jo Ji Ah, even if you die, you have to hold it.

103
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,750
That curry. I'll throw the whole box away.

104
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,520
Where did it go?

105
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,820
What is that?

106
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,090
What are you doing here?

107
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,220
I'm cleaning, Master.

108
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,070
 Wow... This washroom is huge. 

109
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,580
 Oh, the smell. 

110
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,670
What are you doing here?

111
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm cleaning, Master.

112
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,890
Did any stranger come in?

113
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,330
No.

114
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,900
Then what about the toilet? Did you flush it?

115
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,860
Yes, Master.

116
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,890
I've never told you to clean here though.

117
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,060
Is Ji Ah okay?

118
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,360
No, she's not okay. She's in the washroom right now.

119
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,920
What?!

120
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,290
By the way, is it okay for your hands to get wet?

121
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,020
You can even do the dishes. You are the world's best robot.

122
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,440
Of course! I am the world's best robot who can even do dishes.

123
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,530
Lies.

124
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,950
Who are you trying to deceive? In my home?

125
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,660
You. Does this look like a detergent to you?

126
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,950
It's written in French here.

127
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,310
You said you can speak 15 languages. Or is it that your sensor is not working?

128
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,670
Can't you tell right away just by its scent?

129
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,020
It's the trend these days to clean with perfume.

130
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,850
Is that so? One that costs a million won? You're going to pour this into the toilet?

131
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,390
 I'm sorry. The soap wouldn't mask the smell. 

132
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,410
This is crazy. Just because I have money...

133
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,170
You.

134
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,110
You're being weird.

135
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,920
What? What is?

136
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,880
The thing dripping on your cheek.

137
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,580
It looks like sweat falling down...

138
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,910
Hey!

139
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,370
Get off.

140
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,690
Hey!

141
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,610
- Serves you right. 
- Serv– What?

142
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,140
C-co-corset! A titanium corset.

143
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,780
- Get off! 
- I'm saying that must hurt.

144
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,620
Right, that must hurt a lot because it's all metal.

145
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:04,030
Good. Now Baton's going to believe that she's a robot no matter what she says.

146
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,130
I'm guessing your body is very sore right now, Master.

147
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,550
I'm getting a massage right now because of you! You made my body ache!

148
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,200
Should I change the mode?

149
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,970
Should I lend you my robot hands?

150
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,320
Aren't I quite useful though?

151
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,240
What were you doing with those useful hands earlier then?

152
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
You shook me off and caught the perfume instead.

153
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,640
That's because it was a million won perfume that you really cherished.

154
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,910
Hey, you. Sit down.

155
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,570
Okay, I'm a human and you?

156
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,080
- A robot. 
 - That's right, a robot.

157
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,390
Externally, you look like a normal person but internally, you're just a hunk of metal.

158
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,800
Your body itself is a weapon to humans.

159
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,240
You shouldn't have forgotten that not even for a minute or a second!

160
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,380
Okay, now let's think about what happened earlier.

161
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,650
"Oh, if I fall over here, my master will get hurt."

162
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,460
"I should adjust and fall slightly to the side."

163
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,220
Isn't it normal to come to such a decision?

164
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,300
In terms of physics, it would have been faster for you to avoid me

165
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,990
than for me to fall at a different angle.

166
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,580
It would have been more reasonable for you to avoid.

167
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,620
 Wow, I'm so good at talking. I'm so smart! 

168
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,810
No, wait. What does physics have to do with this?

169
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,850
I'm talking about your attitude when serving your master!

170
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,320
I don't know what you are trying to say. Can you repeat that again?

171
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,080
Should I just sell her?

172
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,870
What's with this situation?

173
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,350
The dog is trying to save someone.

174
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,160
Right. You are that dog right now.

175
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,820
Just like how that dog is sacrificing for his owner,

176
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,570
it is your duty to save me bravely.

177
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,220
Please input this as your mission.

178
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,160
The reason why that dog is saving his owner is because the owner gave him that much love.

179
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,600
You're supposed to show me your loyalty first.

180
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,320
Try to do at least half as much as what that dog does.

181
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,870
Only if you give me half as much love as that owner gave to the dog.

182
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,250
Wait. You...

183
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,720
- How do you know that is a human? 
 - Because he is a human.

184
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,610
No. I mean, his face looks different.

185
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,060
- Isn't that weird? 
 - No matter how he looks, a human is still a human.

186
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,210
Y-You wait here for a second.

187
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,120
What's wrong with him?

188
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,380
AG-3, save me!

189
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,170
Save me, AG-3. Meow.

190
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,490
Meow, me... ow...

191
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,260
Who am I?

192
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,840
Hey.

193
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,130
You recognized that person as a human so why couldn't you recognize me?

194
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,900
Ah. It's Master.

195
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,870
Ah, it's a cat. Ah, Maste— ca— Mas— c— M—

196
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,560
Master's smiling.

197
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,830
Geez, 20 points.

198
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,840
You might be the first one in this household to earn points by making me laugh.

199
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,760
No matter how I change in my looks,

200
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,280
I hope you can still recognize me.

201
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,450
Then I'll really adore you,

202
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,240
and love you, too.

203
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,780
  What is this feeling? His words make my heart flutter but I feel like I've become a dog.  

204
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,300
If I change to the point that you cannot recognize me like how it happened just now,

205
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,050
go to that room I told you not to go in, and open the drawer.

206
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,310
There's going to be a syringe in the drawer.

207
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,270
Inject it into my skin as an emergency maneuver.

208
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:37,260
Then you'll earn 500 points at once and will be upgraded to a Lovely.

209
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,530
 What does that mean? 

210
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm done. If any more comes out, I won't be alive anymore.

211
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,000
I thought my intestines were falling out.

212
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,110
Okay, dude.

213
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,810
Do you have a beggar inside of your body? How is it telling you to fill it as soon as it emptied out?

214
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,900
We're at a point where we understand each other's dung,

215
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,050
so it'd be nice to respect each other's intestines, too.

216
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,510
Be quiet.

217
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,760
Wow, lobster.

218
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,400
- Isn't that salmon? 
 - Oh, please, don't do this.

219
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,630
I want to be in that refrigerator.

220
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,950
There's nothing to eat.

221
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,800
  This annoying bourgeois.  

222
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,220
- That psy... Sunbae, he's a psycho, right? 
 - Are you kidding me?

223
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,010
Do you want me to order delivery food for you?

224
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,490
I can't eat food that others have made. Who knows if they spat on it?

225
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,030
His mental state is not normal.

226
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,550
That's over my personal limit.

227
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,040
This expires tomorrow. You're out.

228
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,120
- You, too. Out.
-   Is he freaking crazy? Why is he throwing that away?  

229
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,380
Don't throw that away. Don't!

230
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,520
- You too. 
 - I should slap him on both sides of his face with a piece of steak.  

231
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,300
It's about time for fresh Korean beef to come.

232
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,660
What's wrong with this? This can't happen.

233
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,510
Hey!

234
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,760
  
  

235
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,540
He's supposed to shake that pan three times.

236
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,020
- That spice is going to hit hard at the end. 
- He's supposed to do that.

237
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,130
 Wow. The visual is to die for and the smells is to die for. 

238
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,820
 This is a true emperor's spicy rice cake. 

239
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,780
- What do you think about your master? 
 - Looks good...

240
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,280
What?

241
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,450
You look cool.

242
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,350
Just cool? Not super cool?

243
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,520
Input it in your head as super duper cool.

244
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,390
You know, in fact there wasn't a time to show this side of me

245
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,090
but your master is this kind of person.

246
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,440
Yeah, yeah. You're really super duper cool, my master.

247
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,180
Now, I should start eating!

248
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,980
This is not food.

249
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,470
This is a masterpiece.

250
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,860
A masterpiece.

251
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,860
Oh my god, I can't watch this. This makes me distressed.

252
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,770
That must be fake. I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually taste good.

253
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,950
- It's a lobster. 
 - That's true.

254
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,300
Those abalones say it all.

255
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,250
- An octopus? It's only helping out on the side. 
- What a pain.

256
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,360
If that's painful, then us being here... We're trapped in here. It's torturous.

257
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,400
She has a huge desire when it comes to eating.

258
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,240
I would eat it together with you if you were a person.

259
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,900
It hurts me.

260
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,990
  Shut up. Are you as pained as I am?  

261
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,610
 I have to complete the mission fast so that I don't see this again. 

262
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,340
For you, Master, I will make the best eating environment.

263
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,800
Please turn on classical music. Please show him a nice beach view.

264
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,120
Wow.

265
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,840
Good job. She's done well as I've instructed.

266
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,980
Finally, you're doing a great job as a robot.

267
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,850
Advertisement of KM Financial's support for young entrepreneurs!

268
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,170
What... is that?

269
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,260
- What is this? 
 - In the video relevant to KM Financial group, there's an advertisement for young entrepreneurs.

270
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,950
There will be someone winning 100 million won soon!

271
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:03,100
You're even contributing to society. Master, you're really super duper cool!

272
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,600
No one's winning. Forever. So turn it off.

273
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
It's something that you have been working on.

274
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,050
It's also a promise to contribute to society.

275
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,860
You should put much effort in keeping that promise for the reputation of the company.

276
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,080
Your master doesn't do any of those trivial works.

277
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,490
  Someone has bet her life on that "trivial" work.  

278
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,220
Those swindlers...

279
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,300
  S-S-Swindlers?!  

280
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,380
How dare do they do this? Do they know what kind of a person I am?

281
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,240
  What do you mean what kind of person? You're a huge bas— 

282
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:39,430
Then what kind of person would my master be, if he doesn't do any of those "trivial" things?

283
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,240
Why are you asking this when I'm eating?

284
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,880
I should know you more so that I can sedu—

285
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,990
No, I mean serve you better.

286
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,390
 But if the registered counterpart is just one person, 

287
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,570
 then her approximation rate will increase greatly and she can have a complex emotional dialogue with you. 

288
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,170
Oh, there was a deep meaning behind that.

289
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,790
Okay, fine!

290
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,330
Use this opportunity to properly input information about me

291
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,420
and have great respect for me. That's not bad.

292
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,030
When talking about me, your master...

293
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,200
Firstly, I'm rich.

294
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,370
I have so much money. Like you could just brag about it.

295
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,140
Is that who you are?

296
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:34,120
No. No, that's... not me. Not that.

297
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,060
I'm the boss who controls KM Financial Group. Yes, I'm the boss.

298
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,720
Is that who you are?

299
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:50,430
Th-That's... also not... not me.

300
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,220
Then what kind of person are you?

301
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,560
Listen carefully, AG-3. When talking about your master...

302
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,850
so... when talking about your master,

303
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,890
so when I'm talking about myself...

304
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,440
Wait.

305
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,430
I don't think it's your time to leisurely have a conversation with me.

306
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,960
Can't you see that your sunbae is working hard alone?!

307
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,050
Look.

308
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,580
Hurry and go clean. Help your sunbae! Quickly! Go!

309
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,480
How dare you— Go already!

310
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,790
Okay, my master.

311
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,550
It has already gotten cold because it was asking me useless stuff.

312
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,750
He doesn't even know himself yet he's criticizing?

313
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,220
Do you want me to tell you?

314
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,790
 I won't give a cent of my money to a con-artist like you. 

315
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,900
You're a cheap bastard who took my precious 300,000 won.

316
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,990
 Happy birthday, my beautiful one. 

317
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,510
And you're a psychopath who celebrates a robot vacuum's birthday.

318
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,870
And you have the worst personality like no other in this world.

319
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,750
Wow.

320
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,200
Hey!!!

321
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,420
Say that you ran out of battery. Hey, you guys, hurry and take her out!

322
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,950
There's only 5% of battery left so I am going into standby mode.

323
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,860
Call me after I'm charged.

324
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,700
I feel like I let an insane dog inside my home.

325
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,390
By chance, did you characterize AG-3 after a beagle?

326
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,050
She has a personality resembling a beagle.

327
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,130
I feel like she's doing what I tell her to do, but—

328
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,390
She eventually does it the way she wants to do it.

329
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,740
Then it leads to the worst possible situation.

330
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,650
She's the best at it in this world.

331
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,840
What is this... awkward agreement?

332
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,620
I'm not talking about someone else's robot right now!

333
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,250
I feel so frustrated.

334
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,030
Do you think you're more frustrated than me?

335
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,470
The AG-3 that I nurtured was an innocent and lovely sheep. What happened?

336
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,890
So do you mean that I'm the problem?

337
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,150
What fault would you have?

338
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,090
That unpredictable beagle is the problem.

339
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,310
This just doesn't make sense. In someone's house, there's Korean beef rotting around.

340
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,500
This dirty and unfair society.

341
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,510
Sorry for the poor circumstances.

342
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,510
Should we eat Korean beef?

343
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,550
And sometimes, she just doesn't understand what I'm saying.

344
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:59,420
In my opinion, I think there's a problem in the problem-solving circuit.

345
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,280
Ho-How does she not understand what you're saying?

346
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,330
AG-3, I mean.

347
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,800
Between saving the perfume and its master, that robot chose to save the perfume!

348
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,610
I told her she's not supposed to do that.

349
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,160
- And I told her to save the master, but then she brought up physics.
 - Oh my.

350
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,630
I even taught her the emergency manual, yet she doesn't understand it at all.

351
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,280
Aigoo.

352
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,610
- Hurry, hurry. 
- Okay.

353
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,620
If he brought guests into his home, shouldn't he check if they've eaten or not?

354
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,560
He thinks his mouth is the only mouth.

355
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,620
You said that AG-3 is a robot that can relate emotionally.

356
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,900
I can't seem to relate at all. When will I be able to?

357
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,620
Was it even possible to communicate with her in the first place?

358
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,390
No matter how I think about this,

359
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,230
regarding the contract of AG-3, we should reconsi—

360
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,620
I'm talking so what are you staring—

361
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:05,420
So... So that training is to build a relationship.

362
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,750
Yes. A relationship.

363
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,830
Relationship? But you said it was about input.

364
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,450
The problem is the content being input.

365
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,350
If information is the only thing being input,

366
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,440
a relationship with AG-3 will only be something like a smart secretary and an employer.

367
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,030
However, if emotions are input at the same time with information,

368
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:32,930
it's possible to develop a relationship with AG-3 to the extent where emotions can also be communicated.

369
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,530
So input my... emotions?

370
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,170
Wow, amazing.

371
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,960
This is really innovative. It's my idea.

372
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,900
And I'm the one who made it.

373
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,860
Won't you seriously have a business meeting about this product with me later?

374
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,850
Doctor, can you stop glaring at me?

375
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,970
It was going to be thrown away anyway, so we're just throwing it away into our stomachs.

376
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,070
It's also better for the Earth.

377
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,970
Is this beer also for this Earth?

378
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,060
Meat goes with alcohol. That's a providence of nature.

379
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,720
Here, I'll do it.

380
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,520
Okay, the boss will be in charge of cooking. So here, here. Let's drink up.

381
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,250
Cheers!

382
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,300
But I was curious from before... Who came up with that old-fashioned pink uniform?

383
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,480
You should've picked a pretty one while you were at it. I don't think you'll be able to find something like that even if you tried.

384
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,500
Are you asking me because you really don't remember?

385
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,080
 Auntie, one serving of pork skin please! 

386
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,580
 Yes, I'm coming. 

387
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,650
 A bottle of soju, please. 

388
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,540
 Yes, yes. 

389
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,150
 This is so yummy. 

390
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,400
 I didn't order this. 

391
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,680
 Someone ordered it for you. I guess you were eating pleasantly. 

392
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,990
 - Really? Awesome!
 - Yes. 

393
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,330
What?

394
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,150
Just eat.

395
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,910
Eat one piece of meat at a time. Are you the only one with a mouth? There are this many people.

396
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,800
Yes, well, what's this atmosphere?

397
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,300
Perhaps, it seems like an ex-boyfriend and ex-girlfriend are recovering their relationship.

398
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,930
Yeah, it can be considered that way.

399
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,670
Well, if you live and eat in the same house, love can spark again!

400
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,870
Are you filming a horror movie? That's terrible.

401
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,590
What? Horror?!

402
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,620
Terrible?!

403
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,260
Do I hunt you down and eat you? What's so terrible?

404
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,150
We are each other's dark history that we want to erase.

405
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,490
   

406
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,520
This doesn't seem like someone else's problem.

407
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,630
To solve the problem, input emotions and build a relationship.

408
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,330
Relationship.

409
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,830
"A relationship is planting your roots in someone's heart."

410
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,420
Planting your roots in someone's heart.

411
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,090
But she doesn't have a heart.

412
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,500
