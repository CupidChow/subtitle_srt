1
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,750
You really are... a robot.

2
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,670
E...T?

3
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,630
What is he doing?

4
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,220
She looks exactly like a human, but nothing happened.

5
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,310
Because she's a robot?

6
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,260
I am powered by a battery placed in my chest.

7
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,530
After being fully charged, I operate for 3 hours,

8
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,160
and my joints are structured similarly to those of a human.

9
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,000
Each of my arms can bear 30kg of weight.

10
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,950
Using an NFC sensor, I can detect various smells, too.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,710
Using my touch sensor, I can recognize various objects.

12
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,950
I have 20 business-related functions as well, including stocks, accounting, and languages skills.

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,520
Please use me fully.

14
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,540
   

15
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,350
No additional funding was granted, so I couldn't pay the electricity bill.

16
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,050
We draw electricity from the factory next door, but it went bankrupt today.

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,290
I've heard that you're a con-artist in the science industry.

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,780
I've heard that you're a bully in the finance industry.

19
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,760
Do I need to know anything else?

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,570
- Our Santa Maria team is-- 
- I mean about AG-3.

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,460
Of course. AG-3?

22
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,410
How do I feel right now?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
   

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,860
You are angry.

25
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,470
I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong, Doctor?

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,330
No, I am not angry.

27
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,910
I am happy that you are not angry, Doctor.

28
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,560
This is AG-3's main skill.

29
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,990
Through deep learning, a core technology of AI,

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,910
AG-3 is able to

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,800
read facial expressions and share emotions.

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,060
I guarantee that in the near future,

33
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,180
we will be living in an era of domesticated robots.

34
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,090
Domesticated.

35
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,840
The same way we train dogs, something like that?

36
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,910
Chairman, should I make you laugh?

37
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,720
What?

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,360
What kind of cow is a cow that you just cannot understand?

39
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,750
I don't know. 
 ('Mo-reu-get-so', which means 'I don't know' 
A pun, 'so' is the Korean word for cow) 

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,570
You just laughed. You must get my humor.

41
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,440
Is this the main skill

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,280
that you talked about, Doctor?

43
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,300
A person must go through a month of deep learning sessions with AG-3

44
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,300
in order for her to collect data about that person and to relate emotionally on a complex--

45
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,940
Tomorrow, for one day,

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,410
I will check the veracity of AG-3's claimed skills.

47
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,700
The discussion about additional funding will come after that.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,440
For the sake of the test, tomorrow

49
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,160
send AG-3 to my house.

50
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, take a seat.

51
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,980
- The contract preparations were done well, right? 
 - Yes.

52
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,410
This is really the last time.

53
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,320
Let us get a home run coolly in one go.

54
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,910
 - Yes, Chairman? 
 - I'm on my way to the meeting right now.

55
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,620
- Straighten things out. 
- Pardon? Hello?

56
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,030
Security team leader? The chairman is coming to work right now.

57
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,740
Right now? I understand.

58
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,360
- Code red! 
 - Code red!

59
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,790
Quickly! Quickly! Get out! Get out!

60
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,360
Hey! Move it!

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
 Code red. The chairman is coming to work. 

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,950
 The chairman is coming to work. 

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,980
That employee just now. Give him a pay cut.

64
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,190
Please continue. Don't end it.

65
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,670
In two days, the contract signing with Bold Group from the United Kingdom

66
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,870
for the sale of the R&amp;D team

67
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,020
will occur as planned in the main conference room at headquarters.

68
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,850
This sale will conclude

69
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,890
the sell-off of various divisions of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

70
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,170
You all worked hard.

71
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,080
- Yes, Chairman?
 - I'm asking because I don't know, but

72
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,550
what did Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&amp;D team research?

73
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,810
They research technologies used in ships, I believe.

74
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,960
 You are invited to the demonstration 

75
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,350
 of android robot, AG-3, 

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,510
 that will shock the world. 

77
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,520
I see. I'm asking because I really don't know.

78
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,370
The Santa Maria team.

79
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,220
What is the result of their research?

80
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,990
I believe they have not been able to conclude anything yet.

81
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,780
Those words,

82
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,710
- you will have to take responsibility for them. 
- Pardon?

83
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,180
You're tolerating it well. You must be pretty tough.

84
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,700
- Sorry? Who are...
- You don't know who I am?

85
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
Social contribution team leader.

86
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,440
I am the brain of this company for 20 years now.

87
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,810
Sorry, it's only been a month since I started working.

88
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,590
The investigation team is under Baton-- I mean

89
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,430
Chairman Kim, so it must be hard.

90
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,430
Most of them couldn't last a month.

91
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,920
Team Leader Jo, you're probably the 25th one or so.

92
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,510
25th...

93
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,970
If you want to cross over, tell me whenever. I'll become your bridge.

94
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,600
- Cross what? 
- You don't know? Our company has two prominent leaders.

95
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,990
CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol's followers and Baton's followers.

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,840
Why? Because CEO and Baton are friends yet rivals.

97
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,570
Why are you doing something out of character?

98
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,170
Doing something out of character is my specialty. You know that.

99
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,620
I'm in charge of the Daeyang Shipbuilding sell-off.

100
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,270
- If you're like this, then there will be a problem in the hierarchy. 
- You

101
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,160
are the company's CEO. Me?

102
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,650
I'm the Chairman of the Board Directors.

103
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm the one who is keeping this company alive.

104
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,030
I've earned 70% of KM Financial's profit.

105
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,480
Where is the issue in terms of hierarchy?

106
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,010
Okay, well...

107
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,880
- If you have something to say--
 - I don't have anything to say right now.

108
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,900
Later, maybe. I don't know yet.

109
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,690
Until then, keep doing what you do.

110
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,640
Whatever that is. I will get going now.

111
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,950
   

112
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,260
Oh! It's done! It's done! Huh?

113
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,880
But why is no light coming from this one?

114
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,420
Ta-dah! It's on.

115
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,820
Gosh, that's not how it's supposed to work.

116
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,750
How many times do I have to tell you? How frustrating.

117
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,210
If you're frustrated, then you make it yourself, CEO Jo!

118
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,430
No, you're the genius.

119
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,860
- Take a look. 
 - Look at what?

120
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,510
Look. Here, this bulb. If I touch it with my hands,

121
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,820
then sensing it, the other light should turn on.

122
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,870
Whether you're in Korea or in Africa,

123
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,260
if it's connected to Wi-Fi, then one light will turn the other light on. That's the key!

124
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,500
But this. Is it actually going to be created as a product?

125
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,650
A competition that is infamous for being hard. Me.

126
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,980
This CEO Jo has made it to the final rounds.

127
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,030
If I pass the next round with this prototype and get first place next week, then ₩100,000,000.

128
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,150
I will receive ₩100,000,000 in my bank account.

129
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,320
Say goodbye to part-time jobs. Come back, CEO Jo.

130
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,890
Cheers.

131
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,480
I mean, I knew the company was not doing well and that we wouldn't be receiving research funds.

132
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,570
But who knew a company this big would go under and be sold to another company?

133
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,320
Electricity cut out so we drew power from somewhere else

134
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,660
and we weren't able to pay rent for months, so it was really bleak.

135
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,660
Gosh, I guess there's really no reason to die.

136
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,580
They're a really rich company, so 50 billion won?

137
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,500
They'll probably just confirm and send it over.

138
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,340
Once additional research funds come in,

139
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,470
let's move first.

140
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,860
The batteries need to be replaced as well.

141
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,550
Sensors and a lot of other parts need to be changed as well.

142
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,510
Replace them all. Wash your face in a new sink and the new robot will be

143
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,270
at the new laboratory.

144
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,370
I brought you some beer.

145
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,580
Thank you.

146
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,940
AG-3, what kind of dog comes when you eat meat?

147
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,200
Toothpick!
 ('Ee-soo-shi-gae', which means 'toothpick' 
A pun, 'gae' is the Korean word for dog) 

148
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,330
Geesh.

149
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,150
Stop teaching her weird things.

150
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,740
This is why she is becoming stranger by the minute.

151
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,630
But there is nobody else here that makes AG-3 laugh as much I do.

152
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,780
You want to bet? Let's bet 10,000 won on this. Everyone in?

153
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,080
- Deal. 
 - Me too.

154
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,300
AG-3, I will gift you with a C cup breast once we get the extra grant money for new developments.

155
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,020
I don't really understand what you are saying.

156
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,760
AG-3, what happens when your cheekbones ascend towards heaven?

157
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,150
Cheekbones cannot ascend towards heaven. It's not a dragon, you know.

158
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,310
Wrong!

159
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,170
AG-3, S-M-I-L-E.

160
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,110
- Smile. 
 - Bingo.

161
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,660
- Unbelievable. 
- Seriously?

162
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,980
- Even I can do that. 
 - There weren't any rules.

163
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,790
10,000 won.

164
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,730
So AG-3's

165
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,170
and Baton's memory will be stored in there, right?

166
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,800
Hey, get lost. Can't you see that her chest is open?

167
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,970
Don't you know that even one drop of water in there will cause a short and screw everything up?

168
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,090
Hey...

169
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,740
Please throw this away for me.

170
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,850
Thank you.

171
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,770
I'm here.

172
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,500
Why are you standing there like that?

173
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,400
Auntie, Dad's here.

174
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,320
I got caught by your brother. Sorry about that.

175
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,750
Oppa, please listen to me.

176
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,620
You come here, little girl.

177
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,830
- Oppa! Oppa! 
- You come over here right now.

178
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,490
Didn't I tell you that I was going to kick you out of the house if you talked about starting a business one more time?!

179
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,300
Did I tell you to go get a job no matter what or not?!

180
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,640
Oppa, I was going to get a job, you know. But it's impossible, so what can I do?

181
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,680
If you can't, you should build up your resume and find another way! You're addicted to starting businesses.

182
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,320
And now you have the gall to use your sister-in-law's money? Ten million won at that!

183
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,710
What did you do with that money? What kind of garbage did you come up with this time, huh?!

184
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,690
Oppa, I'm sorry. Stop running around. You have weak lungs.

185
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,760
When are you going to snap out of it?

186
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,320
All right, I understand. I get it, so let's eat first then continue talking.

187
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,900
Today's your birthday. I bought your favorite cake.

188
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,250
Who  asked you to buy such a thing?

189
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,550
Can't you just...

190
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,760
Can't you just cheer me on?

191
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,410
You got all the support when Dad was around and studied as much as you wanted to.

192
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,880
You went to Seoul University, became a lawyer, got married, had Dong Hyeon, and accomplished all!

193
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,210
So what if I went to Seoul University? So what if I'm a lawyer? Do you think that my life is easy now?

194
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,380
Of course, it is. So please cut me some slack here.

195
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,750
You're the only one who can support me since Dad has passed away.

196
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,450
I heard enough. Quit everything that you're doing right now.

197
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,500
I won't tell you to pitch in with the bills, so go take a class or find a way to get a job instead of sleeping all day long!

198
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,100
Don't try to look for an  easy way out either.

199
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,020
Does this look easy to you? This is just as hard as looking for work, okay?!

200
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,980
Why do you think I sleep all day long? I stayed up all night yesterday and the night before, too!

201
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,340
I wanted to pay you back because I feel so bad!

202
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,890
Then pay me back. Pay the loan off at the bank tomorrow right away!

203
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,280
Fine, I will pay you back!

204
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,550
 I'm from the South Korean Santa Maria Research Center-- 

205
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,920
Hello, I was wondering...

206
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,020
Hoktal.

207
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,860
Have you got a confirmation yet?

208
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,020
Negative. I'm so sorry. I guess I should just go die now.

209
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,560
If you have time to talk, make another phone call.

210
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,450
Ssanip, what about in North America?

211
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,550
Negative.

212
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,590
 Thank you very much. 

213
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,560
I found it. There was one left.

214
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,590
But it's coming from overseas, so it won't arrive till the day after tomorrow.

215
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,160
I don't know if Baton will let us postpone for two days.

216
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,780
We should still try. Pi, make the phone call.

217
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,670
Me?

218
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,350
Wouldn't it be better for a woman to ask for a favor?

219
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,350
Do I look like a woman to you?

220
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,190
I'll just do it.

221
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,910
What's going on?

222
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,210
Hello, Chairman, I was wondering if you could postpone AG-3 testing for two days.

223
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,380
Oh, I forgot to tell you earlier.

224
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:08,480
Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&amp;D team, including Santa Maria, will be sold in two days to Bold Group in the United Kingdom.

225
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,230
Tomorrow is the only opportunity you have for the experiment.

226
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,520
   

227
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,390
   

228
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,390
Patent hunter?

229
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,960
This guy will break AG-3 into pieces and sell it for profit.

230
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,660
I will pay you back. I will even go into a bigger debt to pay you back.

231
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,230
♫  Don't frown  ♫

232
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,000
Who is it?

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,850
♫  Everyone is going through hard times  ♫

234
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,220
Not interested in getting a loan.

235
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,780
♫  Don't frown. Everyone is going through hard times  ♫

236
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,250
I have bad credit, do you understand?! I'm not interested in getting a loan!

237
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,090
If you have so much money to give away, just give ten million won, why don't you!?

238
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,720
Long time no talk.

239
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,770
Who are you?

240
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,550
It's me. Did you forget my voice already?

241
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,680
It's because I have a bad memory. Who are you?

242
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,150
Were we close that you're speaking informally?

243
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,290
This is Hong Baek Gyun.

244
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,230
Red flag, blue flag?

245
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,740
Are you really going to pretend like you don't know me? It's me, Mold.

246
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,350
Bleach is perfect for molds.

247
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,070
I will give you the ten million won. Where are you right now?

248
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,210
What kind of name is Mold for crying out loud?

249
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,400
Then your last name is Gom and your given name is Pangyi?

250
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,840
Could it be him... Mold?

251
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,870
You stupid idiot. How could you forget such a thing?

252
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,200
I can't see him when I'm like this. Not over my dead body.

253
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,720
Long time no see.

254
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,990
Y... Y-Your hair. This hair. W-Why did you cut it?

255
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,770
No, I mean when did you cut it? Why did you chop off your hair as you desired?! Why?

256
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,110
Your chest. How much padding did you stuff inside your bra?!

257
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,320
All right, you could put on a wig and we can just take the padding out of your bra.

258
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,950
That's right!

259
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:33,680
Normally, people ask how someone is doing first, especially if they haven't seen each other in a long time.

260
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,870
That's true. But it's obvious that you haven't been doing so well though.

261
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,810
So, I'm rather happy about that.

262
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,950
You have more wrinkles now, Sweetie. So that makes me happy as well.

263
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,510
Sweetie?

264
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,670
How am I still your... Sweetie?

265
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,720
You still haven't changed your habit of not listening.

266
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,920
Professor, we broke up and we are now strangers. So listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

267
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,830
Normally when people hear stuff like this

268
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:11,450
they will focus on the "more wrinkles" part, but Sw-- but you,

269
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,690
you focus on the word "sweetie."

270
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,830
The way your brain is wired, you only hear the phrases and the words you want to hear. Am I right?

271
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,790
You need to work on that.  That is...

272
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,060
really bad.

273
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,320
It's because I'm a genius.

274
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,680
So why are you here, Doctor Genius?

275
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,510
- I'm here to give you a chance to pay off your debt. 
 - Debt?

276
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,560
You felt sorry for a while now, right? I will give you an opportunity to pay off your debt tonight.

277
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,500
Here, ten million won. I will give you this money but do a part-time job for me. Just one day, tomorrow. For three hours.

278
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,960
Ten—

279
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,660
Am I going be sold for my internal organs?

280
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,860
This is a part-time job that only you can perform. So that's why I'm giving you this money.

281
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,360
Just for one day, for three hours.

282
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,630
Just what kind of part-time job is it?

283
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,840
The active sound should be inserted here.

284
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,210
Hold on a moment. And...

285
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,330
Decision..

286
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,820
Mama Mia!

287
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,560
Wow.

288
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,800
Is our AG awake now? Could it be that you fixed it?

289
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,290
How in the world did you fix it when the parts haven't even arrived yet?

290
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,920
Our team is truly awesome. Seriously.

291
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,390
But your wig has changed. How come your breasts got bigger?

292
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,830
I wonder if the battery swelled up or something. Don't worry.

293
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,270
Oppa will fix it for you.

294
00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:03,500
Wait. Say hi. This is AG-3's model. Jo Ji Ah.

295
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,480
Model? Then, human? Oh my.

296
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,750
Pardon me, but how do you two know each other?

297
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,490
Oh. A while ago, we briefly... knew each other.

298
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,580
Wait. Wait. Model? What are you talking about?

299
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,780
Why am I there?

300
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,310
Hey, is your ex-boyfriend crazy?

301
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,370
A scientist who made a robot with his ex-girlfriend's face.

302
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,410
But how much does it resemble you? Does it really look human?

303
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,490
Like in sci-fi movies?

304
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,750
- Is this fun for you? 
- I'm worried.

305
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,040
Even in break ups, "rule of total shit" still applies.

306
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,350
The shit you never got to let out when you were breaking up could erupt and come out at any given time.

307
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,870
The way I see it, he's being shitty right now.

308
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,920
- What shitty talk is this?
 - I mean, he still has lingering feelings for you.

309
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,310
Are you saying that to make me excited or scared?

310
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,630
Which is it though?

311
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,140
- Should we toss a coin? 
- This won't do.

312
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,130
The way I see it, it's not over for you either.

313
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,700
Date your ex-boyfriend again. Take on that job. I think it will give you closure.

314
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,590
I won't take the job. I won't date him.

315
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,420
It's one thing if I get kicked out of my house, but no way am I doing that crazy job!

316
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,660
 You're not her friend but her sister-in-law. You even took a loan out for her? Are you nuts? 

317
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,880
 It's because you're like this that she can't get her act together. 

318
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,370
 I got it. I got it, so at least let her sleep at home. Okay? 

319
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:54,320
 Come in where? Tell her not to even think about coming home until the ₩10,000,000 loan is paid off. 

320
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,240
My back. Sheesh.

321
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,150
I should just file a claim on him for a hospital fee.

322
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,020
That super jerk! That dine-and-dash jerk!

323
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,530
My necklace.

324
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,500
Ten million won.

325
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,760
I thought about it again and I thought it was all right to take that in exchange for copying my face.

326
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,150
I'll do the part-time job for you as an unpaid volunteer.

327
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,020
That's a shameless calculation that doesn't add up,

328
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,130
but the end cost is the same, so I'll take it.

329
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,730
I hope you don't misunderstand my willingness as having lingering feelings for you or something.

330
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,910
And I hope you also don't misunderstand thinking I'm doing this out of some personal desire.

331
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,850
What do I do now?

332
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,660
Where did it go? Seriously? Necklace.

333
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,670
This is making me nuts.

334
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,610
 Hey, give me my money! 

335
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,980
 Pay up, you jerk! 

336
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,570
 Give it! 

337
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,540
Crazy CEO Jo!

338
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,590
The previous generation of robots walk a bit clumsily.

339
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,390
They move like that. Quiet, you.

340
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,880
Look now. But these days, with cutting-edge technology,

341
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,970
like a human being. With ease.

342
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,490
Like flowing water, like a real human being, smoothly.

343
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,770
Smoothly. If they want to look to the side, they turn their head first.

344
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,810
Then they turn their body. Smoothly, smoothly. Do you understand?

345
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,470
Yes, it's easy, right? Smoothly. Stay still.

346
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,530
Are you doing a mask dance?

347
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,750
-  Smoothly. 
- You did it like that a moment ago. 
- I did?!

348
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,000
I did? You did, Doctor. 
   

349
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,720
Robots in the past, they would be like this.

350
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,780
They put it down, then very carelessly, they let go.

351
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,400
But our AG-3 will move very carefully.

352
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,360
Slowly in a continuous movement, and at last, without a sound.

353
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,320
Ji Ah, please try it.

354
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,620
There's a sound!

355
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,340
- Like that. 
- This part should go here.

356
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,320
What... That's all?

357
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,130
Here I thought it was something totally amazing since you said robots.

358
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,370
Those are wearable display lens with the smallest camera built in.

359
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,710
And this is a wireless transmitter.

360
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,390
You can wear it on your wrist. Hoktal,  connect to the network.

361
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,910
Check.

362
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,920
Done.

363
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,780
- Wow. 
- We connected Jo Ji Ah and AG-3.

364
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,560
To say it easily, you're AG-3's avatar.

365
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,280
Everything you see and hear, AG-3 hears and sees, too.

366
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,630
She will tell you how to act using subtitles or videos through the lens.

367
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,790
You just need to read it.

368
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,130
Hi, Aji-3.

369
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,680
I love you, Master. What would you like?

370
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,200
 I love you, Master. What would you like? 

371
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,370
I lo--

372
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,400
You're telling me to read that right now?

373
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,100
No way you made that lump of metal with my face say that she loves you every day!

374
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,410
Do you have some lingering feelings for me by chance?

375
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,230
Lingering feelings?

376
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,590
Who?

377
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,370
I told you not to delude yourself, right?

378
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,040
AG-3 is different from you.

379
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,900
She has everything you don't have and is a perfect being.

380
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,620
She's an extraordinary and superior being.

381
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,680
She's more perfect, more extraordinary, and superior to me?

382
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,290
In what way? She's just a robot. How is she any different than a doll?

383
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,220
AG-3, analyze Europe's current stock market.

384
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,750
Wow.

385
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:44,550
AG-3, read the most recent article published in the field of science. The original text.

386
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,800
Wow, awesome!

387
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,780
I feel like I became a genius!

388
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,380
Your IQ is 94. AG-3 is the genius since she has immeasurable IQ.

389
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,510
But how am I supposed to read this? I can't speak English.

390
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,290
What is this? What should I do?

391
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,040
Sunbae, get out of the car and look for a doorbell.

392
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,470
- No, I—
- It's opening! It's opening!

393
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,390
Wow, this...

394
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,600
We're here.

395
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,090
   

396
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,150
Hey, Annoying Jerk. What is it?

397
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,180
You finally picked up your phone.

398
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,460
That's my choice.

399
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,560
Did you finally give into your guilt and pay up? I'll gladly accept it.

400
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,530
My necklace. You took it, didn't you?

401
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,450
What? Why are you trying to blame me for something you lost?

402
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,260
You ripped my necklace off of my neck that day!

403
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,630
- Don't you remember?
 - Geez, this is ridiculous.

404
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,890
You better give me back my necklace before I really sue you.

405
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,790
Hey, are you mentally ill?

406
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,460
 I'm being serious right now. Go to a hospital. 

407
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,040
- Wha--
 - Nowadays, going to a psychiatrist is not weird.

408
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,630
 Try to go, huh? 

409
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,450
What does he take me for?

410
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,680
He left 156 missed calls and 45 text messages.

411
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,960
-  We're going in. 
 - They're going in now.

412
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,060
Wow, what a nice house.

413
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,480
Wow, it really feels like LA here. I have a friend named Jane who lives in LA. I remember her.

414
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,860
- Is this really a house?
- Her red hair was really pretty.

415
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,620
Wow, this house really feels like LA. Reminds me of Jane in LA.

416
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,570
Turn off your phone. We're at an important place.

417
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,490
- Ji Ah, turn off your cell phone.
- She... took her cell phone

418
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,240
- with her?
 - Is she crazy?

419
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,160
- Ji Ah... please turn off your cell phone.
 - Turn it off already!

420
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,690
If you call me one more time, I'll report you to the police.

421
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,210
- That's my line! If you don't return my necklace...
 - AG.

422
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,270
I will chase you till--

423
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,580
Gosh, that crazy woman!

424
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,450
That crazy jerk!

425
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,020
Ta-da. Wow.

426
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,810
A glass of water would be nice.
