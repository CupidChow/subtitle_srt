1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,760
If only she were a robot like you,

2
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,960
I could touch her hair like this.

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,620
Hold her hand.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,570
Go together to places where there's a lot of people. And...

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,880
I could also kiss her. I pray.

6
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,010
♫  Loving with the whole heart   ♫

7
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,210
Touching you, I see the answer.

8
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,970
♫  Could I   ♫

9
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,130
I'm going to gift this necklace

10
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,850
to the last woman of my life.

11
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:06,010
 She remembered whenever it was my parents' death anniversary. 

12
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,670
 On a day when I couldn't receive blessings from anyone, 

13
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,770
 she gave me a small happiness. 

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,430
 In my life, will there be someone like that again? 

15
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,360
 Thank you. 

16
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,230
 This is 

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,650
 enough for me. 

18
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,710
   

19
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,320
The weather is nice.

20
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,470
How can there be a downpour when it's as clear as this?

21
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,070
   

22
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:24,550
This is your last chance. If this doesn't work, then Jo Ji Ah, you will give up.

23
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,200
But what does this guy think I am?

24
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,990
He thinks I'm a robot. Even still,

25
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,320
my looks are just like a woman.

26
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,310
But a robot is just a robot.

27
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,290
 Yes, I made the reservation. 

28
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,650
No, I mean the entire hall.

29
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,130
No, I want you to empty it out completely without a single person remaining.

30
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,170
I don't need them! The server?

31
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,360
AG-3. Look at the sky.

32
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,910
The clouds are excited.

33
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,900
Isn't this the perfect day for a proposal?

34
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,960
Are you planning to propose today?

35
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,990
They said a downpour will happen later.

36
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,850
If that happens, then great.

37
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,710
Doctor, you need to come over for a second.

38
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,560
 I could also kiss her. 

39
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,060
This perverted, crazy psycho!

40
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,470
It seemed like you should make the decision.

41
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,740
I knew this would happen! Bring Jo Ji Ah out quickly!

42
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,240
She's not home right now.

43
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,410
Then just where is she?

44
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,850
   
  

45
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,240
Hot cocoa is for kids.

46
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,090
She loves hot cocoa.

47
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,060
One and a half cups of water and four spoons of cocoa.

48
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,080
Isn't that mug a bit weird to use when you're about to propose?

49
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,750
This mug has a story.

50
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,040
She gave it to me as a birthday present.

51
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,390
When was that?

52
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,140
About... 15 years ago?

53
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,680
And you still have it?

54
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,740
To me, she's a very special person.

55
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,320
When Ri El comes later, serve as I've told you.

56
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,320
Yes, Master.

57
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,960
She's here.

58
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,470
Don't make any mistakes.

59
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,860
She looks extra pretty today.

60
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,230
Did he take her out again? That crazy man.

61
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,710
- Track AG-3's location.
 - She is inside.

62
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,270
He means Jo Ji Ah's location.

63
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,740
I can't stand this perverted psycho anymore. Don't you dare touch AG-3.

64
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,550
What's up with the hot cocoa?

65
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,220
- You like it. 
- I used to a long time ago.

66
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,420
Now, just looking at it, it's too sweet.

67
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,900
Gosh, I told him that hot cocoa wasn't the right choice.

68
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,450
Oh, I see. You don't like it now.

69
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,160
What's with the mug, too?

70
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,580
This mug is very childish, right?

71
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,170
That's the present you gave me.

72
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,800
- Present?
 - Yeah. A birthday present! From a while ago.

73
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,890
Is that right?

74
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,450
Why do you keep just talking about the past? You sound old because of that.

75
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,040
It makes you look old.

76
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,280
Is that so?

77
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,130
Because you prepared it, I will drink it out of manners.

78
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,490
It's super sweet.

79
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,460
She just killed him twice.

80
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,860
So what's the answer you brought?

81
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,290
What else would the answer be? The necklace is the answer.

82
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,920
Two cups of coffee.

83
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,090
Tell me your answer first.

84
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:39,650
Ye Ri El, I'm not going to go on three dates with you.

85
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,140
I'm not going to kiss you either.

86
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,530
Then straight to marriage?

87
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,290
No.

88
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,850
By any chance, do you have a woman already?

89
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,170
What do I say to my dad?

90
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,870
That his pretty, smart, and talented daughter got rejected immediately?

91
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:16,210
Tell him that I will pay him back another way. Also this.

92
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,970
What's this?

93
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,620
This is your mother's. Why would you give this to me?

94
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,230
You wanted it.

95
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,860
Wait. Let me settle this straight first.

96
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,320
Are you proposing to me with this or are you rejecting me?

97
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,810
It's neither. I'm handing it to you as a friend.

98
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,320
We're going to be just friends for the rest of our lives starting today then.

99
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,970
But I don't think this is a gift I should receive from a friend.

100
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,400
You should just keep it.

101
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,860
I had tea with you and heard the answer.

102
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,850
So I suppose it's polite for you to stay seated until I, the one that got rejected, leaves. Right?

103
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,980
Here.

104
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,960
With this handshake, let's forget about the whole marriage thing.

105
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,830
You'll regret it once I marry some other guy, you know.

106
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,980
Of course, I will regret it.

107
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,420
Women in my life

108
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,560
start and end with you.

109
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,550
I'm leaving now.

110
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,370
 I just want go ahead and get married. 

111
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,760
 This could be my last chance in this lifetime. 

112
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,770
 Go for it. 

113
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,800
 Really? 

114
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,050
 Is there a way? 

115
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,910
 What can't you do if you're willing to die? 

116
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,630
Master! Why are you throwing that away when that's your mom's belonging?

117
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,410
I want to be alone, so go away.

118
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,880
- But still— 
- Get lost!!!

138
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,940
Let's go...

139
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,620
home.

140
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,520
That's right!

141
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,240
What is?

142
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,520
The story about my friend. That story was all about me.

143
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,190
As you saw, I rejected her.

144
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,000
No, I mean... I got rejected.

145
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,090
Why are you being honest with me all of a sudden?

146
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,780
Because it's you.

147
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:44,380
Because I showed you everything, I feel like I won't be embarrassed even if I tell you the truth.

148
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:52,130
So we are good enough friends now to tell embarrassing stories to each other without feeling embarrassed about it?

149
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,000
It's so unfair.

150
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,340
I'm a human and I have so much to be embarrassed about,

151
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,670
but you are a robot that has nothing to be embarrassed about.

152
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,330
Can I ask you something?

153
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,360
Why would you give her your necklace when you just got dumped?

154
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,980
It's so precious to you after all.

155
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,090
I already told you.

156
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,920
That she's my first and last woman.

157
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,140
But someone else might appear.

158
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,990
That won't happen. Ever.

159
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,400
But what are you going to do if she appears?

160
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,510
Forget it.

161
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,190
You are a robot so what would you know about the numerous aspects of a human?

162
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,040
But I do realize that you need me right now.

163
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,060
I need you?

164
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,750
If not, then why are you holding my hand?

165
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,010
I wonder. Why am I holding your hand?

166
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,930
Oh! I'm all healed.

167
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,620
Oh, but I didn't even inject a shot today.

168
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,890
This is so strange.

169
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,250
Are you okay?

170
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,270
Hey, go away! I told them to empty out the cafe, so why are you here?!

171
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,190
Aish!

172
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,860
I didn't hear anything like that from my boss though.

173
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,980
I was wondering why there weren't any customers here.

174
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,880
Are you all right?

175
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,590
You okay?

176
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,220
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

177
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,390
No. I'm... I-I'm actually fine.

178
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,220
Th-There's nothing wrong with me, that's why.

179
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,470
That's a good thing, so what's the problem then?

180
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,590
This can't be though.

181
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,380
No. There's no way that I can be completely okay. Wait a minute.

182
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,550
Mister.

183
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,960
Can you please touch me here?

184
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Mister. Please mister. Mister! Mister!

185
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,810
Mister!! Mister!! Mister!!

186
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,140
You little bastard!!! Don't you ever come back here!!!

187
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,760
How dare you touch me!!! How dare you ask me to touch you!!!

188
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,430
   

189
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,630
Have you gone mad?

190
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,540
Is that man from earlier really your type?

191
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,300
Yeah, I have gone mad indeed.

192
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,780
I'm not in my right mind right now.

193
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,370
 Is he dealing with the pain of being dumped at this very moment? 

194
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,900
Why isn't he answering?

195
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,230
Do you need a change of surroundings?

196
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,130
Then let's go.

197
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,580
We're going to go into that crowd of people.

198
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,820
I will cheer you up today, my friend.

199
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,450
Let's go.

200
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,860
L-Let's go!

201
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,160
Hurry up!

202
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,000
Sorry about that.

203
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,230
I told you to stop.

204
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,150
Look at this. It's so cute.

205
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,210
Do you want me to buy you one?

206
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,740
But this is 9900 won. You don't have change?

207
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,240
What the heck is this?

208
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,400
I have leveled up to be the fourth Lovely.

209
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,440
What the heck?

210
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,460
Have a safe trip.

211
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,300
Let's take a photo together. Get your phone out.

212
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,870
- Hello. Please give me one ice cream cake.
 - Okay.

213
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,650
Would you like to press this once?

214
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,230
You mean, this right here?

215
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,650
This looks so fun.

216
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,150
So sorry.

217
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm okay.

218
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,070
Your girlfriend is very pretty.

219
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,060
What?! She's not my girlfriend.

220
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,600
Then you're just starting to like each other?

221
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
 Hello? Patient Kim? 

222
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,860
I was all healed, I was sure of it. But the reaction... It's happening again.

223
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Where you at right now? What about your medication? Do you have your syringe on you now?

224
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:03,370
No, I do not. I have nothing...

225
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,380
And nobody...

226
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,450
 Hello? Patient Kim? 

227
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:47,970
♫  I didn't believe it in the end  ♫

228
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,740
 Snap out of it. Is there anyone around you? 

229
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,850
There is someone.

230
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,650
♫  Were difficult  ♫

231
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:11,580
Doctor, when I see someone, the reaction disappears.

232
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,720
And when I don't see that someone, the reaction comes back.

233
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,410
♫  And I  ♫

234
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,140
Do you believe it?

235
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,660
 Pardon? What are you talking about? When you see a certain someone? 

236
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,890
♫  I want to say it  ♫

237
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,400
♫  I want to call you  ♫

238
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,560
She's not...

239
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,600
a human.

240
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,620
♫  The words of my heart  ♫

241
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,190
♫  No matter how much I shout, ♫ 

242
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,770
♫  It seems I can't hear you. ♫ 

243
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,300
♫  Every day, silently and just with my eyes  ♫

244
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:12,810
♫  I had to say the loving words I have for you  ♫

245
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,600
It was because of you.

246
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,970
It was because you were by my side.

247
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,440
♫  Always lingering by  my lips  ♫

248
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,400
I will buy you batteries. The longest lasting ones in this world.

249
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,530
♫  The words of my heart  ♫

250
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,880
Until I die, for the rest of my life,

251
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,260
be with me.

252
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Now you are my most precious treasure in the world.

253
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:05,550
♫  I had to say the loving words I have for you  ♫

254
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,310
That crazy bastard has finally lost it!

255
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,950
You freaking pervert! Where are you putting those dirty lips of yours?!

256
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,220
Do you think I sent her over to you to do this to her?!

257
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,080
You all right? Let's go.

258
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,590
Where do you think you're going?! Your master is right here.

259
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,380
What did I tell you earlier? Didn't I tell you to stand right next to me?!

260
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,340
I'm her master.

261
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,750
I'm the one that owns her!

262
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,340
I'm the one who made her!

263
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,960
There is only 5% of power left.

264
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,190
I'm going into standby mode to recharge.

265
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,940
You! Again?!

266
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,200
