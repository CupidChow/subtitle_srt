00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,430
This is the perfect timing for you to kiss someone.

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,680
 A person's temperature, 36.5 degrees. 

4
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,490
 I confess. 

5
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,020
 There was a time I longed for the warmth of 36.5 degrees. 

6
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,140
 Someone once said the first kiss tasted like apples. 

7
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,800
 Others have said it was like the first flower bud appearing at the end of a branch. 

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,570
 And some have said it was like the ocean  

9
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,120
 they saw for the first time in their lives. 

10
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,670
 I have imagined it countless times 

11
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,780
 the moment when the 36.5-degree lips will touch mine. 

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,370
 But the first lips to ever touch mine are— 

13
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,590
 A robot's?! 

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,100
You. What are you doing right now?

15
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,590
I'm supposed to do it. Why are you doing it?

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,460
You were going to do it to me?

17
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,520
Who said I was going to do it to you?

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,030
I'm sorry. I won't ever do it again.

19
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,200
Who said don't do it?

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,440
Then sh-should I do it again?

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,180
What? Do what? Do what again?

22
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,950
What are you, really? Why are you doing this to me?

23
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,660
Ahh, I can't be losing my mind because of you.

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm late, huh? Sorry.

25
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,520
You. What happened to your first love?

26
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,930
   

27
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,980
You have a strange hobby. You clearly knew I was on a date, yet you called me?

28
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,030
Why? What's so important?

29
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,890
 This is the perfect timing for you to kiss someone. 

30
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,410
Thanks for driving me.

31
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,600
Can you come by yourself?

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,110
Of course. The rain stopped, too. I'll go early in the morning.

33
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,630
♫  It seems like I will have time that I didn't have before  ♫

34
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,370
♫  Because I want to see you so much  ♫

35
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,490
♫  It seems like you, whom I want, will know my heart  ♫

36
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:15,810
- Crazy. Crazy. Why did your lips go to his at that moment? 
 ♫  I look forward to spending time with you  ♫

37
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,310
 I wonder how someone came up with this wonderful idea? 

38
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,150
  Maybe this person is a genius? Or an expert of some sort? 

39
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,950
He said the words I've been wanting to hear for my whole life with such delight on his face. How could I not go crazy?

40
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,120
♫  Will you understand me? Will you see me?  ♫

41
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,230
♫  My heart that worries  ♫

42
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,810
- What should I do?
♫  Is my heart that loves you  ♫

43
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,850
♫  As if you will definitely come to me  ♫

44
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,630
♫  To the point that I can't open my eyes  ♫

45
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,590
- You. Why did you do that to me?
 ♫  To the point my heart is strained in nervousness  ♫

46
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,250
♫  I love you  ♫

47
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,760
I can't do anything because of you. I'm going crazy.

48
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,680
Why did you do that? That was my first kiss!

49
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,130
You just stole my first kiss!

50
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:18,180
I've lived and lived to get my lips taken by a robot.

51
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,960
What are you going to do with this situation?

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,090
♫  Will you understand me?  ♫

53
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,520
Why in the world would she do that to me?

54
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,590
What wrong information did I input that...

55
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,970
 Don't forget the feeling, atmosphere, and eye contact from just now. 

56
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,020
 That was sexual tension and at that moment you kiss one another. 

57
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,830
 This is the perfect timing for you to kiss someone. 

58
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,220
Perhaps, that was a part of her deep learning?

59
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,380
No way. It's not like this is a sci-fi movie, right?

60
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,700
Wait a minute.

61
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,670
I almost got caught.

62
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,570
He passed over it because he's dumb.

63
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,980
You would've been caught immediately if he were a little smarter.

64
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,070
Let's be careful! Careful! Careful!

65
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,590
Is she charging?

66
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,120
But why does she feel so unfamiliar?

67
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:30,100
It feels like this is my first time seeing this per— No... Robot.

68
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,610
What is it?

69
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,310
I have something to ask AG-3.

70
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,350
As you can see, she's in the middle of charging.

71
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes, it seems that she is.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,790
Next time, please contact me ahead of time. That means for you to leave.

73
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,830
This is my house.

74
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,690
Should I stop charging AG-3?

75
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,550
Okay, then, let me ask you one thing.

76
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,600
Then when a robot... No, no, if AG-3's deep learning goes well,

77
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,520
can it develop feelings, too?

78
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,860
For example, like or dislike types of things?

79
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,080
We don't even know AG-3's limit of deep learning.

80
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,490
It depends on the level of detailed input by the owner.

81
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,600
So we can only predict that a reaction that is similar to an emotion could develop.

82
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,970
Like or dislike? It could express it.

83
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,440
Since our final goal is for the robot to hug and comfort the owner first after their relationship develops.

84
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,130
Hug first?

85
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,030
But it's not a real emotion.

86
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,100
So what you're saying is...

87
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,970
If we get really close, is that possible for her to do such things without the owner's command?

88
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:49,320
That's right. If that really happens, we'll end her test and study her in the lab. Why?

89
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,890
Test.

90
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,570
Nothing. It's nothing. Keep working.

91
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,760
Seriously. Just how close does she think we are?

92
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,400
As expected, this robot has no common sense.

93
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:32,680
 I want to meet the person who invented this umbrella.
 

94
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,490
This fool. That person is right under your nose.

95
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,330
Also, I'm not a robot. I'm a person.

96
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,760
When the test is over, I'm going to tell you everything.

97
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,120
The robot seems to like you?

98
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,110
It's not like we're filming a Hollywood movie, so how is that possible?

99
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,360
I already checked it with the research team.

100
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,610
So you see, if she succeeds in deep learning, she is able to show emotions.

101
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,850
However...

102
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,650
I think she likes me too much.

103
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,350
Gosh, this is a nuisance.

104
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,400
Are you bragging to me right now that a robot likes you?

105
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Aigoo. What are you saying? This is nothing to brag about.

106
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,570
It's the first time someone has liked you in 15 years.

107
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,960
As soon as I return to Korea, I'll check with my own eyes.

108

109
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,370
Feeling acceptance from someone is a very good sign.

110
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,610
Hello, Doctor.

111
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,510
- Nice to me you. Everyone's inside. 
- Good.

112
00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:00,340
Oh, hi, Doctor. I'm Johnny Brown. This is my girlfriend, Tilda Morton. She's a nurse.

113
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,190
- Thanks for allowing this meeting. 
- Yeah, thank you.

114
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,910
Are you all right? Shall we open the window?

115
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,360
No, it's okay. I used to have the symptoms whenever I was in the same space with other people,

116
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,410
but it has gotten a lot better and that's all because of Tilda. I mean,

117
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:23,290
she's the only person I trust. I love you Tilda. So, so much.

118
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,530
I love you, too, Johnny.

119
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,240
I just can't believe there's another person in the universe that's like me.

120
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,650
My patient is getting better through the assistance of a special robot.

121
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:38,080
Yeah, so I'm guessing to your patient, the robot must be like Tilda is to myself.

122
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,220
When the test is over, from where should I begin explaining?
    

123
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,890
I'm not sure if this idiot will be able to understand me.

124
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,780
"I'm a person. We are meant to be."

125
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,200
"That umbrella? I made that."

126
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,760
"Do you know that I saved your life twice?"

127
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,910
Just you wait, Kim Min Kyu.

128
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:14,250
But did AG-3 kiss me or was it a peck?

129
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,090
But will he like that I'm a person?

130
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,060
   

131
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,020
♫  Don't frown  ♫

132
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,570
What am I going to do? What am I going to do?

133
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,170
Hello?

134
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,710
What?

135
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:55,560
Money. Y-You still need to give me my ₩300,000.

136
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,800
I don't want to.

137
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,940
If you don't want to, then goodbye.

138
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll give it to you! If you answer my question well.

139
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,280
- What?
 - Well... Generally...

140
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:18,280
If two lips touch, is that considered... a kiss?

141
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,160
- It's a kiss. 
- Not a peck?

142
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,930
Was it a jok or a joooooook?

143
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,950
Jooooooook?

144
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,870
Then, it's 100% a kiss.

145
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,770
Even if it only passes a second, you should technically consider it a kiss.

146
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,930
As expected, it was a kiss.

147
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Did you like it?

148
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,510
Did your heart flutter?

149
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,440
Ah, I was totally taken aback, flabbergasted, and dumbfounded.

150
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,320
Listen. If all of a sudden, without any common sense—

151
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,190
Hello, CEO Jo?

152
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,500
She must not have had someone who liked her. I must've hurt her feelings.

153
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,390
 I was totally taken aback, flabbergasted, and dumbfounded. 

154
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,830
 Without common sense— If all of a sudden, without any common sense— 

155
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,000
 Someone will end up liking you, too. Cheer up. 
  

156
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,040
So this is how it feels

157
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,860
to receive one-sided love from someone.

158
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,880
It's the feeling of having a hundred tons of gold bars in my house.

159
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,440
 We used to go out on dates like that a lot back in the day. 

160
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,720
 What are you saying? We never came out to this kind of place for dates. 

161
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,190
 Yes, we have! Think about it carefully. 

162
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,430
-  You just can't remember it, that's all. 
 - Where's everyone?

163
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,700
They went out to get coffee, but it seems like they're lost.

164
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,460
What about Jo Ji Ah?

165
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,230
She'll be back soon. She said she had something to do.

166
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,470
Ah, it was such a bother having to take her around places.

167
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,800
You seem to be in a good mood.

168
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,960
What do you mean? It was so annoying having to take care of her and tend to her.

169
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,020
Then don't go.

170
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,600
- What?
 - You said it was annoying.

171
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,980
I'll go then next time.

172
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:08,700
For me to tell you to do such a thing is...

173
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,370
It was nice.

174
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,980
Do you want to start again?

175
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,730
Yeah. After spending time with her, it became certain.

176
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,960
Did you find out the reason why she decided to leave you?

177
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,850
No. Still,  that's all in the past. If we start again well, then—

178
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,380
Machines, too, if you don't fix the root of the problem, they keep on breaking.

179
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,440
It could end again for the same reason after hurting each other.

180
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,690
No matter how much I think about it, I don't know.

181
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,080
How about looking for the starting point?

182
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,740
Starting point?

183
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,930
For example, the moment you felt the sorriest toward Jo Ji Ah.

184
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,330
If you start there, couldn't you find the reason for the breakup, too?

185
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,120
I love it so much that I can eat the last one.

186
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,660
Punk, there's another one.

187
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,860
What is this? Did something happen to you yesterday? Why are your eyes so red?

188
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:17,430
Oppas, I can't think straight because I went back and forth from a hot tub to a cold one repeatedly yesterday.

189
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,790
- Do you— 
- Did you go to the sauna yesterday?

190
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,150
You're a robot right now. Please remember that.

191
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,330
I have it engraved deep down inside my heart and bones.

192
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,550
Where in the world do we have a robot that has red eyes? Open your eyes.

193
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,320
- Give it to me. I'll do it myself.
 - Open your eyes. I need to take a look at them.

194
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,760
Are you a ghost? Don't open them so wide.

195
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,730
Does it hurt you to say things nicely?

196
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,880
Why would you call me a ghost?

197
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,870
Sorry.

198
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,480
When will AG-3 be completely fixed?

199
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,920
I need to slowly start doing my own things.

200
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,720
It's almost done. Almost.

201
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,010
It will be done by the weekend. I'll make sure it's fixed by then.

202
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,350
Thank you.

203
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,930
You can speak comfortably to me, too.

204
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,210
This is comfortable for me.

205
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,590
Did my brother have his first kiss last night?

206
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,350
I'm not quite sure.

207
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,630
It probably wasn't easy for him.

208
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,100
But who knows, the girl might have kissed him first?

209
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:02,050
He needs to have his first kiss, so I can tell him these words.

210
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,120
Sun Hye told me that...

211
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,260
 The day after the first kiss is important. 

212
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,680
 If one decides to not remember what happened, 

213
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,550
 that's when the game of playing hard to get starts. 

214
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,820
Did you get fully charged throughout the night?

215
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes, Master.

216
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,720
All of it was my fault.

217
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,730
I gave you the wrong input, so that's why you became this way.

218
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,410
 What's wrong with the way I am? 

219
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,640
Listen to this well, AG-3.

220
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,220
Open some wires and listen to this very well.

221
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,490
You can't love me.

222
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,420
Although you can be my closest friend,

223
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,210
you can't be the woman I love.

224
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,730
 You were the one that told me to be with you until the day you died. 

225
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:03,060
So you can't do what you did last night ever again, okay?

226
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,720
What do you mean by what I did last night?

227
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,120
- What?
 - Did I do something last night?

228
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,410
Last night... you... k-ki- me, don't you remember?

229
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,340
Did something happen between us last night?

230
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,640
Are you giving me the cold shoulder right now?

231
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,960
Those types of words don't fit you, Master.

232
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Ah, you can't remember because you're in operation mode?

233
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,410
Friend mode.

234
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,170
- What?
 - What? Your words are getting shorter.

235
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,910
If you called me, then state your business.

236
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,350
Are you mad at me about something?

237
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,150
I don't understand what you're trying to say. Can you say it again?

238
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,550
No, why are you switching to operation mode all of a sudden?

239
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,830
Due to error, only operation mode is possible for the time being.

240
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,000
You must be kidding me. AG-3, friend mode.

241
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,110
Due to error, only operation mode is possible for the time being.

242
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,420
Hey! How c-could you do that do me last night and

243
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,660
be like this? That's rude.

244
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm not quite sure what I did, but I won't ever do it again.

245
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,980
Who told you not to do it again?

246
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,270
Then should I do it again?

247
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,270
What? What? Do what again? What?

248
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,850
You do remember everything you did last night, right?

249
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,670
Did something happen last night, Master?

250
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,870
AG-3, you seriously!

251
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,910
I prepared myself so much for my first kiss,

252
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,740
but someone intercepted my first kiss.

253
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,090
Therefore, I have to prepare myself again.

254
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,530
Won't you give me some ideas, Goddess of Kiss?

255
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,130
Wow, he is dying from feeling wronged.

256
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:01,110
Just who could've stolen someone else's first kiss?

257
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,410
I can't even undo this.

258
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,320
- Then you have to do it properly this time.
 - How?

259
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,810
Have a cozy date where physical contact is possible.

260
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,870
For example, a drive.

261
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,530
Are you just going to continue to interrupt?!

262
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,380
It's because you keep following and watching me like a dog that I can't do anything!

263
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,950
Then just go by yourself.

264
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,190
She needs to be there for me to be able to kiss someone.

265
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,980
You two are having quite a unique fling.

266
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,510
Fling?

267
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,650
She drives me nuts.

268
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,540
I was afraid of this. Did you fix it yet?

269
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,120
I pretended like nothing happened.

270
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,130
I went on pretending like it was erased due to an error.

271
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,160
Hey, how can you pretend like nothing happened?

272
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,890
Pi, do I really not talk very nicely?

273
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,090
Based on general standards, yes.

274
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,210
How much?

275
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,120
Since we're close with you, no matter what you say, we can see the main point.

276
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,130
But normal people find the manners surrounding the context important as well.

277
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,190
Are my manners that bad?

278
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,720
Based on general standards, yes.

279
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,450
As for me, I don't see it like that.

280
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,780
I think I found it.

281
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,880
The memory of when I felt sorriest toward Jo Ji Ah.

282
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,790
 - You came? 
 - Why did you do something I didn't ask for? Think before you act! 

283
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,510
 Who told you to clear the stuff here? Are you some maid? 

284
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,570
How could I not remember after saying something like that?

285
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,630
Are you really human?

286
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,870
You're saying that's the reason you broke up?

287
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,070
It's not even raining, so why are you holding an umbrella?

288
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,510
Take a good look at this umbrella. Doesn't it remind you of something?

289
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,960
Nope.

290
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,060
A memory that's related to this umbrella should be stored in the wrong place somewhere.

291
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,280
Hurry up and recall it.

292
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say.

293
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,900
Even like this?

294
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,190
Hurry up and find that memory.
