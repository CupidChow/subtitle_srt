1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,210
That can't be. I really cherish this, so how could I forget it?

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,470
Could it be that it's a joke that some god is playing?

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,170
I'm not sure about that.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,710
Where it's joined, if the pressure and friction lose their balance,

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,290
because of gravity, it drops like this. Yes, that's right.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,980
I did my job delivering it to you, so I must get going now—

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,920
You're going to leave already? You don't want a cup of coffee?

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,190
I forgot to bring my wallet with me, so I will definitely buy a drink next time.

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,520
You could drink it on credit then.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,130
My family motto is all about not being indebted to anyone.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,600
What kind of a man is he?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,660
Pardon?

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,460
- Didn't you just say something to me? 
- I did?

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,440
- It sounded like it.
 - I didn't say anything.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,920
Sun Hye. Hoktal?

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
Hey, Sunbae.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,890
- You're here. 
- Yup.

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,260
- When? What is it?
 - What?

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,670
- Nothing. You bought new clothes. 
- Tell me. Your inner feelings.

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,100
Sun Hye forgot something so I came here to bring it to her.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,290
Okay, then leave. Sun Hye. Oh dear!

22
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,090
I guess you are preparing to get your eyes done.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,290
Sun Hye,  a cup of Americano please.

24
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,570
Latte for me.

25
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,080
Here's your latte and your Americano.

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,300
Thank you for the drink.

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,220
Sun Hye, once they start playing hard to get,

28
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,890
which one usually gets played?

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,650
The one that gets angry first.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,420
Young Master, I am responsible for this job.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,900
AG-3 will be doing everything from here on out.

32
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,530
What are you looking at? Hurry up and move those boxes.

33
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,750
Hurry.

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,280
It'll take forever if you move them one by one.

35
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,250
Master, I thought that I was your treasure. Aren't you supposed to be more careful with what's valuable to you?

36
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,390
Yeah, right.

37
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,490
Where else would I use a robot that can't properly save information?

38
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,240
I have to use it for manual labor.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,490
After you're done cleaning that, there are some books in the office. Those.

40
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,020
Reorder them by publication date, got it?

41
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,920
What?

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Master, my batteries will drain faster if I work like this.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,080
From my observation, your batteries seem to be lasting a lot longer lately.

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,910
What's wrong? Are you tired?

45
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,120
No, of course not.

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,100
My arms and legs are made out of titanium after all.

47
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,060
Oh my, look at this dust here. Why is there so much dust?

48
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,280
Make sure to dust here once you're done.

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,990
I'm just a freaking servant here.

50
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,970
What the? He didn't even open any of these?

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,090
That cold-blooded human.

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,560
She's wiping the windows?

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,600
That crazy jerk!

54
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,410
Are you out of your mind?

55
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,310
How could you be using a world-class android robot to just clean the windows, huh?!

56
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,990
What's wrong with cleaning?! It's a very sacred work, you know.

57
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,720
Or should I clean and leave the robot standing around?

58
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,550
I will do it.

59
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,820
Are you crazy?

60
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,930
What are you doing?

61
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,360
It's because I just can't bear to see my robot holding onto some cleaning rag.

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,640
Does it feel like a waste to you?

63
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,700
Of course. I can't even look at her too often (for the fear that she'll wear out.)

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,330
Seriously, you are so troublesome.

65
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,320
Hey, you go and fold that umbrella back up.

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,810
No, don't.

67
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,960
I will fold it up for you.

68
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,250
I wonder why you are acting so overboard today?

69
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,340
It's because I'm the one who made this umbrella.

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,110
R-Really?

71
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,090
 - No, it isn't!  
- It's true.

72
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,040
 I'm telling you that's not true! It's me! 

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,890
 This little moldy bastard! 

74
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,020
Yeah, right.

75
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,820
There is no way that idea came from you, Doctor.

76
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,980
It's a little more... genius.

77
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,560
That umbrella is.

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,590
 My IQ is only 94 though. 

79
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,840
Forget it. Just come and take a look at this.

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,130
That's the bird's eye view of Santa Maria's new research center.

81
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,440
- A total of 2000 square meters altogether. 
 - Wow, it's 2000 square meters. 

82
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,060
A perfect accommodation that allows you to live your life without even setting your foot outdoors.

83
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,680
Top class, superior, and newest—

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,910
Everything is cool and all.

85
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,360
But no matter how much I look at it, I have a hard time finding anything resembling a customized welfare system.

86
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,100
Even after seeing this awesome bird's eye view,

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,890
you still want me to create a customized welfare system?

88
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,090
First of all, for Ssanip, eating is important.

89
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,420
It would be great if we could have a cafeteria where we could eat three meals a day. A beer fridge as a service.

90
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,990
And Hoktal is unexpectedly sensitive and also nature friendly.

91
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,490
It would be great if there was a greenhouse next to the lab. A swimming pool as a service.

92
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,110
- And for Pi. 
 - What about a welfare system for me?

93
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,680
You are just a robot!

94
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,530
Oh man!

95
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,970
Fine, I will forget it for life then. For life.

96
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,750
How is it, Pi?

97
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,700
After we modify it one more time, I think we'll be able to reduce the amount.

98
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,660
I feel the same way. Let's work hard one more time.

99
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,090
Okay, Doctor.

100
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,220
Jo Ji Ah is going through a lot because of you, so let's get back up on your feet.

101
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,830
It seems like you're concerned about Miss Jo Ji Ah.

102
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,390
Of course, I am.

103
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,660
This is the perfect timing for you to kiss someone.

104
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,360
Where in the hell did you learn to say that?

105
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,240
I think it's Hwang Sun Hye.

106
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,180
Why would you learn to say something like that? Kim Min Kyu should have learned it.

107
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,790
This, over here...

108
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,230
Sandwich delivery.

109
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,350
Let's have a sandwich party!

110
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,390
We're back! Have some before getting back to work, guys.

111
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,050
We're now free from sandwich prohibition, right? It was really frustrating for me.

112
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,360
Why did you order seven sandwiches? We won't be able to finish it.

113
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,100
The person that has a big appetite is supposed to order food.

114
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,890
Don't worry because I'll eat it all.

115
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,290
 If you don't finish it, you're going to get it. 

116
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,670
 I'm hungry, so let's order two large meals. 

117
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,950
 That's too much. Who's going to finish it? 

118
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,360
 We can order a medium meal with an additional sandwich. 

119
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,530
 I would like the sandwich heated please. 

120
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,440
Yeah, I suppose the robot is innocent in this matter.

121
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,300
The person to blame is the person that can't seem to forget.

122
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,900
Since it's a robot, it's possible for it to have errors and to delete things.

123
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,360
Okay, that was neatly concluded indeed.

124
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,200
All right!

125
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,350
No, it's not neatly concluded after all.

126
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,930
I'm not able to completely work this through.

127
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,620
Hi, AG-3!

128
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,750
Welcome, Chairman Kim Min Kyu.

129
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,470
But why aren't you calling me "Master?"

130
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,330
Master version of the operating system is running at the moment.

131
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:52,100
In order for me to run an operating system for you, Chairman Kim, the master operating system must end.

132
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,030
The only AG-3 in this place...

133
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,850
is you, right?

134
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,500
At the moment, there is only one of AG-3

135
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,850
constructed by Santa Maria.

136
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,930
Even if it's cloned, it will have the same performance.

137
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,060
You are my AG-3?

138
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,330
I can't believe it.

139
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,690
A person who can't trust anyone can't be trusted by others.

140
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,820
 A person who can't trust anyone can't be trusted by others. 

141
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:41,400
AG-3. What does it mean to train someone?

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,240
 Training is to build a relationship. 

143
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,970
Training is to build a relationship.

144
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,350
When did you say that? You said it was about input.

145
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,700
 The problem is the content being input. 

146
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,810
The problem is the content being input.

147
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,930
 But it's not a real emotion. 

148
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,850
 It's not. 

149
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,040
You feel so real like this; however,

150
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,770
you're fake?

151
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,600
Fine. Let's forget what happened yesterday and act normal.

152
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,810
Because you're Kim Min Kyu's closest friend and most precious treasure.

153
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,780
Master?

154
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,310
I'm hungry.

155
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,330
Do you want to have some?

156
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,990
I'm just joking.

157
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,210
You don't seem to be in a good mood today.

158
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,090
I'm smiling right now, so how can you know I'm not in a good mood?

159
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,160
Since I've been watching over you this whole time.

160
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:38,160
Deep learning? That's right. It's your job to watch people.

161
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,740
You observe everyone around you without being particular about whom.

162
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,390
That's really funny. Right?

163
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:12,910
Are you laughing because it's really funny or are you laughing because you should be?

164
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,170
Are you still mad about what happened yesterday?

165
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,910
The weather is nice. I should do some laundry.

166
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,710
Should I do it?

167
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,780
No need.

168
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,130
Isn't it hard?

169
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,600
It is hard.

170
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,870
Even if you step over these a hundred times, it won't be hard for you. Right?

171
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,550
It must be nice.

172
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:53,770
You... didn't erase it, right?

173
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,280
You remember everything, right?

174
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,130
I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say, Master.

175
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:11,860
  ♫ I've been sick for days ♫  

176
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,680
  ♫ because my heart is overwhelmed by you ♫  

177
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,670
I really hate this.

178
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,360
Do you know just looking at you makes me mad?

179
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,480
You're a robot, so to what extent will you make a fool out of me, a human?

180
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,560
  ♫ even if I'm beside you ♫  

181
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,330
Input this. From this moment forward, I'm not your friend.

182
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,590
You did something a friend should not do.

183
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,410
Also from now on, make sure that only operation mode is used.

184
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:45,060
If I don't ask for it and friend mode comes on, I will forcefully reset you.

185
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,010
  ♫ I want to talk ♫  

186
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,800
Leave.

187
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,360
I...

188
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,040
still have some battery left.

189
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,990
I want to be alone.

190
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,030
  ♫ repeating the words in my mind ♫  

191
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,680
Go.

192
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,250
  ♫ You don't seem to hear it. ♫ 

193
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,890
  ♫ I only expressed it internally and through the look in my eyes, 

194
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:36,200
  ♫ and those were the words of love towards you ♫  

195
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,160
  ♫ I've always kept the words on my lips ♫  

196
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,920
  ♫ and constantly repeated internally ♫  

197
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,510
♫   No matter how much I yell it, ♫ 

198
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,970
♫   You don't seem to hear it. ♫ 

199
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,820
That...

200
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,660
was all fake?

201
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,910
♫  What I had to tell you  ♫

202
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,740
It had no meaning?

203
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,490
   

204
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:33,420
Soon Yoo Cheol will be the largest stockholder and be promoted as chairman.

205
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,020
What do you think about him as your son-in-law?

206
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,570
  
  

207
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,820
You've borrowed quite a few stocks.

208
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,240
At the upcoming board of directors meeting, I'm going to suggest the dismissal of Chairman Kim Min Kyu.

209
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,020
How much money has Kim Min Kyu earned for us?

210
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,370
I don't know the reason why you would dismiss him.

211
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:11,490
When the purchase of borrowed name stocks is completed this month, then the largest shareholder will change.

212
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,780
Then even without the majority of the votes, I can have the chairman dismissed.

213
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,670
It's going to happen anyway, so why waste our energy? Don't you agree?

214
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,930
I don't think so. Unless there happens to be a huge flaw making him unable to fulfill his job as a chairman,

215
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,150
my shares are on Chairman Kim's side.

216
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,850
I promised that on the day when the late Chairman Kim passed away.

217
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,930
Then I'll leave first.

218
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:45,180
Seong Tae, I'm giving you an opportunity right now.

219
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,880
When there's an opportunity, you have to seize it.

220
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:58,500
I don't care about the heirs. I care about the value of  the corporation.

221
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,490
Just like Chairman Kim Myung Hoon.

222
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,410
Prepare so that as soon as Kim Min Kyu is dismissed, CEO Martin can receive the contract right away.

223
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,550
Yes, President.

224
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,610
There are no particular movements from Kim Min Kyu's side. Right?

225
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,800
I think they're looking for Jang Doo San.

226
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,110
He's the driver of late Chairman Park Seong Jin of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

227
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,980
Is he here right now?

228
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,910
He left the day before yesterday.

229
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,010
If he comes back, tell him to call this number.

230
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,990
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

231
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,780
The velveteen rabbit asked,

232
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,040
"Mr. Horse, do I need a wind-up in order to become real?"

233
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,490
  "No, that's not how you become real." 

234
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,850
  "If someone loves you for a very long time, you can become real." 

235
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,190
 "Does becoming real hurt?" 

236
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:11,460
  "There are times when it can hurt." The stuffed animal horse looked at the velveteen rabbit and smiled. 

237
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,090
This is crazy. Was my brother this strong?

238
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,970
If AG-3 becomes open to the public and if Doctor's interview gets published, everything will be solved.

239
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,580
What's this about?

240
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,380
Doctor was slandered for stealing his colleague's work in the US.

241
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,640
Actually, that colleague betrayed him in order to take all of the credit.

242
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,420
I've known it for a while since I joined after our doctor came back to Korea,

243
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,120
and when I heard, my blood boiled.

244
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,490
What an American bastard. Did you just leave him alone?

245
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:49,080
Because I and Pi might bear the brunt of it, Doctor just handed over the research results.

246
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,150
That's a little cool of you, Doctor Hong.

247
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,070
But our brother mobilized all his networks

248
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,650
to recover Doctor's reputation right now.

249
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,780
Kim Min Kyu is pretty cool.

250
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,960
He's so cool. I feel proud, right Doctor?

251
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,750
The bird's-eye view of our new research facility came out.

252
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,300
Your dream laboratory which contains everything you want will be constructed.

253
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,160
Then,

254
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,110
let's party!

255
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,430
A party?

256
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:25,730
Today there was an update from MIT saying that they're ready to reinstate my research team's and my reputation.

257
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,420
And who endured all these hardships?

258
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,400
Santa Maria!

259
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,700
And who made all of this possible?

260
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,270
Brother!

261
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,240
Cheers!

262
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,580
Cheers!

263
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,260
Brother, Brother!

264
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,570
I'm craving some liquor today.

265
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,110
It's a pie in the sky.

266
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,890
You should have some appetizers.

267
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,740
- I can't eat food that others have made. 
 - Oh, I see.

268
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,220
A random game that Hoktal likes.

269
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,200
- Nose goes. Dibs, 1! 
 - Two!
 - Two!

270
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,700
It's you guys!

271
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,660
It's you guys! Take a love shot.

272
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,650
Then, now, it's my turn right? A matched couple has to buy ice cream.

273
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,820
Son Byeong Ho game, start! We will go around this way.

274
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,580
Sounds good.

275
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,450
Fold one finger if you are from the US.

276
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,220
Fold!

277
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,830
Take a finger away if you're a girl.

278
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,300
Fold one finger if you're not from the US.

279
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,580
- Take a finger away if you're a boy. 
 - Hey.

280
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,640
Take a finger away if you have curly hair.

281
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,030
Pass!

282
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,990
Take a finger away if you're wearing glasses.

283
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,970
Take a finger away if you're wearing white.

284
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,620
A couple has formed!

285
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,360
- Goodbye. 
 - Have a good time.

286
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,420
The moon outside is really bright today. Don't you want to go see it?

287
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,280
It's a crescent moon today.

288
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,490
Let's go see the moon.

289
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,310
But you're my moon... a sad one.

290
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,470
Oh, he's drunk again.

291
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,830
- Okay, let's go see the moon. 
 - Let's go.

292
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,760
Leave everything here, and let's go.

293
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,480
Stop drinking.

294
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,310
Just go.

295
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,840
You are drunk.

296
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,940
I know.

297
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,790
I think it'll be better if you return home.

298
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,410
I don't want to.

299
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,190
Please let go of my hand.

300
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,070
I'm doing it just in case you leave.

301
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,120
I can't be without you.

302
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,170
That's something that you shouldn't say to a friend.

303
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,600
You should get up.

304
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,930
Let's play a game. The game you learned a moment ago.

305
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:10,630
Take a finger away if you've been kissed by a robot.

306
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:20,190
And another if you felt dumbfounded when that happened.

307
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:33,850
And another if you were angry because of it.

308
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:47,380
And! Another if you hated that robot because of it.

309
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:09,500
If you had hoped that the robot was a human...

310
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,300
♫  Loving with all of your heart  ♫

311
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,650
...fold a finger.

312
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:26,010
♫  How can a person do that?  ♫

313
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,720
♫  I really am jealous  ♫

314
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:42,790
♫  Because I'm scared of getting more hurt, I take a step back   ♫

315
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:55,150
I'm not a robot.

316
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:01,630
♫  Loving with all of your heart  ♫

317
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:10,970
♫  How can a person do it?  ♫

318
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:18,300
♫  It doesn't happen as your heart wishes  ♫

319
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:27,800
♫  Like you before, I want to love like that  ♫

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,320
  Let's start with an engagement. 

322
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,800
  You're not a good person. 

323
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,670
  Why are you doing this to me? 

324
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,530
  That's what I want to ask you. Why are you doing this to me?  

325
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,100
  Let's not see each other again. Take care. 

326
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,500
  I've told you not to treat her carelessly. 

327
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,330
  You're talking as if someone hurt the robot. 

328
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,730
  That friend always stares at you, Min Kyu. 

329
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,760
  Where your eyes go, that's where your mind goes too.  

330
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,480
  I didn't know this whole time? 

331
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,600
♫  I love you  ♫
