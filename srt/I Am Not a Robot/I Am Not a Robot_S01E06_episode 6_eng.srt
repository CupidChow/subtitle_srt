1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:19,210


2
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,420
   

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
Hi, AG-3.

4
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,630
I love you, Master. What would you like?

5
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,180
Okay.

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,330
- Come home.
 - Yes, Master.

7
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,660
- Wow.
 - It's a remote control system.

8
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,100
Baton requested it.

9
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,470
- So... did you sleep well? 
- Yes, Master.

10
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,610
What do you mean you slept? I bet you were just charging up your batteries.

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,050
So how's the weather today?

12
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,940
Today's weather will be sunny.

13
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,810
The highest temperature today will be 5 degrees Celsius so it's a nice day to go out.

14
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,700
- KOSPI? 
- Today's Korea Composite Stock Price Index is 2530.67.

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,180
It's 1.87 points lower than yesterday's.

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,070
I suggest that you hold onto the blue chips and sell off part of the stocks that you have.

17
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,620
Very convenient indeed.

18
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,640
The sunlight is very nice.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,910
So how about a walk in the park, Master?

20
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,040
What do you mean a walk? You need a scolding first.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,320
AG-3, what was there before?

22
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,890
There was a castle made out of cards.

23
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,430
But I wonder why it's not there right now.

24
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,720
- You must have put it away, Master.
 - Uh-huh.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,320
I did put it away because there was a beagle that made a big old mess.

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,630
Should I rebuild it for you?

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,780
You? The amount of time it took me to build that card castle is 15 years.

28
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,300
Fifteen years?!

29
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,440
The one that I first built with my father when I was a kid,

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,600
I built upon it by myself until now.

31
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:19,850
So when you knocked it down, I was really mad, but

32
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,880
look.

33
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,300
This window happens to bring in a lot of sunlight.

34
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,820
I really love sitting beneath this window.

35
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,310
All this time, I kept thinking that it was dark.

36
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,770
But I never thought that it was because of those cards.

37
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,690
Make sure to input this face, this emotion.

38
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,330
AG-3, because you brought back sunshine into the remaining part of my life,

39
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,720
your master is very happy right now.

40
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,630
 Just continue to be your psychotic self. You're hard to get used to. 

41
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,600
And also...

42
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,870
Hey, when you're cleaning up, you should be well aware of your surroundings!

43
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,940
There are things here that are more expensive than you—
 No, there aren't.

44
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,850
Oh. You're the most expensive.

45
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,030
Go and hide. Don't come outside no matter what you do, okay?

46
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,860
Yes, Ahjussi. Tell Doctor Hong and the other researchers to not come out of their building no matter what, okay?

47
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,390
What are you doing?! Hurry up and go hide already!

48
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes. Yes, Master.

49
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,010
I came over to your house and played a lot back in the day, right?

50
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,850
Get to the point.

51
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,570
What's the reason you broke the contract anyway?

52
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,700
Let me hear the reason. I'm the CEO after all.

53
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,290
A CEO after all?

54
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,580
You should be glad that you weren't removed from your position.

55
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,670
So what's the reason?!

56
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,050
M&amp;A is about buying something that's worth 10,000 won for 500 won then selling it for 5,000 won.

57
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,460
It's a waste of time if you buy something worth 1,000 won for 500 won and selling it for 600 won.

58
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,610
But it looks like you've been wasting time with Daeyang Shipbuilding.

59
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,850
- But there was no loss. 
- We just earned enough to pay out.

60
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,470
After wasting and wasting more time.

61
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,550
Chairman Martin said that he  will pay you double for the contract fees.

62
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,350
Are you still going to break the contract?

63
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,860
The more you open your mouth, the more it seems that you don't deserve to be the CEO.

64
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,930
Hey! There's only so much I can take.

65
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,860
Don't. I never told you to endure.

66
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,500
Not even once.

67
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,370
AG-3, do you know who those two are?

68
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,910
The one on the left is President Hwang Do Won of KM Financial.

69
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,170
The one on the right is CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol of KM Financial.

70
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,760
- They are both known as gentlemen of the financial-- 
 - Who said they are gentlemen?!

71
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,190
That's fake news, so delete it!

72
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,760
AG-3, make sure to input this in your head.

73
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,010
Those two men are the primary enemies of your master.

74
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,950
Out of my enemies, they're the main ones.

75
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,840
Why is that?

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,040
It's a long story so just input it in your head.

77
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,170
So if you ever run into them, hide no matter what.

78
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,740
Your face can't be shown to them. Make sure to hide very well.

79
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,510
But why?

80
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,830
Those two might know that you are a robot.

81
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,600
Then...

82
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,240
they might destroy you.

83
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,510
AG-3, do you know how to make drip coffee?

84
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,480
Of course, I do. I used to work at a cafe for three yea—

85
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,300
Two cups of coffee to the garden. We have a guest.

86
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,970
I think a new team leader will be appointed to Social Contributions.

87
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,920
CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol will be nominating a new face himself.

88
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,340
Wasting time again since I'm going to get rid of that team.

89
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,850
- Next.
 - Next is regarding the issue that you gave instructions for last time.

90
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,920
The other day, President Hwang Do Won's corporate credit card was used at a hotel.

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,840
- So?
 - Currently, Chairman Martin of Bold Group is staying at that hotel.

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,660
 Wait, why is my brother over there? 

93
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,490
Should I look into Chairman Martin as well?

94
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,920
 He should be in court right now, so why is he with that psychopath? Why? 

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,670
Bring it over.

96
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,400
Hey!

97
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,280
Hey, what are you doing? What's up with your hair?

98
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,250
It's because the wind keeps blowing.

99
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,230
Who is...?

100
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,500
It's AG-3, don't you know?

101
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,360
I didn't have a chance to see it last time.

102
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,360
You should say hello now that you've seen it properly.

103
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,280
AG-3, this is our company's investigation team leader, Jo Jin Bae.

104
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,220
Hello.

105
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,840
Ah, yes.

106
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,960
It has a familiar feeling so it does seem human.

107
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,520
Stay there.

108
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,310
 Ah... just let me to go inside. 

109
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,130
Have you found a way to sue CEO Jo?

110
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,210
No, because you told me it was fine last time.

111
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,880
I only said it was fine because there were other matters at hand. I didn't mean to drop it entirely.

112
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,010
I'm sorry, Chairman.

113
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,320
Do you think you'll be able to stay long in our company with that kind of performance?

114
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,730
I'm really sorry.

115
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,450
 No, why is my brother bowing his head down like that? 

116
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,410
When I go back, I'll look into the situation immediately.

117
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,320
 Stop it! Don't bow your head down to that jerk! 

118
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,050
No, it's fine. I have something to receive from her for now,

119
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,720
but if I don't get it, then proceed to sue her.

120
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,760
For now, just put it on hold.

121
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,680
Yes, Chairman.

122
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,150
Leave.

123
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,630
 Is there anyone inside? 

124
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,450
 There's something I need to get fixed. 

125
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,390
I should just...

126
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,960
Should I input Team Leader Jo Jin Bae as a friend or foe?

127
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm still not sure. I'm in the middle of testing him. Put him into an uncategorized folder.

128
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,530
Why don't you know? I knew it the moment I saw him.

129
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,240
Really? Then, to you, what type of person is he?

130
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,630
Honest, hardworking, upright, and very sincere.

131
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,680
- That's right.
 - What?

132
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,870
Someone also said exactly what you said.

133
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,690
Who?

134
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,040
Whether he's a spy or a white knight,
   

135
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,390
I have yet to identify this anonymous person.

136
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,320
However, that's what other people judge him as.

137
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,760
I don't know what type of person he will be around me.

138
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,980
Take off your clothes.

139
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,080
We're going out. Change into these clothes.

140
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,510
Hurry up.

141
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,300
I have to take my clothes off though.

142
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,370
Okay. Change.

143
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,420
You should leave, so I can change.

144
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm going to help in case your arm might get dislocated while you're changing.

145
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,840
Please leave.

146
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,590
I saw everything already.

147
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,900
Sun Hye, everyone is gathered. Right?

148
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm leaving now. Take good care of it.

149
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,770
Take the upcoming right.

150
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,720
Are you sure this is right? This doesn't seem right.

151
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,390
An accident happened 10 minutes ago, so we're taking a different route.

152
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,130
A detour will take more time. You should've asked me first.

153
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,340
It's a chronically congested area.

154
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,610
Are you getting mad at me right now?

155
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,620
In about 100 meters, take a right.

156
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,390
Right.

157
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,600
- This is the company.
 - Oh my.

158
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,860
I guess my navigation system has an error.

159
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,620
 Keep your word! 

160
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,730
- What are those people doing? 
 - Reopen it! Reopen it! 

161
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,260
 KM Financial, keep your promise! 

162
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,860
 Keep your promise! 

163
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,070
It seems like they're protesting. What might be the reason?

164
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,520
Resume the final round of the youth entrepreneur funding competition?

165
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,100
You've got to be kidding me. What is security doing?

166
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,680
In a democracy, they have the right to voice their opinion.

167
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,640
Why are you siding with them? You should side with your master.

168
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,820
A righteous robot sides with justice.

169
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,530
The social contribution team leader embezzled money.

170
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,690
By receiving a rebate from those who were trying to receive financial funding.

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Is this justice?

172
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,420
  
   

173
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,150
It's been a long time, Director Ye.

174
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,530
She must be your new secretary.

175
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,620
  
  
  
  

176
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,380
Dammit? Ah... The photo of the two kids.

177
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,580
He's her father?

178
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,910
Did you put any thought into investing in Geumho Steel?

179
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,800
I just buy and sell. I don't invest.

180
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,630
But there is always an exception and a variable.

181
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,250
For all the times you helped KM Financial as a shareholder,

182
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,130
thank you for that.

183
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,110
Geumho Steel has to choose between bankruptcy and sale.

184
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,240
Your late father was someone who expanded his company.

185
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,130
But it seems like you became someone who eats up other companies.

186
00:14:53,130 --> 00:15:01,880
No. I'm confident that my father would be relieved if he saw me right now.

187
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,210
Ri El is coming back tomorrow for good.

188
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,780
I see.

189
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:33,280
So... your father has passed away?

190
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,440
My mother, too.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,670
When?

192
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,290
Fifteen years ago. In a car accident.

193
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:54,660
♫  Someone like me  ♫

194
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:01,200
♫  Can someone like me do it?  ♫

195
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,150
♫  Am I really  ♫

196
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,420
Hey, Kim Min Kyu.

197
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,100
What?

198
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,450
Why is your face all wrinkled up? You want me to iron it for you?

199
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,180
♫  Taking a few steps back  ♫

200
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,770
Are you on friend mode again?

201
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,190
The weather's nice, too. So smile.

202
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,100
If you save your smiles, they turn into poop, too.

203
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,620
That's it, my friend.

204
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,750
Fine. I'm only laughing because I'm with you.

205
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,340
I don't laugh when I'm with others.

206
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,700
Why not?

207
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,410
I want to come off as scary.

208
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,120
Why?

209
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,330
So they won't dare to do anything to me.

210
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,160
Who is it?

211
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,680
Just who is it? Who is the person that dares to do something to you?

212
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,120
Tell them to come here and I'll take care of them all!

213
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,190
♫  These events  ♫

214
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,720
♫  so lovely  ♫

215
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,300
 AG-3, which one is coffee? 

216
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,450
 This is soy sauce. 

217
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,590
 This is hot chocolate. 

218
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,930
 This is coffee. 

219
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,660
 Good. 

220
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,490
 What is the headline today in the Science Magazine? 

221
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,410
 A viscoelastic material that has... 

222
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,920
This is a video of Santa Maria's robot development.

223
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,270
Daeyang Shipbuilding's Chairman Park Seong Jin, right before he died, met with the president

224
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,800
and showed him this video to ask for further funding.

225
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,960
Director Yeon, just what do you do at work?

226
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,950
If something like this happened, you should have told me immediately.

227
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,120
I'm sorry. Your father wanted to take some burden off of you.

228
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,430
Who knows about this?

229
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,600
It's just your father, you, and me.

230
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,940
What is the possibility of Kim Min Kyu knowing about this?

231
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,330
Speaking legally, Santa Maria belongs to KM Financial.

232
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:59,380
Kim Min Kyu has no reason to keep quiet if he knows about this because it's a good weapon to use against us.

233
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,020
- It works. It works.
 - Santa Maria!

234
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,750
- I told you I would fix it. It works!
 - Santa Maria.

235
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,390
- It works, it works.
 - This right here is the work of Santa Maria.

236
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,780
Yes, yes. You've worked hard.

237
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,820
The service people said that they would be here in a couple of days.

238
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,750
However, why do you need this type of machine at home?

239
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,770
It's for our master's safety.

240
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,750
 Don't even get me started. Sending leftover food is nothing. 

241
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,070
 There has been a time when he's been cut by shards of broken glass. 

242
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,570
 Once, an employee of a company that he sold sent him an ax. 

243
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,350
Why this—

244
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:49,600
 Then another time, people he had fired sent a voodoo doll. 

245
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,320
That...

246
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,260
was when we decided to get this machine.

247
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,900
If a box doesn't get approved by this machine, it can't come inside of the house no matter what it is.

248
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,840
Why do I feel so itchy?

249
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,200
Is something sprouting in my heart or what?

250
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,080
 Ri El is coming back tomorrow for good. 

251
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,270
I got on a taxi. Yes.

252
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,140
Don't tell him I'm here because I want to surprise him.

253
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,370
AG-3, stay here and don't move.

254
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,920
This time, too, you can't come outside no matter what.

255
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,570
Yes, Master.

256
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,710
Is someone here?

257
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,470
Ri El.

258
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,040
My first love.

259
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,800


260
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,040
How can this house still look the same after 15 years?

261
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,260
Whenever I come here, it feels like time has stopped.

262
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,460
It's been a long time, Kim Min Kyu.

263
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,330
It's been a long time... Ye Ri El.

264
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,910
How do I look? Don't you think I look more grown-up now?

265
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,230
Yeah.

266
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,510
  
  

267
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,490
A lot.

268
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,060
She has a lot of work experience.

269
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,720
I got appointed as the team leader of your company's social contribution team.

270
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,510
I guess it was you, the team leader that Yoo Cheol said he would bring.

271
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,640
However, I have another reason for coming back.

272
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,510
What do you think it is? Guess.

273
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,980
I'm not sure. What is it?

274
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,220
My father told me to marry you.

275
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,380
He's telling me to marry you for money. You know, right?

276
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,860
My answer was...

277
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,780
Why not?

278
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,390
Money? The more, the better. Your personality? I'm well aware.

279
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,860
It's better than getting betrayed by some random rich heir I don't know. Right?

280
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,650
Let's make a deal. Give me your money and reputation

281
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,230
and I'll promise to use my father's share for your company's benefit forever.

282
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,050
Although this is an arranged marriage,

283
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,100
we should try going on dates. Right?

284
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,060
Let's go on just 3 dates.

285
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,980
If I can confirm that I'm able to kiss you, then I'm down for this marriage.

286
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,080
What do you think?

287
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,390
- Are you all right?
 - I'm sorry.

288
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,320
I have an appointment to attend, so I'm going now. I'll call you later.

289
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,240
Master.

290
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,890
Are you okay, Master?

291
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,320
 If I change to the point that you cannot recognize me like how it happened just now, 

292
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,950
 go to that room I told you not to go in, and open the drawer. 

293
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,050
 There's going to be a syringe in the drawer. 

294
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,540
 Inject it into my skin as an emergency maneuver. 

295
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,260
♫  I, for a few days   ♫

296
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,970
 No matter how I change in my looks, 

297
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,490
 I hope you can still recognize me. 

298
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,730
♫  trying to breathe  ♫

299
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,860
♫  and trying to sleep are meaningless  ♫

300
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,840
♫  I want to say it  ♫

301
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,540
♫  I want to call it  ♫

302
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,660
♫  Can I put my lips   ♫

303
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:49,530
♫  these words from my heart   ♫

304
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:55,080
♫  No matter how   ♫

305
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,730
♫  You can't seem to see my heart  ♫

306
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,380
♫  Behind these red cheeks  ♫

307
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,790
♫  just how much tears I had to shed and erase  ♫

308
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,040
 I Am Not a Robot 

309
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,460
 Why did God leave so many of these 

310
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,090
  heart piercing memories with me? 

311
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,620
 Whether or not Baton is a pervert, he doesn't want to send Jo Ji Ah away. 

312
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,510
 I would like to properly introduce myself again. I'm Jo Ji Ah's older brother, Jo Jin Bae. 

313
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:33,020
 That man? When did the super psycho dine-and-dash jerk become 'that man' to you? Make a move on him then.   

314
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,380
 How adorable. Just look at how adorable you are.
