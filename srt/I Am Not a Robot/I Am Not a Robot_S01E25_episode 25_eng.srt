1
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,310
Phew!

2
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,160
I finally found you.

3
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:35,170


4
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,960
That...

5
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,060
That's...

6
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,340
That's the necklace I gave to AG-3.

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,120
I... I can explain everything.

8
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,510
All this time...

9
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,980
You were deceiving me?

10
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,960
I feel like throwing up.

11
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,930
What are we going to do?

12
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,010
What are we going to do? I'm so sorry. I'll explain everything.

13
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,710
What are we going to do?

14
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,600
What are we going to do?

15
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,210
- Connect the oxygen mask.
 - Okay.

16
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,120
- Check his oxygenation level.
 - I understand.

17
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,010
Did his blood vessels expand yet? Give him 0.3 units of epinephrine by IV.

18
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,190
- Give him all 500cc of fluid. Quickly. 
- Okay.

19
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,380
Insomnia... Grand mal seizures...

20
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,500
Hallucinations making him mistake a human for a robot.

21
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,280
What would a psychiatrist say about all of these?

22
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,120
Delirium?

23
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,660
Mental illness. That's what they said.

24
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,190
I already got the doctors' confirmations. Staying as a chairman isn't the problem.

25
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,120
He will be ruined socially.

26
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,960
   

27
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,640
Of course, I don't want to go that far.

28
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,890
That is if you show me a little bit of sincerity.

29
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,090
   

30
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,240
AG-3 never existed to begin with.

31
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,250
From the beginning, you used Jo Ji Ah, a human being,

32
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,670
to deceive Kim Min Kyu into thinking that she was AG-3.

33
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,680
Send the real AG-3 at the time of my choosing,

34
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,860
to the place I select.

35
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,440
Then she will be disappear forever.

36
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,770
I will be changing AG-3's face.

37
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,070
We will examine it first then change the face,

38
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,550
so don't even lay a finger on it.

39
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,240
   

40
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,610
Are you all right?

41
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,060
Patient Kim Min Kyu!

42
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,290
Patient Kim Min Kyu's awake now.

43
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,500
While he was unconscious, for some unknown reason his condition kept going back and forth in the extreme. So I was worried.

44
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,480
Now his condition has gotten a lot better and he's able to talk to people as long as there is no physical contact.

45
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,550
However, it will be too much for him to move yet. He needs more rest.

46
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,000
These are the affidavits and the incident reports from the people who were related to the testing of AG-3.

47
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,060
How and since when the Santa Maria Team's testing fraud began,

48
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,700
I received the affidavits relating to everything in their own handwriting.

49
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,990
Sue them all.

50
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,760
Yes, but if you make a lawsuit then there is a possibility that you will be dismissed.

51
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,600
Why don't you start by reading the summary of the incident reports that I wrote first?

52
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,470
What is the deep learning video?

53
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,470
Why is there a video clip of me?!!

54
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,810
From what I verified, AG-3's deep learning system that is currently being developed right now

55
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,840
is done by extracting the pattern from the video footage that was taken.

56
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,850
Even if it becomes a product that will be sold, the principle will stay the same.

57
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:08,510
However, opening the video clips without notifying you gives us the grounds to file a lawsuit.

58
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,400
To reclaim the video clip from President Hwang, Doctor Hong

59
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,590
signed a document claiming that everything regarding AG-3 was fake

60
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,390
and accepted the condition that he will hand over the real AG-3 without receiving anything in return.

61
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,650
Unless you're crazy, why would anyone sign that document!

62
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,150
He threatened them saying that if he doesn't sign the document, then he will release the info about your illness to the press.

63
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,430
So he did it for me?

64
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,810
You're asking me to believe that right now?

65
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:45,390
It's the truth. In addition, if you file a lawsuit then the fact that this test was a fraud will be known to the world.

66
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:51,750
Then you'll be dismissed for the same reason that CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol was dismissed.

67
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,210
I don't care so just go ahead and sue them. All of the Santa Maria team members,

68
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,590
including the woman that acted as a robot.

69
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,820
I will. I will gather the documents and proceed with the lawsuit.

70
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,460
   

71
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,680
   

72
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,650
And this is my resignation letter.

73
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,590
Currently I'm on the waiting list to be transferred internally within the company.

74
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,820
I wrote down the reason for resigning in the letter itself.

75
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,040
I will take care of all the work that I am assigned to until you find a replacement.

76
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:04,180
Now you are saying that the girl that acted as the robot is your younger sister, Team Leader Jo?

77
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,140
I deeply and truly apologize to you.

78
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,970
Get lost.

79
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,650
Oh, and please deliver this message

80
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:23,700
to all of them to not even delay for a second and just get the hell out of my house immediately!

81
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, I will do that.

82
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:42,450


83
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,620
Team Leader Jo.

84
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,470
Please come and drink some warm tea before you leave.

85
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,920
This is the tea that Chairman Kim Myung Hoon used to like before he passed away.

86
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,550
I used to recommend it to the young master a few times

87
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,770
but it doesn't seem to suit his taste buds.

88
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,270
Thank you.

89
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,910
Drink up please.

90
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,080
You're not running away, are you?

91
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,560
Pardon?

92
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,540
In the past, Chairman Kim Myung Hoon used to tell me this as he held onto me whenever I was going through a hard time.

93
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,240
He told me that you shouldn't run away when someone is going through a hard time.

94
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,780
I told him not to do it.

95
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,730
They were going to tell you the whole truth but I stopped them

96
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,890
because I was worried that something would happen to you and that you might die.

97
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,810
Because they felt the same way, nobody was able to say anything.

98
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,050
So? What does that have to do with me now?

99
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,150
Well...

100
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,700
When was that?

101
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,890
The day before the reset.

102
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:44,920
If those people honestly confessed to you that day, then how do you think you would have felt?

103
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,240
Do you think the joy of AG-3 being a human would've been bigger than your feelings of betrayal?

104
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm sleepy. Please leave. I can be alone now.

105
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,990
You should eat something before you fall asleep.

106
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,790
I'm not in the mood for it.

107
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,740
Please have a good rest.

108
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,210
Did Kim Min Kyu ask for me?

109
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,460
Then what about us?

110
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,900
Chairman Kim told me to deliver this message to you all.

111
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:58,700
He said that he doesn't want you to delay for even a second and get the hell out of his house right away.

112
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,640
That's an obvious decision he made.

113
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,060
Go ahead and pack for now.  We will take the computers and all of the machines once we find a place to store them.

114
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,280
What about AG-3?

115
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,520
We should take it with us since we have to send it to President Hwang when he calls for it.

116
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,340
By the way, where are we going to go for tonight?

117
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,280
How may I help you?

118
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,350
Doctor, what should I do? What can I do?

119
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:14,710
He was cured of his disease because of me but he is sick again because of me.

120
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,430
I will do everything and anything you tell and ask me to do. So what should I do now?

121
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:26,330
What can I do for him so that he can be cured again?

122
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:34,070
Miss Jo, I feel like you are the one with the answers, not me...

123
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,380
because you are the one who made this miracle happen.

124
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:47,260
I finally now think that if you do find an answer, whatever answer you find may be the right answer.

125
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,390
Auntie! Come and eat!

126
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,210
I don't want to eat right now.

127
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,840
Have a seat.

128
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,430
I really don't have the appetite to eat.

129
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,640
I made it so I can feed you so please have a little bit of it.

130
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,830
Auntie, it's super good. I bet you will eat the whole bowl.

131
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,280
Eat, eat.

132
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,900
- You should eat some, too. 
 - Yeah, eat up.

133
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,830
Please teach me how to cook.

134
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,360
Make the size a bit more consistent.

135
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,760
Slowly and gently.

136
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:17,380
Hold up. You should go from top to bottom. Yes, gently.

137
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,410
Be consistent with the size.

138
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,450
Slowly.

139
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,940
- Oh, no.
 - Dong Hyun please bring me the first aid kit.

140
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,080
Stay still. Oh my, what are we going to do?

141
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,110
Ouch, it hurts.

142
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,640
Give it to me.

143
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,920
Thank you.

144
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,100
Do you all have a place to stay?

145
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,790
You can come here during the day. I don't have any customers anyway.

146
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,710
You don't have customers at night either.

147
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,390
We're in the middle of looking for a studio or a warehouse with an office

148
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,160
since we can't go abroad once we get sued anyway.

149
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,750
Sue? Who will? Kim Min Kyu?

150
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,120
We deserve it anyway.

151
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,180
The deeper the love, the deeper the wound.

152
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,470
He must've liked all of you a lot more than I had expected.

153
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:34,380
Do you want someone with this illness for a son-in-law?

154
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,030
Just leave the future of KM Financial to Yoo Cheol and Ri El. Director Ye and I

155
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:47,170
can offer a dependable support to those two. Isn't that such a beautiful picture?

156
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,380
In order to do that, wouldn't you need someone to own the shares you bought under a borrowed name?

157
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,070
With their marriage, I will transfer them to Ri El.

158
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,690
What do you plan on doing with Kim Min Kyu?

159
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,370
Now that we are working together,

160
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,800
we can get rid of him whenever we need to.

161
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,450
Of course, until then let's keep his illness a secret between us.

162
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,950
Yoo Cheol and Ri El should only hear and see good news.

163
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,800
Butler Sung?

164
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,550
I brought you food. Since you can't eat food made by others,

165
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,160
I wore disposable gloves, a mask,

166
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,920
and made sure not a strand of hair fell in the food.

167
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,730
I made it very cleanly.

168
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,440
That's right. He is trying to endure through this.

169
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,230
Therefore, you have to hold on until the very end, too.

170
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,980
Aren't we going to see the warehouse to move in?

171
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,430
This is a school, Doctor.

172
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,080
I already talked to the professor.

173
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,910
He said that as long as you're okay with it, the full-time professorship is still available.

174
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,230
Go and see the professor.

175
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,550
I'm pretty sure I made myself clear that I'm not going to take that position.

176
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,390
Pi. I know it's hard, but accept it.

177
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:40,890
Hong Baek Gyun's career is over now. Santa Maria Team is also over.

178
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,550
You fit as a professor.

179
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,720
I'll recommend Hoktal and Ssanip to other labs soon and send them away.

180
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,560
Once I send AG-3 to President Hwang, I'm going to wrap things up.

181
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,450
We believe in you, Doctor. We still have a lot of ideas that we want to develop.

182
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,670
Our team started from nothing and came all the way here.

183
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,130
We can just rebuild again, Doctor.

184
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,660
I lived up until now believing that I could never be wrong,

185
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,780
but that belief is completely destroyed.

186
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,440
Now that I have started to think that I could be wrong,

187
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,250
everything seems scary. Everything.

188
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,060
You can only improve once you get over it.

189
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,030
Don't run away.

190
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,020
Can't you just leave, to allow my heart to feel more at ease?

191
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:28,910
♫  Standing here constantly staying by your side  ♫

192
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:36,150
♫  Standing here, what a foolish person  ♫

193
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,780
♫  Only if you turn your head  ♫

194
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,310
♫  You would see me  ♫

195
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,860
♫  Why don't you know?  ♫

196
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:54,700
♫  Then you shouldn't have smiled like that to me  ♫

197
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,850
Should we leave?

198
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,800
Go.

199
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,270
Okay.

200
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:12,120
♫  Heart-fluttering as we met each others' eyes  ♫

201
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,470
♫  You mean it didn't mean anything?  ♫

202
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:27,360
♫  Heart-fluttering a night without sleep  ♫

203
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,200
♫  Was all of it a novel that I wrote by myself?  ♫

204
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:43,000
♫  Standing here always on your side  ♫

205
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,170
♫  Standing here, what a foolish person  ♫

206
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:54,840
♫  Only if you turn your head  ♫

207
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:01,020
♫  I would be standing there you really don't know   ♫

208
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,300
♫  Then you shouldn't have smiled like that to me  ♫

209
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,640
Are you really crazy?

210
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,420
What's the reason for coming back when I completely and disrespectfully ignore you?

211
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,900
The lawsuit? Do you think that if you continue to be like this I will drop the lawsuit?

212
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,980
That's not it.

213
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,740
If that's not it, then why are you here? You're not a robot, so why are you in my house?!

214
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,240
You still can't fully understand what you did to me, right?

215
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,460
Should I show you?

216
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,000
What? In case it's contagious?

217
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,340
Or maybe because you're scared?

218
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,850
It's not that. Ever.

219
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,350
You weren't scared when you were a robot, but now that you're human, are you scared now?

220
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,720
You know that's not it.

221
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,680
- What's not it?! 
♫  I have been in pain for a few days  ♫

222
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,720
♫  Because my heart is overwhelmed by you  ♫

223
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,260
- This is my answer. Get lost. 
♫  Breathing and falling asleep   ♫

224
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,220
♫  are hard  ♫

225
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:28,960
♫  Even though I'm next to you, my heart can't be next to you  ♫

226
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,850
♫  I will always just long for you  ♫

227
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,620
 - I'm sorry!  
♫  And that longing  ♫

228
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:43,830
- However, I'm not one bit scared of you. 
♫  Has become tears again today  ♫

229
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,690
 - No matter  
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

230
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:53,360
 - what you say to me or how you show yourself to me, I will come back.  
♫  I want to call you  ♫

231
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,430
- Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, 
♫  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  ♫

232
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:03,470
- I will come back every day to see you. 
♫  Repeating over and over the words of my heart  ♫

233
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,440
♫  No matter how much I yell  ♫

234
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,040
♫  It doesn't seem like you can hear  ♫

235
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,560
♫  Every day, only in my heart and only with my eyes  ♫

236
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:30,910
♫  I could say the words of love for you  ♫

237
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,100
