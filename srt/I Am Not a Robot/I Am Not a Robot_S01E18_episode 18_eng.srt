1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,960
I love...

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,170
AG-3.

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,150
I don't want to accept this fact but I have no choice but to do so.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,770
So please tell me.

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,780
In planning for AG-3's deep learning,

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,290
was having this kind of result

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,040
a part of the plan?

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,040
Of course not.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,340
But...

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,990
Why am I being this way?

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,800
Now that I think about it, starting from some time ago

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,790
I used to always wait for the time when AG-3 came back.

13
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,750
When the evening came, I used to wish for the morning to come over and over like a chant.

14
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,600
I was so happy that there was someone out there that would listen to me

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,690
and look after me.

16
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,450
The fact that there was someone who remembered me

17
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,250
made me feel excited day after day.

18
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,630
But that's because you were alone for a very long time. What I mean is

19
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,300
because you made a friend for the first time.

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,690
She helped heal your disease so you just can't help but obsess over her without realizing it. That's what it is.

21
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,030
That's what I thought, too.

22
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,690
But...

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,620
whenever I am with AG-3,

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,880
I am alive.

25
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,240
That's how I feel.

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,200
Kim Min Kyu, snap out of it. AG-3 is a robot. She's a robot, you understand?

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,250
That's what I'm saying.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,000
But...

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,440
AG-3 also

30
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,220
seems to love me, too.

31
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,710
What nonsense are you talking about?

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,120
You know that's not possible. She talks and acts the way we program her.

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,600
And what you feel as her love is merely the end result of what you programmed into her, that's all!

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,180
That's why!

35
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,030
It still feels like that despite all of it and that's why I'm going crazy!

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,540
My head

37
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,190
tells me that all these things that I'm feeling

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,560
are fake, an illusion.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,970
But my heart tells me that all of these things

40
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,480
are real.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,060
Feeling this way really makes me feel like crap, you know that?!!

42
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,180
What should I do?

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,790
What do I need to do in order for me to take care of this situation?

44
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,520
Please tell me.

45
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,840
You should know.

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,650
Okay, okay. This way please. 
   

47
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,770
I wonder why he drank so much?

48
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,900
Here, here.

49
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,460
But how did you end up carrying him on your back?

50
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,530
Please take care of him.

51
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,570
- You really knew all about his disease, yet you still sent me over there? 
- What?

52
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,370
Did you still send me to that house even after you knew that Kim Min Kyu was allergic to humans?!

53
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,880
Doctor Oh just came by.

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,460
- Ji Ah, listen to me. 
- Oh, 50 billion won, huh?

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,100
The 50 billion won as additional research funds. That seems like a good reason.

56
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,470
What the Doctor did wasn't for the moneyâ€”

57
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,940
Pi, you be quiet.

58
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,160
Why did you do that to me?

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Ji Ah, you should scold me instead.

60
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,380
I'm the one to be blamed the most.

61
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,580
I was the one who broke AG-3 and that's why this happened.

62
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,480
That's not it, Ji Ah. It's all because I sent you that text message when I shouldn't have.

63
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,520
Those kids aren't at fault.

64
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,070
I made the call, so it's my responsibility.

65
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,210
Why did you make that call all on your own?!

66
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,290
You should've let me make a decision, too.

67
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,560
Fine, his disease is all cured and I'm really happy that I was able to heal him.

68
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,520
But I'm so scared!

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,180
If I possibly got caught,

70
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,910
then he could've died because of me.

71
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,950
You didn't think about that, did you?

72
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,160
I won't be able to explain myself to him now no matter which words I choose to use.

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,920
I won't be able to ask him to trust me again. Do you know what that means to me?

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,040
Why did you do that to me? Why?!

75
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,710
Ji Ah. Ji Ah!

76
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,160
The doctor genuinely wanted Chairman Kim to be cured from his disease.

77
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,260
That's why he abandoned his chance for other investment opportunities and decided to work with Chairman Kim instead.

78
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,490
We really thought that once we fixed AG-3 quickly and switch it back with you,

79
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,220
we thought that would be okay.

80
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,800
You should've told me exactly what you just said to me before.

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,800
Man, why isn't this AG-3 coming out already.

82
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,040
She's so pretty.

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,370
But there's something familiar about her. I'm sure I've seen her before somewhere.

84
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,840
Right? I'm sure I've seen her before as well.

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,660
- AG-3! 
 - AG-3!

86
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,700
- You're certain that's AG-3, right? 
- Yeah, I think she changed her wig.

87
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,650
No matter how many times you change your wig, you won't be able to escape from us.

88
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,800
- Follow her discreetly. 
 - Okay.

89
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,820
- What's this situation here?
 - Maybe the robot is running away?

90
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,030
What for? To this place?

91
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,080
Whose house is this?

92
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,410
That's Team Leader Jo Jin Bae from the investigation team.

93
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,490
So then that's Team Leader Jo's home?

94
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,980
Team Leader Jo Jin Bae.

95
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,100
Ji Ah's here.

96
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:06,280


97
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,040
Was it hard being away from home?

98
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,570
You should catch up on sleep and rest well.

99
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,460
Brother...

100
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,180
- Huh?
 - I should've listened to you then.

101
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,130
I should've tried to improve my resume and gotten a job.

102
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,060
If I had done that, I wouldn't be stuck in this mess right now.

103
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,070
Considering your age, you're not in a mess.

104
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,410
Not many people know what they like to do

105
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,200
and put their lives on the line for that dream.

106
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,480
I also wasn't able to live like that.

107
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,000
So what?

108
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,110
I ruined things for myself

109
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,000
and twisted up my life.

110
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,790
Fighting, Jo Ji Ah.

111
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:21,340
By any chance, do you really think AG-3 cured Kim Min Kyu?

112
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,060
As long as Kim Min Kyu thinks Jo Ji Ah is a robot,

113
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,920
the one he loves is AG-3.

114
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,890
At first, I was angry.

115
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,480
But I'm thankful because in the end, you were able to cure him.

116
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,380
However, what will you do about this side effect now?

117
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,660
Just how can we help him when he firmly believes that he's in love with a robot?

118
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,700
If those two can start over again from the beginning,

119
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,950
there may be hope.

120
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,000
Do you have enough courage to confess

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,310
that AG-3 wasn't actually a robot?

122
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,220
AG-3, go online with Kim Min Kyu's account.

123
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,810
Hello, Doctor.

124
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,260
AG-3, what is your relationship right now with Kim Min Kyu?

125
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,760
My master and I are in a relationship where we can share embarrassing facts without being embarrassed.

126
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,110
Even though we can be each other's closest friend, we can never be in a romantic relationship.

127
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,180
 I think AG-3... 

128
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,290
 also loves me. 

129
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,330
 Did you cut yourself? 

130
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,540
 How could you cook so aggressively like that? 

131
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,440
 This is the perfect moment to kiss. 

132
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,580
 Fold a finger if you wished that robot was actually a human. 

133
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,690
 I'm not a robot. 

134
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,770
â™«  Don't frown, everybody is going through a hard time.  â™«

135
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,920
â™«   You have friends who are with you   â™«

136
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,700
â™«   for your happy days.   â™«

137
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,190
-  Are you at home? 
 - Yeah.

138
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,930
Did you eat?

139
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,760
How can I eat when I could've accidentally killed someone?

140
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,900
I should not have

141
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,030
looked for you that day.

142
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,630
We can't blame anyone.

143
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,550
It was me who fell for â‚©10,000,000.

144
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,380
I should've told you the truth back then.

145
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,660
 Now what do you want me to do? 

146
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,480
 Turing Test. 

147
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,520
 By sending in a robot and a human that looks exactly the same at alternate times, 

148
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,780
 we're going to test who seems more human. 

149
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,870
 You're not deceiving anyone, but you must. 

150
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,110
 That's how you will help improve the advancement of robots. 

151
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,860
I am the crazy one for believing that it was a test.

152
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,690
Even though I felt something was off,

153
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,020
I didn't look into it more.

154
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,610
I just enjoyed...

155
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,700
Deciding to stay even though I had the chance to leave,

156
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,300
I didn't do that just because I wanted to help Kim Min Kyu.

157
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,520
A new deep-learning method

158
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,150
and the fact that a robot made by me was curing someone

159
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,450
 made me very happy. 

160
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,310
 Therefore, I wanted to see the end result of the test. 

161
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,050
In the process,

162
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,340
I didn't look at the fact that

163
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,710
Kim Min Kyu could've gotten hurt.

164
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:16,460
Therefore, I think it's best to be honest before it's too late.

165
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,760
That's right.

166
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,720
Let's go tell him everything tomorrow.

167
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,790
Hi... AG-3.

168
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,740
I love you, Master.

169
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,250
What is it that you want?

170
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:29,060


171
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,770
Did you call me, Master?

172
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,810
I have compiled a list of dresses for Ye Ri El to wear.

173
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,230
AG-3,

174
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:54,300
looking at you...

175
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,670
is too hard for me.

176
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,940
Did I do something wrong?

177
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,760
When I look at you,

178
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,530
I get reminded of

179
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,710
what I can't do with you.

180
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,020
What is it that you can't do with me?

181
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,600
I can

182
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,840
do anything now.

183
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,600
That's why I have a lot of things I want to do with you.

184
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:51,110
I can't watch you grow old.

185
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,800
I can't cook for you.

186
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,180
I can't hug you.

187
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,670
You're still the same,

188
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,550
but I've... I've changed.

189
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,130
My feelings have grown so much

190
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,620
that I'm not confident

191
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,000
that I can handle this for the rest of my life.

192
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,290
You were the one that said you wanted to stay together forever.

193
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,610
I'm sorry.

194
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,140
However, it looks like you are being punished.

195
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,730
You look very hurt and sad.

196
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:00,980
You master is in a mess, right?

197
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,960
No matter what you look like, you're still my master.

198
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,790
Let's go.

199
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,820
They're leaving. They're leaving.

200
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,650
Isn't that Doctor Hong Baek Gyun?

201
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:55,420
So he picks up AG-3 from Jo Jin Bae's house. Why is that?

202
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,980
Our work has become easier. We just need to raid that tiny apartment.

203
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,900
He's quick-witted. It's Director Yoon.

204
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,700
Yes, Director Yoon, I was about to report to youâ€”

205
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,590
 What about AG-3? Did you kidnap it? 

206
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,220
Ah, about that. Not yet. However, we have an incredibleâ€”

207
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,660
 You guys are worse than amateurs. You guys are fired. 

208
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,520
E-Excuse me. What I saw was, here at Team Leader Jo's house, the robot goes to and comes back from work.

209
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,500
So AG-3 is going to work and coming back from workâ€”

210
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,070
Hello? Director Yoon? Director Yoon?

211
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,390
What did he say?

212
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,390
We're fired.

213
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,640
- Set a fire?
 - Fired. We're fired.

214
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,330
We just got fired. Why can't you understand?

215
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,500
 He died from an allergy shock. 

216
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,040
 There was nothing we could do. 

217
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,790
Tilda Morton took off with all of Johnny's assets.

218
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,160
Everything around her was a lie.

219
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,850
 Johnny died from an allergy shock. 

220
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,500
â™«  Don't frown  â™«

221
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,520
â™«  Everybody-  â™«

222
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,500
Yes, hello?

223
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,030
Johnny Brown died. Are you listening to me? You can't tell him.

224
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,830
 Tilda conned him and left. He died from an allergy shock because of her. 

225
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:25,340
 We do not know what will happen if Kim Min Kyu finds out that you aren't a robot and that everything was a lie. 

226
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,930
Therefore, we must not say a thing.

227
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,620
You must never cross paths with Kim Min Kyu!

228
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,440
It looks like

229
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,540
it will snow today.

230
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,890
It sure does.

231
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,910
I'll tell you what you need to do today.

232
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,350
Let's reset AG-3.

233
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,870
Until now, you must have been saddened when you received my frequent scoldings.

234
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:29,720
Okay, today I will give you a huge compliment. Listen well, AG-3.

235
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,490
For the last month, you were my friend,

236
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,210
my treasure, and my cure.

237
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:52,060
Also, you were a door to step outside into the world.

238
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:04,450
Every moment with you was like a miracle to me. Thank you.

239
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:12,370
Also, I'm sorry.

240
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,750
â™«  I have been in pain for a few days  â™«

241
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,210
I wasn't the one that cured you.

242
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,220
The longing for someone you still had in your heart

243
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,080
cured you.

244
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,880
Without me, you would've still been cured one day.

245
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,390
So now, whatever you do, make sure you're happy

246
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,050
and have fun.

247
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,420
â™«  Has become tears again today 

248
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,970
I'll also give you a huge compliment, so listen well.

249
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,940
â™«  I want to tell you  â™«

250
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,350
You...

251
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,550
are someone that made me realize that I'm valuable.

252
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,160
â™«  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  â™«

253
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:18,580
You were my friend, treated me like a treasure,

254
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,130
and allowed me to walk on a flowery path.

255
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,110
â™«  It doesn't seem like you can hear  â™«

256
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,810
Everything you did for me,

257
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,030
â™«  Every day,  â™«

258
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,870
I won't forget those feelings and will remember them forever.

259
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,820
â™«  I could say the words of love for you  â™«

260
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,430
Thank you.

261
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,230
And I'm sorry.

262
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,990
AG-3. Operation mode.

263
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,900
How can I help you, Master?

264
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:16,590
I will now reset you.

265
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:24,850
If I get reset, every memory I had with you will be deleted and

266
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,440
can't be restored.

267
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,000
Would you still like to continue?

268
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,490
Continue.

269
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,420
Please press the button at the back of my neck for five seconds,

270
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,200
then I will proceed with the reset.

271
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:58,460
For one last time, I have something to input.

272
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,850
Those words, too, will be deleted.

273
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,680
â™«  I want to tell you  â™«

274
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,360
â™«  I want to let you hear  â™«

275
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,590
â™«  Lingering right at the edge of my lips  â™«

276
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:31,500
â™«  Repeating over and over the words of my heart  â™«

277
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,700
â™«  No matter how much I yell  â™«

278
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,290
I love you.

279
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,590
â™«  It doesn't seem like you can hear  â™«

280
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,630
â™«  Every day, only in my heart  â™«

281
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,220
The time I spent with you, Master,

282
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,000
every moment was happiness.

283
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,560
â™«  The words of love for you  â™«

284
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,800


285
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,080


286
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,120
â™«  All day today too you are lingering in my thoughts  â™«

287
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,740
â™«  I only wait for the time when I can see you  â™«

288
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,930
â™«  When I see you, I get cowardly  â™«

289
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,990
â™«  I want to know your heart  â™«

290
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,590
â™«  I've been waiting for so long  â™«

291
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,560
â™«  For the moment I meet you  â™«

292
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,680
â™«  Will you understand me? Will you see me?  â™«

293
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,560
â™«  My heart that worries  â™«
