1
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,900
- I'm so full. 
- We ate too much, huh?

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,050
- I have to go on a diet though. 
- You always say that.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,090
You just need to do what you've always done, Jo Ji Ah.

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,220
No more and no less.

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,650
Just like you have always done.

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,340
The final screening for the Young Entrepreneurs Competition is going on today.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,610
I heard that the Baton revived it.

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,840
By the Baton, you mean... Kim Min Kyu?

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,020
You know how Ye Ri El, the new Social Contribution team leader, is in charge of this event?

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,890
I heard that Baton approved it to  boost Team Leader Ye's confidence.

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,460
There's a rumor that they're going to get married.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,680
She's the only daughter of Director Ye Sung Tae.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,290
But why is she marrying the Baton?

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,550
There's also the president's son, CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol.

15
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,380
The three of them have been friends since childhood.

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,070
Isn't CEO Hwang superior in every way?

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,640
But he is good looking. And he's rich.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,990
He's the chairman, the boss of bosses in our company.

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,310
What good is that?

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,670
He has absolutely no manners and is a crazy psycho.

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,020
CEO Hwang is awesome.

22
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,980
Oh my goodness!

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,570


24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,190
What is that?

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,040
I know.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,410
Kim Min Kyu is superior in every way.

27
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,740
I can't connect to the wi-fi.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,960
What should I do? I need to connect the heart balls to wi-fi.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,040
Excuse me. I'm sorry but could you tell me the wi-fi password?

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,500
The wi-fi password?

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,980
It's km123456.

32
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,270
Thank you.

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,090
Just a sec.

34
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,840
Aren't you here for the final screening of Young Entrepreneurs Competition?

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,610
- Yes. 
- The judging is that way.

36
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,580
Thank you.

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,510
He's dense. Really dense.

38
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,100
I've seen that suitcase before.

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,350
I will explain the rules for the competition.

40
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,740
Once you set up your business items in these flea market styled booths,

41
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,430
our employees and judges

42
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,700
will peruse your items on their own.

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,260
During this time, freely and confidently explain your item.

44
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,340
Every one of them will become your precious votes.

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,060
There is no separate interview. The final winner will be chosen

46
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,910
based on the employee's votes which are worth 50% and the judges' marks which are the other 50%.

47
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,800
And the result will be announced in a few days.

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,910
 Perhaps, you're already 

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,060
 that one person to someone. 

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,270
 I've put what my dad has said into this heart ball. 

51
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,790
 If you touch this heart ball, 

52
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,010
 you're going to be reminded of that one person you want to deliver your feelings to. 

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,840
 If you resume the final round, 

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,990
 I want to give this heart ball to you, 

55
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,350
 wishing that someday 

56
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,850
 that one person will appear before you. 

57
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,880
I'm going to the final round. Empty the second lobby.

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,020
I was scheduled to show you the research lab site today, but I have to postpone.

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,580
The chairman suddenly said that he's coming to work.

60
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,550
- Can you go a little bit faster, please? 
- Okay.

61
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,390
I have to block Kim Min Kyu.

62
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,450
He can't run into Ji Ah.

63
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,720
If by any chance she is caught, today's final screening will...

64
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,570
  This year, there were lots of items that showed their uniqueness  

65
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,270
  and also reflected the current trends.  

66
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,430
  In response, we will be responsible  

67
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,410
  and will work hard to judge fairly.  

68
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,030
In addition, especially starting this year,

69
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,500
the CEO of KM Financial will be one of the judges.

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,550
He will be the one who will reward 100 million won to the winner.

71
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,450
Please welcome him with a round of applause.

72
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,720
   

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,230
Nowadays, one out of ten young adults

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,670
has dreams of starting their own business.

75
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,890
Out of those people, in reality

76
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,540
only 19.9% of them last more than five years.

77
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,840
So we, KM Financial,

78
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,190
will not stop at temporary rewards, but will continue to supervise and

79
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,790
provide a management system

80
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,080
to support the dreams of young adults.

81
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,650
Thank you.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,340
Chairman.

83
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,450
   

84
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,300
Why is that there? It's definitely Ji Ah's.

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,230
 Excuse me. I'm sorry but could you tell me the wi-fi password? 

86
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,740
Then...

87
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,030
that crazy hair woman was my sister Jo Ji Ah?

88
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,030
She'll be fine, right?

89
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,120
What if she's stuttering because she's frozen?

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,980
Other booths will be full of people yet Ji Ah's booth will be empty... is not what will happen.

91
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,990
   

92
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,060
Today's luck isn't that good.

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,340
Hello, please take a look at our veils!

94
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,200
We handmade them.

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,740
Hello. Welcome.

96
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,010
This all-purpose grill is unlike any other.

97
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,170
Do you ever feel like you're alone in this world?

98
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,700
   

99
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,450
When phone calls,

100
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,830
messages, and e-mails don't cheer you up,

101
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,890
touch this heart ball. Then...

102
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,910
What is she saying?

103
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,350
It's not that useful. We have phones.

104
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,210
What's that? It's so childish.

105
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,170
How did it come to the final round?

106
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,590
- Did someone support her? 
- I guess.

107
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,970
Why did she make this kind of thing?

108
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,770
You should speak up loudly. What are you doing?

109
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,870
You have a loud voice when you fight with me.

110
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,850
Why are you sitting dejectedly? You have strong legs.

111
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,740
   

112
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,440
How could you come here? No, why did you come here?

113
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,040
- Did Kim Min Kyu notice Ji Ah? 
- He can't.

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,490
She's wearing some wig like a crazy woman.

115
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,750
She did all sorts of things to hide from me.

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,140
- That's a relief. 
 - How did you know it was Ji Ah's final round?

117
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,080
By chance, are you dating my sister again?

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,860
I want to...

119
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,910
get back together with her.

120
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,030
- Does Ji Ah know? 
 - I'm about to tell her.

121
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,980
Is she doing well?

122
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,030
She's trying her best.

123
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,630
But Ji Ah has something stronger than luck.

124
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,630
What... some kind of a dependable supporter?

125
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,910
- What is it? 
- The inheritance from her father,

126
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,390
which no one can steal from her. 
   

127
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,890
What is this?

128
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,130
She wrote the letter so confidently.

129
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,290
 Ji Ah, my daughter whom I love. 

130
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,290
 Dad sees cars well  

131
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,680
 but our Ji Ah sees people well. 

132
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,420
 I... 

133
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,810
 see people well? 

134
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,340
  Just like how Dad fixes cars well, 

135
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,810
 our Ji Ah will surely become someone who is definitely needed by others, right? 

136
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,600
 You can do it.  

137
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,060
 I believe in you.   

138
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,550
 Dad.   

139
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,120
Do you have someone you love?

140
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,230
Do you have someone you want to comfort?

141
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,100
No matter where you are in the world,

142
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,460
with this heart ball, you can send your love to that person.

143
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,230
You can send them your heart without that person knowing.

144
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,860
- No matter where you are in the world, the light will turn on?
 - Yes, that is correct.

145
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,210
I have to go on a business trip next week to the US.

146
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,730
- If I begin to miss my daughter in the US and touch this... 
- Right at that moment,

147
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,920
your daughter's light in Korea will turn on.

148
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
- Even in Europe?
 - Even in Africa.

149
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,900
Wow, I really want to send this to my son who is studying abroad in New Zealand.

150
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,810
He's having a hard time adjusting,

151
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,750
- so he calls me every night crying because he misses me. 
- It's perfect for that!

152
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,400
When the heart turns on, your son

153
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,550
will know that his dad really misses him

154
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,650
right away, so how dependable and great is that?

155
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,820
There's no need for words.

156
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,810
I hope this comes out as a product.

157
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,960
Yes! Hey, look at this.

158
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,840
Gosh, this is... Look at it.

159
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,700
This is called a heart ball. It sends your heart to people.

160
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,080
- So if I touch it? 
- Right!

161
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,690
You just have to touch it.

162
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,710
Sending your heart to others...

163
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,300
 - Wow. 
- Hey, hey. Come take a look. 

164
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,470
 This is called a heart ball. 

165
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,730
I have no idea if people know this

166
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,910
but that heart ball is based on quantum physics.

167
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,960
My sister did that?

168
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,730
She fundamentally knows that law through her heart, not her mind.

169
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,310
She is more of a genius than I am in some ways.

170
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,480
My sister is?

171
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,670
So please do not underestimate Jo Ji Ah from now on.

172
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,070
- When did I do that? 
- I was the one who did that.

173
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,040
I never noticed that side of her properly in the past.

174
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,940
That's what I did wrong to Ji Ah four years ago.

175
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,060
I'm pretty sure you did that same thing.

176
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,330
Ji Ah used to always say... that Team Leader and I

177
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,500
resemble each other.

178
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,850
Good luck on the competition.

179
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,050
Thank you.

180
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,860
- Hello, Mr. CEO.  
- Yes, hello there. What's your name?

181
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,620
- Her name is Mink.
 - Her name is Mink, too.

182
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,920
The puppy you used to have was also called Mink, remember?

183
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,150
You still remember that?

184
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,740
Of course, I do.

185
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,590
You cried a lot when she died.

186
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,090
You didn't even go to school for a few days because of it.

187
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,970
   

188
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,970


189
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,870
- Team Leader. 
 - Yes?

190
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,940
I think you need to come with me, please.

191
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,810
- Sure. I'll be back in a bit. 
 - Okay.

192
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,380
Thanks for your hard work ahead of time.

193
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,230
- I will vote for you. 
- Thank you.

194
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,650
I observed earlier that you seem to be popular among our employees.

195
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,590
I think you can look forward to the employee votes.

196
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,030
Ah, yes. Thank you.

197
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,810
- Please do your best till the end. 
- I will.

198
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,990
One person?

199
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,770
And what if that one person becomes someone who gave you the most pain?

200
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,400
I bet you will probably think of the pain from that day whenever you look at this.

201
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,150
What do you do then?

202
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,450
Then do you just throw it away?

203
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,350
Or do you completely destroy it?

204
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,170
 Make sure to input this in your head. 

205
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,430
 Those two men are the primary enemies of your master. 

206
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,990
 Out of my enemies, they're the main ones. 

207
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,680
 Humans were doubly stabbing me in the back in my dream. 

208
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,600
Hey! Why would you hang out with a jerk that gives you a hard time?

209
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,060
You can make a new friend instead.

210
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,980
When I came home after being hurt by some jerk when I was younger,

211
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,700
that's what my father told me.

212
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:01,230
That like a river, people need to flow from one person to another, meeting all sorts of people.

213
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,040
Your father is definitely my type of guy it seems.

214
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,690
I really would love to meet your father and listen to his lecture someday.

215
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,440
He passed away.

216
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,090
My father passed when I was in high school and my mom passed when I was two years old.

217
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,800
I didn't ask you about that though.

218
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,590
I wanted to tell you that anyway.

219
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,920
Your personality is very similar to a certain someone I know.

220
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,270
When you touch this heart ball, you'll be reminded of a certain person.

221
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,860
What if it doesn't?

222
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,430
It will.

223
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,080
You will certainly be reminded of a person.

224
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,790
I like that confidence of yours!

225
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,730
Take that and go over to the front, please.

226
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,310
More. Back up more. Even more.

227
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:34,280
♫  Loving with all of your heart  ♫

228
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:42,660
♫  How and what kind of person can do it?  ♫

229
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:49,860
♫  It really doesn't work out well for me even though I try  ♫

230
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:58,830
♫  Like you before, I want to love like that  ♫

231
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,500
 I realized after I broke up with her. 

232
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,520
I thought I knew everything about Ji Ah.

233
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,280
But in reality, I knew nothing about her.

234
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,990
And I think that's why I made AG-3's face into Ji Ah's.

235
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,730
It was because I was curious to know more about Ji Ah.

236
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,770
I don't want to make stupid mistakes like this again.

237
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,150
I want to get to know Ji Ah properly starting from now on.

238
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,940
And I also want to see her properly as well.

239
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,760
And don't worry about AG-3's face.

240
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,960
As soon as Chairman Kim's test is done we are going to change it right away.

241
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,450
Please help me.

242
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,380
This is between you two.

243
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,190
I will be intervening when my little sister is crying again.

244
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,070
I'll keep that in mind.

245
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,270
Take care of today's issue without Chairman Kim knowing about it.

246
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,680
Between Chairman Kim Min Kyu and the Santa Maria Team,

247
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,810
don't make any incidents that can cause a misunderstanding is what I'm trying to say.

248
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,870
What do you mean by that...?

249
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,930
Chairman Kim Min Kyu is fighting all by himself right now.

250
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,580
President Hwang Do Won and CEO Hwang Yoo Cheol are trying to sell Santa Maria to Bold Group,

251
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,000
and against them, he is fighting alone.

252
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,350
Welcome! How much gas should I put in?

253
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,880
Fill her up.

254
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,290
I will help you with your payment right away.

255
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,230
Wow! I will make the transactions right away!

256
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,680
Here's your card and receipt. Thank you so much.

257
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,990
- Thank you, Ji Ah. 
- Thanks to all of you as well.

258
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,490
Thanks for the good work!

259
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,140
You did well, Jo Ji Ah.

260
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm proud of you.

261
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,490
I guess it's really all over.

262
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,770
It's over with him as well.

263
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,330
Don't come any closer!

264
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,170
- Take him away.
Hey! I'm allergic to dog fur! Take that dog away!

265
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,880
 Get away, get away from me! Let go! Let go! I told you to let go of me! 

266
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,330
  It's an allergy where I can't come in contact with human beings! 

267
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,550
 We should try going on dates, right? 

268
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,490
If he really has an allergic reaction to humans...

269
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,030
Then how am I supposed to explain that?

270
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,680
 There has been a case where someone got better when he found someone he could fully trust. 

271
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,460
 It was because of you. 

272
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,050
 It was because you were by my side. 

273
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,920
 And from now on, whenever I'm meeting someone, stay where I can see you. 

274
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,400
 I can't be without you. 

275
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,520
 Now you are my most precious treasure in the world. 

276
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,930
Could it be...?

277
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,330
So I was that kind of an existence?

278
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,580
Is that why he said that I was very valuable?

279
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh my.

280
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,850
- Are you all right?
 - Yes, I am.

281
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,540
- I'm sorry. Thank you so much. 
- No problem.

282
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,980
For the past fifteen years,

283
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,900
you really worked hard.

284
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,480
Because your stats were so low, I did have my hopes up but how could you, suddenly, today...

285
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,360
Did perhaps something psychologically good happen to you?

286
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,530
I called for someone in my heart.

287
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,880
Are you talking about your first love that you want to marry? Do you like her that much?

288
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,780
Now you can marry her, so how great is this! AG-3 has done a great thing.

289
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,320
Ah, that's right. You can send AG-3 back now. Since you're still able to be around people without her.

290
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,510
What if I want to continue to have her around me like right now?

291
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,760
Nonsense.

292
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,830
I can't?

293
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,100
You're going to marry someone.

294
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,920
What type of women will be okay with a robot that looks  like a human girl sticking around their husband?

295
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,300
They will feel taken back and leave.

296
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,730
You're only like this because you've gotten attached to it.

297
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:35,010
I can see why, Patient— I mean, Kim Min Kyu... Isn't this the first friend you made in 15 years?

298
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,830
Do you remember how happy you were before when you found out a robot liked you?

299
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,500
Imagine receiving that same type of emotion from a human. Just how happy would you be?

300
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,710
AG-3 also... made me very happy, Doctor.

301
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,560
That was all fake, an illusion.

302
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,370
Do you know what a happy occasion it is to meet your other half?

303
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,580
Receiving unconditional love from someone who is a complete stranger to you.

304
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,410
Being able to freely give what you have to the stranger.

305
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,820
Watching each other grow old together.

306
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,610
I really hope you get to experience that type of happiness.

307
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,330
Only people who are truly in love can experience it.

308
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,140
Do you know that when you feel that you're alive?

309
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,590
When you love someone. When you touch and hug your loved one.

310
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:27,770
I really hope you get to experience it wholly with your whole body and mind.

311
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,540
Until yesterday, you were practicing how to interact with others through a robot.

312
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,980
AG-3 opened the door of the place you were trapped in.

313
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,300
So now you should come out into this world and be among people.

314
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,090
Since you don't have an appointment, you will have to wait.

315
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,420
Okay, I'll wait.

316
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,560
Then, I'll put you on the list.

317
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,740
Yes. Thank you.

318
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,620
♫  Don't frown  ♫

319
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,200
♫  Everybody has someone there for them  ♫

320
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,680
What is it?

321
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Is the final round not over yet?

322
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,070
It's over already.

323
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,180
- Where are you right now?
 - I just came somewhere for a bit.

324
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,570
After you're done, call me. I have something to tell you.

325
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,970
- Here you go. 
- Yes.

326
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,860
Thank you.

327
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,010
 That was all fake, an illusion. 

328
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,250
 Until yesterday, you were practicing how to interact with others through a robot. 

329
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,660
 AG-3 opened the door of the place you were trapped in. 

330
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:06,050
 So now you should come out into this world and be among people. 

331
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
Please help me, Hyung.

332
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,320
Okay. Where are you feeling unwell?

333
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,910
Oh, you came a couple of days ago. Why? Did her condition get worse?

334
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,140
No. I'm not here today because of my niece.

335
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,360
I'm here because I have more questions about human allergy which I've asked you about.

336
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,390
Yes, ask me.

337
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,820
You told me this...

338
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,660
If they find someone they can trust and depend on, their condition can get better.

339
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,530
What does that mean exactly?

340
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,780
Let me show you a video. You'll be able to understand better.

341
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,570
 Hi, I'm Johnny Brown. 

342
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,520
 I got human allergy about 8 years ago. 

343
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,510
 Since then, I've lived alone. 

344
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,010
 My condition was so bad that I couldn't even be in the same space as other people. 

345
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,770
Johnny uploaded this video to help others understand his condition.

346
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,020
Tilda was his nurse who later became his girlfriend.

347
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,330
Soon after, his condition got better.

348
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,450
To Johnny, Tilda was the cure for him.

349
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,330
 I'll get over this disease, and I'll be able to experience the world with Tilda. 

350
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:48,080
♫  I have been in pain for a few days  ♫

351
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,690
♫  Because my heart is overwhelmed by you  ♫

352
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,160
For a long time,

353
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,450
how scared he must have been.

354
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,140
 The amount of time it took me to build that card castle is 15 years. 

355
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:13,220
 The one that I first built with my father when I was a kid, I built upon it by myself until now. 

356
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,950
How lonely he must have been?

357
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:24,470
♫  Has become tears again today  ♫

358
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,400
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

359
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,710
 How... 

360
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,460
♫  I want to call you  ♫

361
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,860
much he must have missed people.

362
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,210
That's why when someone like Tilda appeared, just how happy he must have been?

363
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,770
♫  The words of my heart  ♫

364
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm sure Tilda was also happy.

365
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,880
No one else but

366
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,360
she was able to cure her loved one.

367
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,890
♫  Every day, only in my heart  ♫

368
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:07,310
By any chance, Doctor...

369
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:14,090
Is it possible that the cure isn't a human being?

370
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,340
For example,

371
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:25,520
what if she was an object that looks like a human or a robot?

372
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,770
Then does it mean the robot is the cure?

373
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,220
By any chance, do you know Doctor Hong Baek Gyun?

374
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,460
You're here?

375
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,820
What's with those flowers?

376
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,680
Is it perhaps... mine?

377
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,230
Do you think they would be yours?

378
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,870
Give them to me. I'll accept them.

379
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,920
Sorry. I can't give these to you.

380
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,130
You're being shy.

381
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,620
What is it?

382
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,280
What is the meaning behind that smile?

383
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,760
You must be extremely thankful for me, right?

384
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,050
You're so thankful that you're shy right now.

385
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,190
Stop talking about being shy and just drink your beer.

386
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,980
- Give me the same as his. 
- Yes.

387
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,380
Copycat.

388
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,190
- Give me a bigger one than his. 
- Okay.

389
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,120
- Here you go.
- Yes.

390
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,530
Congratulations on your full recovery, Kim Min Kyu.

391
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,990
It's Ji Ah. Ji Ah, Ji Ah, it's our Ji Ah.

392
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,790
How was the competition? Did you do well?

393
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,270
She probably did well since she prepared for it so much.

394
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:25,570
However, what's wrong with your facial expression? Did you perhaps mess up?

395
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,610
Who are you?

396
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,400
Who are you?

397
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,460
Excuse me. Hey.

398
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,360
Oh my gosh.

399
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,270
Who are you?!

400
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,020
What is this, Ji Ah?

401
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,380
Unnie, did you know about it all along?

402
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,200
Oppas, did you guys know about it, too?

403
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,480
Wait a minute, Ji Ah. What are you talking about?

404
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,560
Just what could it be about?

405
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,220
I told you to send a robot, not a human!

406
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,450
Do you know what you have done?!

407
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,840
In a blink of an eye, you could've killed someone!!

408
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,090
Where is Doctor Hong Baek Gyun right now?

409
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,890
You should drink some more.

410
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,290
I already drank a lot. Tell me, what is it?

411
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,840
You told me this, remember?

412
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,640
You need to train a robot

413
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:00,340
to share emotions and to input emotions.

414
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,280
That's right.

415
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,190
I did everything you told me to.

416
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,190
Then your disease disappeared completely.

417
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,800
I've come to love someone.

418
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,140
What did you say?

419
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,720
I love...
