1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,960
It's worrisome from the start. Worrisome!

2
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,080
Alpha Team, we've secured the location.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,330
 Sending Wi-Fi signal. 

4
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,540
Alpha Team? You didn't even check for her cellphone, so who says that's your team name?

5
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,720
We're on two teams today though.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,940
Now, everyone get ready.

7
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,560
Hi, AG-3.

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,770
I love you, Master. What can I...

9
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,150
Oh my. Shit!

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,770
What is it?

11
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,360
Sunbae Pi.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,150
It wasn't me.

13
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,620
Oh my god.

14
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,910
 That face is definitely that dine-and-dash jerk! 

15
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,760
 Why is that guy here? 

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,380
 Then... this is that guy's house? 

17
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,190
 Wait. What did I say just now? 

18
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,120
 What to do? Did I get caught? 

19
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,880
   

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,130
Hey, tell him I died.

21
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,530
Tell him I became dust due to the Big Bang.

22
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,710
- Yes. 
 - No.

23
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,260
Yes, Chairman.

24
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,720
Not "I love you, Master" but

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,450
"Oh my. Shit!" is what this robot said.

26
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,470
This thing, did it just cuss at me?

27
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,340
Ah... well...

28
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,550
What happened was...

29
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,700
That is...

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,130
   

31
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,250
She was on friend mode. Yes, friend mode.

32
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,770
AG-3 has an operation mode and a friend mode.

33
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,360
An error must have occurred that she was suddenly set to friend mode.

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,280
Friend mode?

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,680
And also it seems like she learned some cuss words from the researchers during training,

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,440
 unbeknownst to me. 

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,600
Behind her neck, there's a power button. Using it, turn her off then on.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,280
Then she will operate properly.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,370
Yes, then.

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,400
You heard that, right?

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,550
 Please do this right. Please! 

42
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,810
It's ruined. We're ruined.

43
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,600
Unless he's an idiot, why would he believe that?

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,570
And they say his IQ is 159.

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,230
Friend mode? How dare you...

46
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,680
Do you think I would consent the likes of you to be my friend?

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,800
 Why, I should just tackle him down and forget about this part-time job! 

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,820
 Ten million won. Ten million won. 

49
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,320
 Just wait till this job is over. Hong Baek Gyun, you mold! I will kill you! 

50
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,050
Hi, AG-3.

51
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,820
I love you, Master. What would you like?

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,140
I love you, Master. What would you like?

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,030
So switching it off and on works.

54
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,950
He said it was a robot with artificial intelligence, but it's like any other household appliance.

55
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,260
AG-3, the fact that you are an artificial intelligence robot,

56
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,250
how can you prove that?

57
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,030
Master, how can you prove you are human?

58
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,450
Master, how can you prove you are human?

59
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:21,440
Good answer, but operation mode error.

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,260
Point deduction from the start.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
So he believes that? Unbelievable.

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,720
He's already seen AG-3's mechanical body,

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,820
so he can't imagine at all that what exists before him is human.

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,650
It's because his affirmation is so deep that he can't see the truth.

65
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,650
Invisible Gorilla Syndrome. 
   

66
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,230
Doctor, there's an input error.

67
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,910
It's because Ji Ah didn't reply using the caption in the beginning.

68
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,730
AG-3 got startled since then.

69
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,580
Pi, put Jo Ji Ah's reply as a priority value.

70
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,050
Yes.

71
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,990
Now, there shouldn't be any major issues to pass the test.

72
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,560
Yes. Unless we lose power.

73
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,590
No.

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,760
 What the? 

75
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,980
 What's wrong? Why did this suddenly go dead? 

76
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,920
AG-3.

77
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,250
Let's test your hardware now.

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,430
 What? Am I an orphaned duck right now?  

79
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,050
 What do I do? What do I say in reply? 

80
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,320
Yes, Master.

81
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,990
Sit.

82
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,510
Get up.

83
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,660
Lift your right foot.

84
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,590
Lift your right foot while you lift your left hand.

85
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,640
Lift your right hand. Lift your left hand twice then lift your left hand again.

86
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,780
Left hand twice then left hand again.

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,420
You...

88
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,360
disappoint me the more we go at it.

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,590
Minus 2 points.

90
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,710
Next.

91
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,030
Jo Ji Ah seems to be pretty gutsy.

92
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm sure Jo Ji Ah will do well.

93
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,490
Her IQ score is 94.

94
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,760
We've placed our fate in the hands of an IQ 94.

95
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,660
I was crazy. She will get caught.

96
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,150
She will surely get caught.

97
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,360
Next. Your recognition ability and your problem-solving ability.

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,510
I will test them all in one go.

99
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,920
First, solve the calculus problem. Then multiply the number of each fruit.

100
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,590
Then using your olfactory sensor, find out the count of the ingredients that went into the pasta.

101
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,090
Then add up all of the answers and divide by three.

102
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,210
Then once you round up, that will be the passcode for the lock.

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,560
Find out what's in the box.

104
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,320
 But my IQ is 94. 

105
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,910
If you pass in 3 minutes, each second is minus one point.

106
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,430
 I am someone who gave up on math, you human being! 

107
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,990
Start.

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,400
 It doesn't matter how you get there, as long as you get to Seoul.  

109
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,590
The answer is an egg, Master.

110
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,560
What do I do?

111
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,890
How does a robot have such Corpernicus-like circumferential ability for problem solving?

112
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,460
It can't be!

113
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,030
 I don't know what he's talking about, but it sounds like a  compliment, so I'll laugh. 

114
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,820
Okay, fine.

115
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,270
But will you be able to do this, too?

116
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,400
The egg, peel it in 10 seconds.

117
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,960
But don't use any tools and--

118
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,170
Th... This is...

119
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,920
Columbus' egg?

120
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,440
I didn't expect it to be such a creative and smart robot!

121
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,010
 I'm sad. 

122
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,760
 To hear I'm smart for the first time in my life but from this idiot. 

123
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,740
I want to know what's going on.

124
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,350
Whatever is happening in there, I really want to know.

125
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,160
With his personality, if something went wrong, he would have chucked her outside.

126
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,940
Just an hour more to go. AG, it's just an hour. Please endure for an hour more.

127
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,200
That way, I can pay my card debt.

128
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,420
AG would be able to endure but that's Jo Ji Ah.

129
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,530
From now on, I speak in English and you answer in French.

130
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,380
Got it?

131
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,850
Why don't you answer me?

132
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,430
Make sure to answer this way if you are asked something in a foreign language.

133
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,100
The foreign language function in my system is out of order.

134
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,540
Please use me after you fix the error.

135
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,450
Why are you slipping up when you were working just fine?

136
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,110
Fine, I will be testing your search abilities.

137
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,450
AG-3, tell me the model number of the figure in the middle display.

138
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,050
If you pass the 10 second mark, I will--

139
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,140
The model number is NC-674865.

140
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,490
As the MGG game was launched simultaneously throughout the world,

141
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,490
that limited edition figure was included as part of the launch.

142
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,620
There are only fifty. Fifty figures came into the country two days ago, so it's quite a rare item.

143
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,100
 I worked my ass off and got you that rare item. 

144
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,700
Your search ability is quite magnificent indeed.

145
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,480
Plus 5 points.

146
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,080
 So how dare you con me out of my money, you dine-and-dash jerk. 

147
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,280
But you.

148
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,440
Since earlier, something has been...

149
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,700
a little strange with you.

150
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,370
 What? What? What's so strange about me, huh? 

151
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,430
Oh, I know! I know what's wrong with you.

152
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,750
 You jerk, where are you looking? Turn your eyes away! 

153
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,000
Your breasts are bigger than they were yesterday.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,270
 They were originally that big, okay? 

155
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,460
Wait a minute. Did the battery get swollen or something?

156
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,740
- Let's open it up.
 -  Look where? 

157
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,300
Stay still! I want to check it out.

158
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,160
 What do you need to check? Have you gone mad?! 

159
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,510
Hey!

160
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,980
It's working.

161
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,060
You freaking bastard! You little peanut who has been dipped in sesame seed oil!

162
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,980
You're handsome enough to rip a fox's liver out, but are you a rising star of the perverted psycho kingdom, huh?!

163
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,670
Look here, you think you are lost in the galaxy of Andromeda? Would you like me to help you find your way back?!

164
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,360
The feeling of your head flying downward when bungee jumping in the Grand Canyon.

165
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,670
Do you want me to help you feel it from head to toe, you freaking jerk!

166
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,950
Oh my goodness.

167
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,500
What should we do?

168
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,940
 What are you looking at? Why are you staring at me? 

169
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,900
 If it weren't for the money, you would be dead meat already. 

170
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,910
 Timing and Subtitles by The Robotic Team @ viki.com  

171
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,780
Yes, Chairman.

172
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,530
Who are you trying to fool here?

173
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,600
 Yes, it's strange for me not to get caught. 

174
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,330
Sorry, but the truth is...

175
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,230
You used cheap batteries, didn't you?

176
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,450
Pardon?

177
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,200
Isn't that the reason why it's all heated and swollen?

178
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,110
What are you going to do if her chest blows up or something at this rate?!

179
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,200
Well, that is...

180
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,150
Yes, it would be bad if it blew up like that, for sure...
   

181
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,300
Yes, the operating time is...

182
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,310
To increase operating time, we inserted a part that has higher performance

183
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,600
and that's probably the reason why it got a little bigger.

184
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,020
But there might be an issue with overheating, so don't touch the chest.

185
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,630
Are you sure about this?

186
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,890
 What a dumbass. 

187
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,130
And one more thing. Friend mode suddenly turned on just now.

188
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,860
Do I have to power off and turn back on again?

189
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,190
No, no. While operating, you just have to command it to go back to operation mode.

190
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,970
Okay.

191
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,820
I can't take this anymore.

192
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,770
My motto in life is not to associate with anyone that cusses.

193
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,870
But why does it feel so refreshing to hear a robot curse? As if I had a nice drink of cold cider?

194
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,010
Maybe because the way you swear is very creative?

195
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,840
 It's because you are dumb. 

196
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,590
How amazing.

197
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,490
Go back to operation mode.

198
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,470
Yes, Master.

199
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,210
Yes, Team Leader Jo.

200
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,370
The social contribution team leader's audit results have come out.

201
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,480
It's been discovered that he has been embezzling money from the projects he has been involved in for the past three years.

202
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,260
Get him to write a resignation letter right away.

203
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,920
You want me to do it?

204
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,330
Then shall I do it?

205
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,340
If he doesn't leave on his own, you can tell him that he will be sued for his embezzlement.

206
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,860
Oh, and there's another lawsuit.

207
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,510
What else did you do while there was no Wi-Fi connection? Hurry up and confess.

208
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,800
Don't worry, I didn't get caught.

209
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,040
A robot cannot react nor respond to anything that hasn't been programmed already. I already told you that.

210
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,260
I'm doing just that, okay?

211
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,050
You are an avatar right now.  So just do what AG-3 tells you.

212
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,540
I will make sure to sue this person no matter what I do.

213
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,100
That thief who stole my necklace.

214
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,300
We can't continue like this. Pi, how much time is left?

215
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,560
Thirty minutes.

216
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,680
We'll use the battery as an excuse to shorten the time.

217
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,200
Bring AG-3 back right away.

218
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,170
I will find the evidence that she stole the necklace by digging through the black box or whatever it takes.

219
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,970
So just prepare for the lawsuit, okay?

220
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,420
Just you wait, CEO Jo.

221
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,870
 He's driving me nuts. 

222
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,280
I'm going to make sure to put you in jail.

223
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,430
 I didn't take that necklace. 

224
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,150
AG-3.

225
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,720
Starting now, I will test your morality level.

226
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,320
There is a thief who gave me a damaged product and even stole my necklace in the process.

227
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,470
So should I send her away to jail or should I just get the necklace back and

228
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,560
let her go?

229
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,370
 Under criminal law, article 333 

230
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,000
 it is a crime that can receive imprisonment for up to three years. 

231
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,690
I recommend you to sue instead of letting her go to prevent relapse.

232
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,140
So that there will be no victims who feel injustice,

233
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,450
and there can also be a mistake or a misunderstanding between them,

234
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,050
I suggest that you re-evaluate the situation. What do you think, Master?

235
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,390
Why are you siding with the criminal when I'm your master?

236
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,770
You should be on your master's side no matter what.

237
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,570
I'm always on your side, Master.

238
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,860
Master, you can be wrong sometimes. Don't you think so, Master?

239
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,630
Seriously, you little... You keep calling me master since a while ago,

240
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,480
but you've been a little smart ass,  stealthily bugging the heck out of me.

241
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,380
You! That's for being disgraceful! Minus twenty points.

242
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,900
What was so wrong about what I did anyway?

243
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,290
Hey, what you doing?  Hey, AG-3 can't run like that! Hey, stop running!

244
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,400
You all right?

245
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:15,330
What the hell did you just do to me?

246
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,800
   

247
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,490
   

248
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,920
   

249
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,130
Various human expressions have been programmed into me.

250
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,710
Master, a  little while ago you were in need of an emergency medical attention.

251
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,550
If you are willing to train me, I will be able to do a lot of different tasks for you.

252
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,630
 Lift your right foot while you lift your left hand. Lift your right hand. 

253
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,190
-  Lift your left hand twice then lift your left hand again.  
 - Why can't she do it?

254
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,350
She's going to throw out her back, watch it.

255
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,170
Oh my.

256
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,970
Looks a bit hideous. What should we do?

257
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,910
I'm hungry.

258
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,600
How can you eat after causing that mess?

259
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,150
I didn't get caught.

260
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,650
I was an orphaned duck, so if you look at it, I put up a pretty good defense.

261
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,530
Do you even know what a good defense means that you're using it?

262
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,490
Do you know how much this project is worth? What's in that head of yours?

263
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,380
Do you even have any thoughts? Do you think at all?

264
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,050
 What are you doing? 

265
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,230
 Oh, you're here. 

266
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,330
 Why are you doing things that I didn't ask you to do? Think before you act. 

267
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,280
All of you had a hard time because of me, right? You worked hard.

268
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,610
If we ever see each other sometime down the road, I'll buy a drink.

269
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,290
Change the face of the robot immediately.

270
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,890
I'm going to change it. I am.

271
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,920
I was crazy to use your face. I was nuts.

272
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,210
The two of them are way too different.

273
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,600
That's right. It's all in the past,

274
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,050
and I'll call it even for 10,000,000 won.

275
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,730
She's still good at just taking off after making me upset.

276
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,920
Nothing has changed with her.

277
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,240
How can she be exactly the same? How?!

278
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,250
 Let's break up. 

279
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,370
 Be well. 

280
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,890
The same. Exactly the same.

281
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,110
Welcome, President Martin.

282
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,910
It was such a long trip. You must be tired.

283
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,810
Yeah. I'll be fine.

284
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,330
The contract is ready, so you can just take a rest for tonight.

285
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,890
Good.

286
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,690
- Excuse me for a second. 
 - Sure.

287
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,510
Yeah, what is it?

288
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,590
We're canceling the sale of Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&amp;D team.

289
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,070
We can't sell it at the price that was offered by the Bold Group.

290
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,340
What are you talking about? Don't you know that we're signing the contract tomorrow?

291
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,980
I was hands off because you said you were going to take charge of the acquisition and divestiture of Daeyang Shipbuilding,

292
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,380
but it looks like you're not yet at the level of handling these types of deals.

293
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,310
Kim Min Kyu. Hey, Kim Min--

294
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,840
Is there something wrong?

295
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,220
This is beef thin skirt. This is the thick skirt. This is neck meat.

296
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,390
Now, lay down a sheet of beef brisket in lieu of lettuce leaf.

297
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,090
Lay the thick skirt meat on.

298
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,280
Then a bit of soybean paste.

299
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,360
Wrap it up with the beef brisket and into your mouth in one go.

300
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,190
We have food at home. What a waste of money to eat out.

301
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,120
It's not to feed you, you know.

302
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm feeding my nephew in your tummy, all right?

303
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,550
Brat.

304
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,090
Sorry about yesterday.

305
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm more and more sorry.

306
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,790
I paid back the loan principal earlier, too.

307
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,860
Where did you get the money?

308
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,980
Money struck down from the bright sky in a very filthy way.

309
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,060
Where is that? Let me get struck, too.

310
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,590
By the way, is this yours? I was going to do laundry and it was in the pocket.

311
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,080
The necklace!

312
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,210
If you jump out at this moment,

313
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,620
then I'm super speechless and will be humiliated by that dine-and-dash jerk.

314
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,360
I guess she's scared since I said I'd sue her.

315
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,030
This little--

316
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,250
♫  Don't frown  ♫

317
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,130
Apologize. Then I won't break your necklace and return it to you.

318
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,430
What? Apologize?

319
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,180
Accusing me of being a con-man and beating the heck out of me.

320
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,930
I feel so wronged that I need your apology first.

321
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,990
You're playing me now?

322
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,950
If you won't apologize, I can't give you this necklace.

323
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,330
Hey, beg me for money instead and I will consider it.

324
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,320
You clearly stole the necklace but you deceived me saying you didn't.

325
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,820
But then? You want me to apologize to the person who deceived me? Don't be funny.

326
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,140
The necklace? If you want to break it, break it. But know this!

327
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,570
I will find you somehow no matter what and absolutely make you pay the price.

328
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,480
Then? Your life will be a chaotic mess.

329
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,190
If you're confident, go for it!

330
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,830
Hey, you idiot! Is your head full of udon noodles instead of a brain?

331
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,950
What?

332
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,050
I mean, why don't you trust a person's words? Why do you judge and misunderstand the way you want?

333
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,950
 Because of you, I hurt my back. 

334
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,240
If I needed money, I would've asked you for the hospital fee.

335
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,630
I don't remember taking the necklace so I said I didn't.

336
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,440
And now that I found it, I'm contacting you so I can at least give it to you now.

337
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,990
You've got no one around you, right? You've got no friends, right? I don't have to see it to know it!

338
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,210
Yeah! Yeah! I've got no one around me. I don't let them.

339
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,810
Rather than have people like you around me, I'd have a robot around instead.

340
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,670
What's wrong with me? How am I worse than that robot?

341
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,860
What?

342
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,800
I am about to send you a parcel right now so send me your address within a minute.

343
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,760
Or else I will throw your necklace into the trash can and leave.

344
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,830
Trash can?

345
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,640
Hello? Hey! Hey, you crazy CEO Jo!

346
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,610
She's definitely crazy.

347
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,330
It's on. Light's on!

348
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,230
I had to grind up my soul to make this.

349
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:51,030
Thank you. I am really so grateful. CEO, you're a total genius.

350
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,450
Now, I just need to do well on my presentation. I hope that KM Financial will pick me.

351
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,380
I want to be picked! Really.

352
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:24,240
What? The robot is my life saver?

353
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,240
That's one useful thing about her then.

354
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,450
Left side. Yeah, left side.

355
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,680
Left side, more.

356
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,630
Feels good. Lower. More.

357
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,290
So good. Right side, too. Lower.

358
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,670
If you will train me, I can do more for you, Master.

359
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:18,450
Yeah, this is the kind of robot I needed.

360
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,860
Well... shall I train a robot?

361
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,200
