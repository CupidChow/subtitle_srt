4
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:41,720
Princess, what are you doing
at the Moon Palace?

5
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,160
Have you forgotten my warning?

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,520
You're so anxious about your master,

7
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
but your master is only
devoted to my brother.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,320
I feel sorry for you.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,520
You've tried to come between us
several times.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,200
What exactly do you want?

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,320
Do you think I'd believe you?

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
My brother and your master
are getting married.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't you know?

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,200
My brother has even prepared
the wedding dress.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
At this moment, Master Hei Lian

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,120
is trying on the wedding dress...

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,240
in my brother's

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,240
chamber.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
(This is a virtual world.)

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,400
(Tian Yuxue is just a virtual person.)

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,440
(As long as I can find out the truth,)

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,680
(marrying him won't be a problem.)

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,440
(Ye Wuming?)

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,560
(Why is he here?)

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
(His gaze...)

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,920
(Why do I feel sad?)

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
It really fits well.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,080
I'll pick an auspicious day

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
to hold our wedding as soon as possible.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
(Lu Ning,)

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
(don't waver.)

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,933
(Everything is for the sake
of the truth.)

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,120
(Ye Wuming!)

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,480
An urgent matter has arisen.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,480
Master, please follow me back.

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,120
Ye Wuming,

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,520
how dare you!

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
My chamber isn't somewhere
you can barge in.

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,280
Master, please,

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,920
follow me back.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,240
Your master is discussing
her wedding with me.

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,000
Nothing is more urgent than this.

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
Look at your master.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
Look how beautiful she is

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,240
in this wedding dress.

46
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:57,760
Your Highness, if you insist
on keeping my master,

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
even if you control my heart,

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll fight you to the death.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,760
(Ye Wuming.)

50
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,600
(No!)

51
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,080
It seems

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,120
Ye Wuming really cares about her.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
Why not use the marriage contract
to threaten him?

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,280
I'm sure

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,280
he'll help you find the Wuji Grass.

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
Perhaps

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,400
we could kill two birds with one stone.

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,240
What do you mean?

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,320
Once a woman signs
the marriage contract,

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,320
her husband can obtain her major heart.

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,680
I've checked in the secret scroll.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,840
The major heart

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,440
can nourish your formation.

64
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,520
I'll marry Hei Lian first,

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,920
then force Ye Wuming
to retrieve the Wuji Grass.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,640
Then,

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
we'll have a chance

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,120
to revive Rushuang.

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Ye Wuming!

70
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,920
Master, do you really want
to marry King Ling?

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,920
What?

72
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
If not,

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,880
why would you wear the wedding dress?

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
I don't have time to explain to you.

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,200
Are you angry at me

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,840
for ruining your marriage
with King Ling?

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
Don't be unreasonable.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,160
You don't understand.

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,960
I do.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,880
I know what people in love would do.

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,160
If I could also do it,

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,520
would you marry me?

83
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,040

No!

Quick, help me check

103
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,266
if these beads belong
to the Teleportation Ticket.

104

Yes.

105

The blue bead

106

represents a high-level
security officer's ticket.

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,910
only one high-level security officer
has entered this world.

109
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,240
Your dad.

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,880
Where did you find this?

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,720
But why?

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
Why didn't he go back
even though he had torn it off?

113
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,920
Maybe

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640
the bracelet wasn't
on his hand at the time.

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,760
You haven't told me yet.

116
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,920
Where did this come from?

117
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,840
From Tian Yuxue's chamber.

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Tian Yuxue?

119
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,320
There's something fishy about this.

120
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,400
I must investigate.

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,400
Since

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
Tian Yuxue has

123
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,440
my dad's Teleportation Ticket,

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,840
he might know the truth
about my dad's death.

125
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,000
Perhaps

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,720
Tian Yuxue's chip
could reveal the truth.

127
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,400
Ning,

128
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,520
don't act recklessly.

129
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,920
Tian Yuxue is a pervert.

130
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,320
He's more dangerous than Ye Wuming.

131
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
With Ye Wuming around, I'll be safe.

132
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
Why do you trust Ye Wuming so much?

133
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,080
You aren't in love with him, are you?

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
How can that be?

136
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,440
saving his life was out of necessity.

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,760
Since he's the strongest in this world,

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,240
I should make good use of him

139
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
to protect myself.

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,360
What if he discovers you're using him?

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Don't worry.

142
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
I won't get entangled with him anymore.
