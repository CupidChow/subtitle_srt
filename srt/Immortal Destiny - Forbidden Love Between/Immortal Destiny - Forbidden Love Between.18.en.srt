=Episode 18=

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,720
If you don't want to be
like Liu Rushuang,

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,480
don't move.

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Follow me.

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,440
She's...

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
I didn't want anyone to know,

9
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,120
but I don't want you
to misunderstand me.

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,320
So,

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,040
what I saw in the mirror...

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
An illusion I created with magic.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
I just used it

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,160
to provoke Tian Yuxue.

15
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,120
I...

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,840
I was too impulsive.

18
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,040
I shouldn't have treated you like that.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
Why didn't you explain to me?

20
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,640
I didn't want him to know.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,520
I wanted him to suffer.

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,440
I thought you'd understand me.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,760
Even if the whole world

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,760
thinks I'm a cruel

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,000
and heartless monster,

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,560
I thought

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,080
you'd know

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,360
there's still some warmth in me.

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
But you accused me right away,

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
without giving me a chance to explain.

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
At that moment...

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,160
At that moment,

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,840
the shock was too big.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
I couldn't react immediately,

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,280
so...

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,320
So what Tian Yuxue said is true.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,160
He said,

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,960
I'm doomed to be alone.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,400
Ye Wuming.

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,200
Palace Master,

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,640
King Ye has been preparing
for a long time.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,480
He captured the finest embroiderers
from the Golden Silk Clan

43
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,920
and ordered them to work overnight,

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
using only the finest silk threads.

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
Palace Master,

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,840
look how beautiful
this wedding dress is.

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,840
(Ye Wuming will be deleted
by the Bureau)

48
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,000
(because of me.)

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,760
(I must get out as soon as possible.)

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
(I need to persuade the Bureau)

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,600
(to save you.)

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Why do you like sneaking

53
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,320
into my chamber so much?

54
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,480
I just came to see

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,800
how your injury was.

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,840
It's not the first time
you've stabbed me.

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,880
You know I won't die from your strength.

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,680
Are you still angry with me?

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,680
Here, take this.

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Tomorrow you're going to war.

61
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,160
I put a lot of effort into making this.

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,800
If you don't want it,

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
I'll burn it.

64
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,080
I really will burn it.

65
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,080
Who said I don't want it?

66
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,920
I like it very much.

67
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,540
(Safe)

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
You're not angry?

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
I wasn't angry to begin with.

70
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,520
I was just hurt.

What is it?

76
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,920
From now on, this will be your chamber.

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,680
You won't have to sneak in anymore.

78
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,800
You can come openly.

Palace Master, what do you need from me?

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,400
Do you know

87
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,040
what could threaten Ye Wuming?

88
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,320
I already gave you the poisonous bug.

89
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,000
Isn't that enough?

90
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,240
Even if he loses his spiritual power,

91
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,880
I might not be able to get what I want.

92
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
So I want to take something

93
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,800
he cares about to exchange with him.

94
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,200
I know,

95
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,040
in the entire Xuanling Clan,

96
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,480
your intelligence is the most extensive.

97
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,240
What he cares about the most is you.

98
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Don't you know that?

99
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
I do.

100
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,800
What I'm asking is,

101
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,080
besides me.

102
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,800
That'd be

103
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
his mother's meridian.

104
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,840
Didn't his mother die a long time ago?

105
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
Back then, Hei Lian
wiped out his entire clan

106
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,160
and killed his mother,

107
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,920
but she retrieved her meridian.

108
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Although

109
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,520
she's dead,

110
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,800
her spirit lives on.

111
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
This way, she can

112
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,320
watch her child enduring
unimaginable torture

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
day and night.

114
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
It's too cruel.

115
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,320
What,

116
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
you can't bear it?

117
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,000
Where is his mother's meridian?

118
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
He keeps it in the secret chamber
of King Ling.

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
See that light in the distance?

120
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,360
He's exterminating the Wolf Clan.

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,360
Now

122
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,640
