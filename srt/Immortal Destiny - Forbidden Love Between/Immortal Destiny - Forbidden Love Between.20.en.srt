Lu Ning,

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,120
no!

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,720
Ye Wuming,

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
what's wrong?

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,320
Ye Wuming,

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,040
you're really weak now.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
I gave you a chance
but you couldn't even kill me.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,040
I promised my master

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,840
I wouldn't kill again.

13
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,240
Ye Wuming.

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,880
Go!

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Go!

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
Use the bracelet.

17
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,480
Go back.

Didn't you tell me...

26
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
I did tell you not to kill.

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,160
I was wrong.

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,760
Ye Wuming,

30
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,320
if killing is a sin,

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,360
then let me bear

I'm here.

38
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
I know you've always wanted to leave.

39
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,640
It was my wishful thinking

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,360
to keep you by my side.

41
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,040
Now you can go.

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,200
Who says I want to leave?

43
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,960
Do you really want

44
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
to stay here with me?

45
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,440
My friend told me,

46
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
in light or in darkness,

47
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,400
I must choose one side.

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,360
I can't have it all.

49
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,200
I know I hurt you.

50
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
I was so foolish

51
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,960
to conspire with Tian Yaoge

52
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
to harm you.

53
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,840
Every day, I keep thinking

54
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,400
about what I should do

55
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,280
if you hate me.

56
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
Don't say that.

57
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,800
It's my fault.

58
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,680
Then we're even.

59
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,320

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,760

the old followers of Tian Yuxue
are on the move.

75
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,640

After our wedding,

77
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
I'll kill him.

78
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,240
You have a guest today.

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560

81
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Speaking of which,

82
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,040

85
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,480
You kissed him.

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,040
kiss you?

89
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,120
It doesn't matter.

90
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,840
Aren't you leaving?

91
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,200
He's really handsome, huh?

95
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,360
Now you can only look at me,

96
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,200

I have.
