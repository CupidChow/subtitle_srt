=Episode 24=

4
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,900
You remember something,

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,540
right?

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,040
Yes,

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
we're from the same world.

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,520
So,

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,160
you're driving me away,

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,360
keeping things from me,

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,600
because we only have

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
one Teleportation Ticket?

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
I'm not leaving.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,160
If you don't leave, I won't either.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,600
Whether it's forgetting

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,800
or torturing each other,

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,400
I want to stay with you forever.

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,920
Who said that?

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,880
Who said we only have one ticket?

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,400
With your dad's bracelet,

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,880
I managed to repair another one.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,360
You haven't told me

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,680
what your name is.

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll tell you

25
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
when we get back.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,600
Wu Ce said,

27
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
once we go back,

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,000
we'll forget everything here.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,520
Will we really forget each other?

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,200
Even if we do forget,

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,360
when we meet again,

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,240
I'll definitely recognize you.

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,800
On our wedding day,

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,080
you asked me

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,880
if I regretted meeting you.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
I want to answer again.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't regret it.

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
I don't regret meeting you

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,200
or anything we've experienced together.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
The only regret is

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
not loving you sooner.

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,280
We'll see each other in that world.

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Together.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,600
Three,

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,800
two,

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,000
one.

48
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
(Moon Palace)

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,720
Ye Wuming.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,760
Ye Wuming.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,160
You lied to me again.

52
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,560
The bracelet can't be repaired.

54
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,520
But this way,

55
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
you can go back without any worries.

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
No.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,760
I don't want to go alone.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Lu Ning,

59
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,840
I once promised you

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,080
to fulfill

61
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
all your wishes for you.

62
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,760
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,280
I might not be able to do that.

64
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,960
After you go back,

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,800
you must forget me

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,640
and live on.

67
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,720
Lu Ning,

68
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,480
my name is Xu Yichi.

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
I love you.

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,720
I love you too,

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
Xu Yichi.

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
I love you.

73
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Ning.

74
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,120
Ning.

75
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,440
Ning.

76
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
You finally came back.

77
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,840
What happened to me?

78
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,640
Lu Ning,

79
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,000
you avenged your dad.

80
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,240
It's been five years.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,120
You did it.

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
I'm so tired.

83
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
It feels like I had a very long dream.

84
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,840
Ning,

85
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,400
you were amazing.

86
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
You didn't know,

87
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,040
we were so nervous just now.

88
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,200
Just one second.

89
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
One more second and you couldn't return.

90
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Really?

91
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,440
I want to walk alone for a bit.

92
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,640
Do you think

93
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,840
she really forgot?

94
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,080
Sometimes,

95
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
forgetting is happier

96
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
than remembering, right?

97
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,160
(I don't think)

98
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,480
(she really forgot.)

99
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
(She just doesn't dare to remember.)
