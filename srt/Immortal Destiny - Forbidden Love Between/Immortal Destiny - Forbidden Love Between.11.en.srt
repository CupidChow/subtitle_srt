4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,000
This is...

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,000
Where did you get this?

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,880
Did you go to Tian Yuxue?

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,480
Ye Wuming.

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
I've said it before.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,960
I'll definitely get

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,360
anything you want for you.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,080
Ye Wuming,

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,560
what's wrong?

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,440
Ye Wuming.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,520
Ye Wuming.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,920
Ye Wuming.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,520
You've been poisoned.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,620
♪The flutes and the wine
dissipate into nothingness♪

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:38,380
♪It matters not,
because this love will last forever♪

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,160
Tian Yaoge.

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,880
What's wrong, Palace Master?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,040
You can't hold the sword steady.

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
Give me the antidote.

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,480
What antidote?

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
Don't play dumb with me.

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Ye Wuming has been poisoned.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
Give me the antidote.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
Ye Wuming has been poisoned?

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,960
Are you serious?

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,200
(Ye Wuming's blood)

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,320
(is the best material
for nurturing a Love Bug.)

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,800
The Ten-day Love poison
only affects those who're in love.

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,280
When the illusion breaks in ten days,
one'll die of a broken heart.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,080
Hei Lian, you really have skills.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,840
You really made him fall in love.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,240
I don't want to waste my breath.

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,200
Will you give it or not?

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
Why would I give it to you?

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
Tian Yaoge,

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,920
does His Highness know

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,320
it was you who instructed Ye Wuming
to steal the sacred relic?

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,320
Are you threatening me?

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,800
If you kill me,

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,680
His Highness won't let you off.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,040
I believe His Highness
keeps me around for a reason.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,920
But if he finds out

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,640
you resorted to such methods

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,280
to make him lose the sacred relic

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
because you couldn't
kill Ye Wuming,

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,040
I wonder if he'll still protect you.

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,280
Use your blood
to administer this medicine.

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
You're not lying to me, are you?

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,600
Why would I lie to you?

53
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
So you could go to my brother
and tell on me?

54
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
Wait a moment.

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,400
That was a love potion just now.

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,520
This is the real antidote.

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,160
Tian Yaoge,

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,520
I'm telling you.

59
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm racing against time to save him now.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,640
If you dare toy with me again,

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,200
I'll spare no expense

62
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
to kill you.

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,520
You haven't returned the love potion.

64
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,160
You're fine now.

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,800
I had a dream,

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,320
in which you wanted to kill me.

67
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Are you afraid?

68
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm not afraid.

69
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm more afraid of you leaving me.

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
Master, please don't leave me.

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,040
No.

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,360
Ye Wuming,

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,400
stop pestering me.

74
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,440
I'll leave you eventually.

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,300
♪Wind, wrinkles brows not by my will♪

76
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Pestering?

77
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,800
In your eyes,

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,040
is that what I'm doing?

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

80
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,960
You're just a killing tool I trained.

81
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,600
My kindness towards you

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,000
is merely taking advantage of you.

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,400
No matter what you do,

84
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
it won't change our relationship.

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,800
No,

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,720
I don't believe it.

87
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
Your gaze just now

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,600
showed you care for me.

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,720
And master, you clearly said...

90
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,320
No matter what I say,
it doesn't matter.

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,560
I've already signed
a marriage contract with King Ling.

92
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,160
I already belong to Tian Yuxue.

93
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,680
I'll soon marry him.

94
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,280
What are you saying?

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,160
I already signed a marriage contract
with King Ling long ago.

96
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
When?

97
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,080
The day after I tried on
my wedding dress.

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
So,

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
while I was doing
so many things for you,

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,120
trying my best to please you,

101
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
you signed a marriage contract with him?

102
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,640
Yes.

103
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,400
Why didn't you tell me?

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Why?

105
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
In your eyes,

106
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,840
I was like a fool,

107
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
begging you, pleasing you,

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,480
bothering you,

109
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
and you didn't tell me?

110
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,320
I've already told you

111
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,560
I was going to marry King Ling.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
That's different.

113
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
That's different.

114
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,640
Do you know
what that piece of paper means

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,200
to the Xuanling Clan?

116
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
It's a lifetime vow.

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
No matter what it means,

118
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,600
it's the same to me.

119
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,400
I want to be the queen
of the Xuanling Clan.

120
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
My intention won't change.

121
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,480
Do you really care so much
about King Ling?

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Yes.

123
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,240
So I hope you can let me go.

124
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,960
Let you go?

125
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,280
After all I've done for you,

126
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
all I get is

127
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,400
"let you go"?

128
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,040
I won't let you go.

129
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,800
Nor will I let you marry him.

130
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,080
The King of the Xuanling Clan?

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,200
Whatever he can give you,

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,920
