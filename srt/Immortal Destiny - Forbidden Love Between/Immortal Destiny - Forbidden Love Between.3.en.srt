00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,010
(Adapted from "System Forced Me"
written by Xiaomanyao)

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,420
=Episode 3=

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,440
Your Highness.

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,120
You just injured his heart vessels.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
If you kill him

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
so easily,

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
wouldn't it be a waste?

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,600
Fine.

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,280
For your sake,

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,360
I'll spare him today.

12
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,660
(Xuantian Palace)

13
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,380
(Tian Yaoge, Xuantian Palace)

14
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:30,688
(Liu Rushuang)
Yuxue,

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,360
it's been 1,800 years,
and she still hasn't woken up.

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
Are you going to keep waiting?

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
As long as you use
the Seven Stars Formation

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,720
to preserve Rushuang's body from decay,

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,280
I'll give you Ye Wuming.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,040
Ye Wuming is emotionless.

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,960
His blood is the best material
for cultivating the Love Bug.

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,520
How is your Rejuvenation Pill
coming along?

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,360
To refine the pill,

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,080
I need the Wuji Grass
from the Zhaoyao Sect.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,240
But Ye Wuming has destroyed

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
the entire Zhaoyao Sect.

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,960
Only a child remains

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,000
with whereabouts unknown.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,800
The Wuji Grass is also missing.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,360
Yuxue,

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,560
do you think

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Hei Lian sent Ye Wuming
to destroy the Zhaoyao Sect

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,280
because they discovered our secret?

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,160
Find some people

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,880
and make sure
to bring that child back to me.

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
Hei Lian,

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
if you have ulterior motives against me,

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,200
I'll make you and Ye Wuming
disappear together.

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Take off your clothes.

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
I'll apply the medicine.

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,760
Master, stop pretending to care.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
I can heal myself.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,440
Pretending?

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Master, you asked me to King Ling's hall

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
for punishment,

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
then saved me,

47
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:08,360
and now want to apply medicine for me.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,440
What are your true intentions?

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
Do you want me to be grateful to you?

50
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
If that's what you think,

51
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,880
I have nothing more to say.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Whatever. Here's the medicine.

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,680
I hope your wounds fester, and you die.

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,520
Ye Wuming,

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,600
you jerk!

56
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:38,800
You're driving me crazy.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
Did you climb onto his bed again?

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,720
Do I have nothing better to do

59
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,688
than climb onto his bed?

60
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,680
Then why did his emotions
fluctuate again just now?

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,800
His emotions fluctuated?

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,000
When?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,080
Just now.

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Just now?

65
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:57,080
Because I brought him the medicine?

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
Hei,

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,520
what exactly has Ye Wuming been through?

68
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,080
He was born into the infamous

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,480
assassination family, the Ye Clan.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,422
He's the illegitimate son of their
eldest daughter and King Xuanling.

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
Please spare him.

72
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,640
Spare my child.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,880
(After Hei Lian destroyed the Ye Clan,)

74
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,280
(she took his heart)

75
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,111
(and brought him to the Moon Palace
while he was still a child.)

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
(Due to his cold-blooded nature,)

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,000
(she trained him
to be the perfect killing tool.)

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,840
(His brother, Tian Yuxue,)

79
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,280
(used the heart to control)

80
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
(and torment him,)

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,360
(making his life a living hell.)

82
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,480
(He grew up in the dark Moon Palace)

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
(like a lone wolf.)

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,760
(He repeats this kind of life)

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,840
(for all eternity.)

86
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,480
(He's never experienced warmth.)

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,280
(For someone like him,)

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
(if I treat him kindly)

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
and with a little suffering,

90
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
he should be easily moved.

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,520
Offering warmth is fine.

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
You can't let him die

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
before finding the chip.

94
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,120
But don't risk your life to save him.

95
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,920
Ensure your own safety first.

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,960
Don't worry.

97
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,600
(I have a feeling)

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
(he's not that simple.)

99
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,240
(To truly move him,)

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
(it might indeed
require risking my life.)

101
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:35,150
(Firefly Forest)

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,620
(Prince of Fox Clan)

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,000
Where is it?

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
Where is the thing I need?

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,240
You forced your spiritual power

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
to destroy the Zhaoyao Sect.

107
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,490
So you have to give
fresh blood in exchange

108
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,220
for our Eternal Talisman
to extend your life.

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,360
Is it worth it?

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,800
Nangong Jue was Tian Yuxue's man.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
If I don't destroy them,

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll eventually die at their hands.

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Ye Wuming,

114
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
why go through so much trouble

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
to seize Tian Yuxue's throne?

116
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,360
If you agree

117
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,866
to our Saintess's proposal,

118
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,377
(Saintess)
we'll immediately send troops

119
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,000
(of Fox Clan)
to retrieve your heart.

120
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
If you're free from his control,

121
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,040
killing him would be effortless for you.

122
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,840
Enough.

123
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,240
My matters don't concern you.

124
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,640
See you tomorrow.

125
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,040
What a cold and heartless person.

126
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,880
(I'll use a double dose this time.)

127
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,160
(Maybe he'll sleep longer.)

128
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,720
Do you need me?

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
(How could this be?)

130
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,040
(My eyes only left him for a second.)

131
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:24,120
(How did he move so fast?)

132
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
What are you doing?

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,240
