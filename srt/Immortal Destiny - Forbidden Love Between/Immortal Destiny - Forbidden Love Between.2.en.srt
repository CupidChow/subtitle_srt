00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,760
Ye Wuming,

5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,666
what do you want to do?

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,120
Master, you climb into my bed at night.

7
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,840
And you ask me what I want?

8
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,840
What,

9
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,160
do you want to make me your boy toy?

10
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,800
Do you think you're qualified?

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,520
If you don't want to favor me,

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,880
then...

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,120
Do you want to kill me?

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,280
You think you can kill me?

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,755
(Such a terrifying killing intent.)

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
(Is he really going to kill me?)

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,840
(I need to find a way
to get out of here.)

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,760
Do you want to be

19
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,880
my boy toy that badly?

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,160
I'll grant your wish.

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,920
Take off your clothes.

22
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,840
Are you serious, Master?

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
I'm serious.

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,760

37
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:49,760
Ye Wuming, you're overthinking it.

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
You're far worse

39
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,760
compared to my boy toys.

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,280
Who's there?

41
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,480
It's me, Hei.

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,320
Come in.

43
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
Ye Wuming's data

44
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,640
fluctuated just now.

45
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,280
How did it go?

46
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,040
Did you succeed?

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,520
No.

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,960
I scanned him twice

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,000
but couldn't find the chip.

50
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,750
The greater a virtual person's
mood swings,

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
the stronger the chip signal.

52
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,680
Ye Wuming is basically emotionless,

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
so his signal is weak.

54
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Think of a way to make him emotional.

55
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,160
Emotional?

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,440
Should I seduce him?

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,960
At critical moments,
you have to step up.

58
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,780
(Moon Palace)

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,200
(Ye Wuming was here.)

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,600
(When?)

61
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
(How did I not notice at all?)

62
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,160
Palace Master,

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
King Ling is summoning you.

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,920
King Ling?

65
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,080
(That notorious killer?)

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,720
Tell Ye Wuming

67
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
to wait outside King Ling's hall.

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,800
If I don't come out

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,720
in half an hour,

70
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,480
he should come in directly.

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes.

72
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,911
(Xuantian Palace)

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,560
Your Highness.

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,920
(Tian Yuxue is the king
of the Xuanling Clan.)

75
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
(Why is he...)

76
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,180
(Tian Yuxue, Xuantian Palace)

77
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,040
You're my betrothed princess.

78
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,840
Since when did you become so distant?

79
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,400
(I see.)

80
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,120
You must be joking.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,920
Ye Wuming wiped out
the entire Zhaoyao Sect.

82
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Are you aware of that?

83
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I know.

84
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
Since you know,

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,120
why don't you kill him?

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,240
Why is that brat still alive?

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,200
(King Ling wants to kill Ye Wuming.)

88
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,600
(No way.)

89
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,600
(I need to find a reason
to keep him alive)

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,720
(until I get the chip.)

91
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,960
Your Highness, you didn't know.

92
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
I sent him to destroy the Zhaoyao Sect.

93
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,480
You sent him?

94
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,320
Why?

95
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Your Highness,

96
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,760
Nangong Jue had a body

97
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,040
of extreme yin and yang,

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,920
with the aura of Asura.

99
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,040
He came from an ancient sect

100
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,960
and was very talented.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,640
His presence in this world

102
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,360
would be a threat to you.

103
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,400
What did you say?

104
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,720
A threat to me?

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,040
Let me tell you,

106
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,880
no one in this world can threaten me.

107
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,400
No one can defeat me either.

108
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,600
Compared to Nangong Jue,

109
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,960
Ye Wuming is the only one
that disgusts me.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
His existence is a mistake.

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,520
You said

112
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,520
once we used him

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,110
to cultivate the Chaotic Demon Art,

114
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,080
we would kill him.

115
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,360
I can't tolerate his survival.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,560
How much longer must I wait?

117
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,280
Soon, Your Highness.

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,880
Soon.

119
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
We can't kill him now.

120
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Don't make me wait too long.

121
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,120
Alright.

122
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,800
What,

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,280
don't you like it anymore?

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,360
Your Highness,

125
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,080
I've been cultivating recently...

126
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,760
Hei Lian,

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,720
this isn't like you.

128
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Master,

129
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,720
it's time for your cultivation.

130
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
Who allowed you to come in,

131
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
you brat?

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,840
Hei Lian,

133
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,400
he spoiled my mood.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,720
Tell me

135
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,444
how he should be punished.

136
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,920
(He endured being stabbed before,)

137
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,400
(so a bit of whipping
shouldn't be an issue.)

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
How about

139
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,040
whipping him a few times?

140
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
You really know how to torment people.

141
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,680
The Wuji Whip

142
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,120
depletes one-tenth
of one's power with each lash

143
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,120
until bones are shattered.

144
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
(He won't die like this, will he?)

145
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,560
