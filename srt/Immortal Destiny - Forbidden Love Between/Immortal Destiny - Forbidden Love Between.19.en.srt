you must be exhausted.

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
You should've gone back
to Xuantian Palace to rest,

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,640
not come here.

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800

the first time I saw you,

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,240
you were also

coming towards me through the snow.

I just want to use you.

You don't want revenge anymore?

46

Even if I stay in this world,

47
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
you won't let me

48
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,480
kill him, right?

49
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
So,

50
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,840
you'd rather abandon
avenging your father

51
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,240
than stay with me?

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
You're even willing to violate
your own goodwill

53
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,040
and threaten me
with my mother's meridian?

Lu Ning,

55
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,720
do you really dislike me so much?

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,480
We're not from the same world.

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Enough.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,160
I don't want to hear you say these.

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Lu Ning,

60
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
I didn't expect you

61
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,560
to use my mother against me.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,040
You think if my power is gone,

63
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
I won't be able to kill you?

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,840
Or do you think
I wouldn't bear to kill you?

65
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Yes,

66
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
I couldn't bear to kill you.

67
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
I didn't expect

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
to let my mother

69
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,320
witness such a failure of mine.

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,720
Ye Wuming.

71
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,800
Our marriage contract is signed.

72
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,560
You can't escape from me.

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,360
Since you've betrayed my trust,

74
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,560
from today onwards,

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
you'll quietly stay here

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
until our wedding.

77
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,880
If you imprison me now,

78
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,320
I'll hate you for life.

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,120
Hate me?

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
That's fine.

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
You don't love me anyway.

82
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Then hate me.

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
The more the better.

84
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
Ye Wuming.

85
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
From today onwards,

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,760
Palace Master will be in seclusion.

87
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,920
She isn't allowed to leave
without a decree.

88
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,080
Yes.

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,100
(Xuantian Palace)

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
Who allowed you to come?

91
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm coming to my brother's chamber.

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,120
Do I need your permission?

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
You deliberately informed on me then,

94
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
just to let me know

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,120
she'd poison me
with the Love-cutting Bug, right?

96
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,840
With the Love-cutting Bug in hand,

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,920
the one who casts it will be poisoned

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
within ten days,

99
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
unless she plants the bug
into someone else.

100
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Otherwise,

101
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,280
one will die from the backlash.

102
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,160
Perhaps at first you were curious,

103
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,640
whether she'd really do it to you.

104
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,560
But once you understood the bug,

105
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,280
you'd willingly

106
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,000
bear all of it for her.

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,840
Even if she doesn't act,

108
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,600
you'd force her to do it.

109
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,080
You...

110
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,360
The relationships between people

111
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,880
are so complicated.

112
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,480
Clearly two people are close,

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,040
but they feel like
thousands of miles apart.

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Ye Wuming,

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,760
does she know how deeply

116
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
you feel for her?

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,360
I really don't know who's more foolish,
you or her.

118
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,400
You think you can deal with me

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,880
this way?

120
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,040
Ye Wuming,

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,680
look at your current state.

122
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,920
You can't even withstand
the Soul-detaching Powder.

123
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,280
How pathetic.

124
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,200
You...

125
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,480
Tian Yaoge.

126
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,600
Having been locked up for so long,

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,640
you must be in great pain.

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,040
King Ye is really ruthless.

129
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,200
It's OK.

130
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm here to save you.

131
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Save me?

132
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,400
More like framing me.

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,960
He already knew you were
going to frame him.

134
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,680
Do you think

135
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
he'd feel nothing

136
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,280
after you inject the bug
into his body?

137
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,120
He knows?

138
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
He's always known?

139
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,040
Then why did he still...

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,440
If he doesn't get poisoned, you'll die.

141
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,520
He's willing

142
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,360
to bear all of this for you.

143
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,720
But it's OK.

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
I'll fulfill your wish.
