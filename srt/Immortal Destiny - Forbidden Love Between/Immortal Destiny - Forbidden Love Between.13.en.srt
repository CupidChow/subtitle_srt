=Episode 13=

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,840
Hei Lian,

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,400
have you ever considered

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,120
if Yaoge is a master of using bugs,

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,080
then surely I am too?

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,280
Why do you think

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,920
you could deceive me?

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,240
I...

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,000
I just wanted

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
Your Highness to treat me a bit better,

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,240
so that's why...

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,440
Even if you used the finest materials,

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,840
a Love Bug brewed by a mere maid

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,160
from the Moon Palace

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
won't work on me.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,440
(Now is the best opportunity.)

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,840
Your Highness won't kill me, right?

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,120
We're about to be married.

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
How could you bear to do it?

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,280
If you wanted me dead,

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,160
you'd have done it long ago.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,440
Please, out of consideration

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,720
for my momentary foolishness

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,160
and deep affection for you,

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,960
forgive me.

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Ye Wuming,

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
come out!

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
No need to bother.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,000
Let me continue to drink
with Your Highness.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm not in the mood now.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Get lost.

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,760
(I was so close.)

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,440
(Ye Wuming,)

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
(if you gave me a little more time,)

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
(maybe I could find the chip.)

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,320
Ye Wuming,

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,480
why did you come?

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,040
You took my blood

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,120
just to do this?

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Yes,

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,120
your blood can brew the best Love Bug.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,240
I just wanted His Highness to love me,

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
and to be close to me.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Is that not allowed?

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
You sacrificed yourself,

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,480
pretended to care for me,

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,640
used me,

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,280
made me fall in love,

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
and then took my blood,

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,240
all just to make him love you.

53
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,000
I've signed
the marriage contract with His Highness.

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,000
He's my future husband.

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,040
I hope he loves me.

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
What's wrong with that?

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,520
You're right.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Then,

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,520
no matter what I do,

60
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,840
don't hate me.

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,720
Ye Wuming,

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,840
don't do anything foolish.

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
You'll die.

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,920
That's none of your concern anymore.

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
Is Ye Wuming

66
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,720
going to retrive his meridian?

67
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,440
You told him the location

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,240
of the seal?

69
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
I dare not deceive him.

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,640
He wanted to kill me.

71
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,680
This is your reason for betraying me?

72
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Rest assured, Yuxue.

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,200
I warned him.

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,560
If he goes for it now,

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,040
he won't withstand the thunder curse.

76
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
He'll wait a few days.

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,640
Get Hei Lian over.

78
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,960
I want to inform her,

79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,120
tomorrow I'll marry her.

80
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,480
Tomorrow?

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,440
Yes,

82
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,600
tomorrow.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Hei Lian,

84
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,400
since we've already signed
the marriage contract,

85
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,440
why delay further?

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,920
Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
I want you

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,720
to become my queen sooner.

89
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Why, don't you want to?

90
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
I know,

91
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,600
once the marriage contract is signed,

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,880
I belong to Your Highness.

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,720
I can't break the vow.

94
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,920
It's good that you know.

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,200
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

96
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
Today, you should rest well

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,720
and prepare to become my queen.

98
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Alright.

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,640
Yuxue,

100
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,680
Ye Wuming really

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,080
went into the Mystic Void Realm.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,080
What did you say?

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
He's a dead man.

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,440
(Did Ye Wuming really
go to retrieve his meridian?)

105
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,600
(He was just poisoned.)

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,080
(No way,)

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,760
(I must go see.)

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Ye Wuming,

109
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,880
do you know what you're doing?

110
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,680
I do.

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,480
Even if you defeat us,

112
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
you still have to withstand
99 thunder curses.

113
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,440
The pain of the thunder curse

114
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,080
far exceeds skinning and muscle pulling.

115
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,480
No ordinary person can endure that.

116
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,520
You'll die.

117
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
Even if I die,

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,840
I won't let anyone harm her.

119
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
Fine,

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,240
I'll grant your wish.

121
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,840
Your Highness,

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
tomorrow we'll be married.

123
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,600
I still need to prepare.

124
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,320
Prepare?

125
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,480
Aren't you anxious?

126
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,800
Knowing Ye Wuming went
to the Mystic Void Realm,

127
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
are you rushing to see

128
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,080
how he's doing?

129
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Since Your Highness knows

130
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,880
Ye Wuming went to the Mystic Void Realm,

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
why are you so relaxed?

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,440
Aren't you afraid he might
retrieve his meridian?

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
Retrieve his meridian?

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,640
Even if he can withstand

135
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,960
the 12 witches

136
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,600
and the 99 thunder curses,

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,920
he'll suffer severe harm.

138
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,600
Moreover,

139
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,840
I've already taken back
the physical form

140
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,480
of his meridian long ago.

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,600
The one in the Mystic Void Realm
is fake,

142
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,240
and it's poisoned.

143
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,840
Ye Wuming is undoubtedly doomed.

144
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
Doomed!

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,480
I can't believe you set a trap!

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
Let go of me!

147
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,240
I have to find him.

148
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,440
You're not going anywhere.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
Once the marriage contract is signed,

150
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,600
you're forever mine.

151
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,760
Mine!

152
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
Even if we sign the marriage contract,

153
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,120
I won't share the meridian with you.

154
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,760
I never intended to share
the meridian with you.

155
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,800
I only want your heart.

156
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
What do you mean by that?

157
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
At this point,

158
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,520
I won't hide it from you anymore.

159
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
Years ago,

160
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,920
I met a woman

161
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,880
named Liu Rushuang.

162
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,440
Liu Rushuang?

163
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,880
We truly loved each other.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,040
I thought

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
we'd be together forever.

166
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,680
Unfortunately,

167
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,280
someone from the Ninth Heavens came.

168
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,280
Ever since his appearance,

169
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,880
she never woke up again.

170
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,880
Someone from the Ninth Heavens?

171
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,080
She's the tourist you need
to bring back,

172
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,880
Liu Rushuang.

173
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,920
