4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,840
Let me go.

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,440
What do you want?

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,600
Let go of me.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,360
Today is your birthday.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
I have a gift for you.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,240
I lit up the whole city for you.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,080
I hope I can fulfill
all your wishes for you.

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,160
Ye Wuming,

12
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,400
I've told you many times.

13
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,480
Stop doing these pointless things.

14
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,200
No matter what you do,

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,400
it won't touch me,

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,880
nor change the fact

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,520
that I'm going to marry King Ling.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Lord Ye, what's the meaning of this?

19
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,600
If I cut off your face,

20
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,920
it'd make the most exquisite
leather mask.

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,680
Lord Ye,

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,200
this,

23
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,040
this really has nothing to do with me.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm innocent.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,840
I...

26
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,480
Stop!

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
Ye Wuming,

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,960
is this fun for you?

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
Master, you scold me because of him?

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
I did everything he asked,

31
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,640
but it only made you hate me more.

32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Let me tell you,

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,920
what makes me hate is not his methods.

34
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,920
It's you.

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
It's you yourself.

36
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Palace Master,

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,560
Lord Ye indeed
has deep feelings for you.

38
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
You don't know.

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Lord Ye personally made

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,120
each one of those sky lanterns.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,840
Inside them were fireflies

42
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,160
he sought through sleepless nights.

43
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,560
Not to mention

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,160
a person as aloof as him,

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,480
came to me every day to ask

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,400
how to smile.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,520
Enough, stop talking.

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,040
I know.

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,440
I've always known.

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
Do you know why you lost?

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,640
You don't even know

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,840
what your master truly wants.

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,560
But my brother knows.

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,680
That thing is now in my brother's hands.

55
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm with my master day and night.

56
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Your brother can't compare to that.

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,520
So what if you're together
day and night?

58
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,280
Do you know her?

59
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,680
Do you know what she's thinking?

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,240
Have you experienced joy and sorrow?

61
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,560
Do you understand what love is?

62
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,920
You know nothing at all.

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,000
Ye Wuming,

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,920
you're just a numb
and cold-blooded person.

65
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,760
How could you possibly understand

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,200
a woman's heart better than my brother?

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,400
What's your purpose in telling me this?

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,480
Perhaps

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,640
I can't bear to see that wicked woman

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,960
marry my brother so easily.

71
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,800
Don't you wonder

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,240
what your master wants?

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,760
Then tell me,

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,920
what does she want?

75
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,520
I didn't expect Your Highness

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,320
to keep such a secret.

77
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,880
You shouldn't come to this place.

78
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,560
Feeling sick?

79
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,840
This is the poison of Ten-day Love.

80
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,480
You were poisoned the moment
you stepped in.

81
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,400
I came to find Your Highness

82
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
to ask for something.

83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
What right do you have

84
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,320
to ask me for anything?

85
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,200
Don't!

86
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,400
The Seven-Colored Star.

87
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
Your Highness had Nangong Jue
kill so many people

88
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,480
just to gather these seven.

89
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,120
I can destroy it anytime.

90
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,600
This is who I am.

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,240
If you touch it,

92
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
I'll kill you right now.

93
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,680
Your Highness may torture me,

94
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
but if I destroy it,

95
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,920
it won't be so easy for you
to gather them again.

96
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Ye Wuming,

97
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,600
are you sure about this?

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
Is it worth it?

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
Give me that thing.

100
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,080
Ye Wuming,

101
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
where did you go?

102
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
This is what you

103
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,000
have been longing for.

104
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,440
I brought it for you.

105
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,840
This is...

106
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,080
Where did you get it?

107
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,320
Did you go to Tian Yuxue?

108
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
Ye Wuming.

109
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,000
What's wrong?

110
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,240
