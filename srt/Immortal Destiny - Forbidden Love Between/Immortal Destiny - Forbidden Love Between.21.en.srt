4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,920
Lu Ning.

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,360
Lu Ning.

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,080
Lu Ning.

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,120
Lu Ning.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,880
Lu Ning.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,040
No way.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,600
No way.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,680
You promised me.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
You said you'd stay with me.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,880
Why?

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,360
Why?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I knew it.

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,320
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,840
You'll wake up.

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,760
I'll bring you back.

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,840
Ning,

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
just bear with it a bit.

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
Forced teleportation will hurt a bit.

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,640
It'll be over soon.

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,160
I'm back?

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,360
Didn't you want to talk to the Bureau?

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,480
I got in touch with Wu Ce.

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,520
He helped pull you out.

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Wu Ce?

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,800
Where is he?

29
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,600
I want to see him.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,760
I want to save Ye Wuming.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,120
Ning,

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,320
it's useless.

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
The Security Bureau won't listen to you.

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,320
Then what about Ye Wuming?

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,680
What will happen to Ye Wuming?

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,920
Ning.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,080
Ce.

38
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,880
Lu Ning,

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,960
are you OK?

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,400
Are you really going
to completely delete him?

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
I can explain for him.

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,400
Enough.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,320
After you came back,

44
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,040
in order to awaken you,

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,040
he became even more brutal than before.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,040
That world has fallen into chaos.

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,280
Ye Wuming,

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
I did everything you asked.

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
Can't you spare us now?

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,520
Give me all the life-prolonging elixirs.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,000
Ye Wuming,

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
since you last destroyed my sect,

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
we barely managed to rebuild.

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,440
Why are you here again?

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
I only want the Wuji Grass.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
Give me the Wuji Grass.

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
As long as Your Highness spares my clan,

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,240
I'll give you whatever you want.

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,800
Tell me all the methods
of summoning souls.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,480
It's all my fault.

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,720
I made him like this.

62
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
Tian Yuxue was right.

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
If he falls into endless calamity,

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,880
it's all because of me.

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,880
Lu Ning,

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,320
stop thinking about it.

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,960
He's just a virtual person.

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,240
How can I not think about it?

69
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
It's my fault.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,280
It's too late now.

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,920
Saying these won't help.

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,640
Lu Ning.

73
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,520
I need to go back.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,600
What did you say?

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
Let me go back and delete him.

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,800
Apart from me,

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,880
no one can get close to Ye Wuming.

78
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,440
Your people

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
will only end up dying in vain.

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm the only one

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,520
he trusts unconditionally.

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Ce,

83
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
please apply for me.

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,160
Wait a moment.

85
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Your Highness,

86
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
the Xuanling Clan is now in chaos.

87
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,840
All other clans are eyeing us greedily.

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,920
What does that have to do with me?

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
You're the king of the Xuanling Clan.

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,600
I seized the throne

91
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,880
not for the sake of the world.

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
Leave.

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,600
Light two more lanterns.

94
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,520
She's afraid of the dark.

95
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,960
Yes.

96
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,880
I killed so many innocent people

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
and caused chaos throughout the realm.

98
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,600
Why haven't you woken up yet?

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
Wake up and scold me.

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,120
Your Highness.

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
What is it?

102
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
The queen...

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,080
The queen...

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
What happened?

105
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,120
I just left for a moment.

106
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,640
Didn't I order you to guard her

107
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
by her side?

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,680
I don't know.

109
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,320
Just now, all the candles in the chamber
suddenly went out.

110
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
When I lit the lanterns again,

111
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,800
the queen had already disappeared.

112
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,240
Your Highness, spare my life.

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,560
Don't kill me.

114
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,200
(Lu Ning.)

115
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,280
(Ye Wuming.)

116
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,480
(You're not dreaming.)

117
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,280
(I'm back.)

118
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,240
(During the time I was gone,)

119
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
(what exactly did you do?)

120
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
(I know what I did was wrong.)

121
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,720
(But you said,)

122
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,200
(you forbid me from making mistakes.)

123
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,240
(So I thought)

124
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
(as long as I keep making mistakes,)

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,240
(perhaps you'd come back,)

126
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,520
(and scold me.)
