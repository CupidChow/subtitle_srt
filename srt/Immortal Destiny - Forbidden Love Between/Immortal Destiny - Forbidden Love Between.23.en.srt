00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,360
Lu Ning.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,000
Ye Wuming,

6
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
it's you, right?

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,160
Lu Ning,

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,000
listen to me.

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,960
Go back immediately.

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,920
Don't stay here.

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,040
What's going on?

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
All the clans are attacking.

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,520
The immortals and demons

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,600
are all coming at us.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
Let me out.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,440
I beg you.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,400
Go away.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,600
Don't come back again.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,280
Hurry up and go.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,880
Ye Wuming.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,920
Ye Wuming.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't want to go.

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,600
Let me out.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,280
Ye Wuming.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
Tian Yuxue.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
You must've been

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,200
waiting for me for a long time.

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,640
While Ye Wuming was busy

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,680
saving the world,

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,640
my old followers broke into the dungeon

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,440
and rescued me.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,280
What?

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,760
You've become the queen.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
You don't even bother
pretending anymore?

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,200
I haven't come looking for you,

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
yet you deliver yourself to me.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,400
Have you forgotten

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,120
how your father died?

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
I forgot to mention,

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,320
Ye Wuming

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,760
is also in my hands.

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,840
On stormy nights,

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,600
my spiritual power is strongest.

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,520
Why haven't you left yet?

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
It's still not too late
if you go now.

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,040
I told you,

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,360
I came back

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
to be with you.

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,120
Enough.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,880
No need to act lovey-dovey
in front of me.

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
You probably don't know.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,360
Although Ye Wuming removed
the Love-cutting Bug,

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,440
the poison has already
penetrated his bones.

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,640
His spiritual power is only a tenth
of what it used to be.

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Thanks to you,

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
I no longer need to rely on his meridian

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,320
to defeat him.

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,400
Ye Wuming,

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,640
ever since I was young,

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,160
father left my mother and me

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,320
for your mother.

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
The first time I saw you,

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,320
I hated you to the core.

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,040
You took away my father,

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,240
my queen,

66
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,520
destroyed my beloved woman,

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,680
and even snatched my throne.

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Why?

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,720
I possess the purest bloodline
of the Xuanling Clan.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
You, a demonic bastard,

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:05,640
snatched my throne.

72
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,440
What qualifications do you have
to be the king?

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,280
Now,

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,000
you'll watch your beloved woman die

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,520
with your own eyes.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Lu Ning.

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,000
There's not much time left.

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
She wouldn't really be foolish enough

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,640
to stay there, would she?

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
By the way,

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,360
this world is so dangerous.

82
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,080
Haven't you thought
about shutting it down?

83
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,560
Five years ago when Lu Ning's dad died,

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
we did consider it.

85
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
But then the data returned to normal.

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,200
Returned to normal?

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't think I don't know.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,760
Back then, a guy hacked in

89
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,000
and then fell into a coma.

90
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,400
You suppressed that incident, right?

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,720
That guy is an expert in our area.

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,520
You didn't open a channel,

93
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,960
so he hacked his way through.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,200
If he weren't still in a coma,

95
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
perhaps we could ask him for help.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,240
What was that guy's name again?

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
Xu...

98
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
Yi...

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,880
Chi...

100
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,760
Lu Ning.

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,880
Lu Ning.

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,960
Ye Wuming,

103
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,080
you're always the same in every life.

104
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
You refuse to beg for mercy
until the last moment.

105
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,120
Why?

106
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
If only you just begged me once.

107
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
Tian Yuxue,

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,160
I only have a tenth
of my spiritual power left.

109
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,960
But you forgot, we Demon Clan

110
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,120
are born with the ability
to gain strength

111
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
through Soul-consuming Art.

112
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,480
You're destroying yourself.

113
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,440
Ye Wuming.

114
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,360
Are you alright?

115
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,560
I'm fine.

116
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Why aren't you leaving yet?

117
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,920
Where do you want me to go?

118
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,920
Home.

119
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
Didn't you always want to go home?

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Didn't you say

121
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,640
this is my home?

I shouldn't have made you come back.

It was my decision to come back,

126
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
because I needed you.

127
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Ye Wuming,
