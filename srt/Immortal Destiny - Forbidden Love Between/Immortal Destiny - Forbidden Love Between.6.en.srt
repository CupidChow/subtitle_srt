Move again and you'll be dead.

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Ye Wuming.

6
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,000
Didn't you want to hear my answer?

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,320
Let me tell you,

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,280
I want to live.

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Ye Wuming, do you want to die?

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,080
Your Highness.

11
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
No!

12
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,920
Are you satisfied now?

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
I gave you a chance,

14
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
but you didn't cherish it.

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,360
Now,

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
I'm going to let Ye Wuming die.

17
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,680
Your Highness!

18
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,080
I failed to find the Wuji Grass.

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,760
It's my fault.

20
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm willing to trade my life

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,320
for his.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,040
If Your Highness

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
dares to harm my master again,

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,466
even if it means
tearing my heart apart,

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
I'll kill you.

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,760

My blood.

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
What?

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,400
I don't want it.

38
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
You've been poisoned.

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,760

Ye Wuming,

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
don't ever let me
drink your blood again.

43
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
This is

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,840
very cruel.

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,080
What do you mean by "cruel"?

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880
Right,

47
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,280
you don't even understand
what cruelty is.

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,720
You can't comprehend death,

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,480
nor can you understand emotions.

50
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,520
What are emotions?

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,520
Simply put,

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
if you hate someone,

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,560
you'd want to kill them.

54
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,080
If you love someone,

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,280
you'd want to protect them.

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,960
(In your current state,)

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,022
(it'd be easier to stab you
than to use poison.)

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
(Be careful.)

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
(I can't let you die.)

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360

61

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,520
So, you saved me many times

63
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
because you love me?

64
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
I didn't say that.

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,080
What do you want?

66
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,320
The Fox Clan has many medicines.

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,280
I'll find an antidote for you.

68
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,160
I won't let anything happen to you.

Ye Wuming,

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,440
will you keep me company today?

71
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I'm scared.

72
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
Ye Wuming,

73
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
am I useless?

74
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,600
I couldn't even save a child.

75
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360

76
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,560

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,720
Are you still upset about
what happened earlier?

87
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,822
Don't you think something's off

88
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,720
about Hei Lian?

89
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,200
You never cared for
that wicked woman anyway.

90
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
She's changed her behavior

91
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600
and stopped bothering you.

92
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,360
Isn't that good?

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,920
That's exactly what concerns me.

94
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,440
People don't just

95
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,600
suddenly change their nature,

96
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,080
especially Hei Lian.

97
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,160
Moreover,

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
do you really think

99
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,000
she could be so easily
controlled by you?

100
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,480
She single-handedly

101
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,111
wiped out the entire Ye Clan
in the past.

102
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,160
That makes sense.

103
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,040
There's indeed
something fishy about this.

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,840
What if...

105
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,960
This wretch is a lunatic.

106
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Instead of

107
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,600
confronting her directly,

108
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,360
why not

109
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,720
turn them against each other?

110
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,000
What do you plan to do?

111
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,400
You need the Nine Souls Elixir?

112
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,488
Even your blood couldn't detoxify it.

113
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
The poison Tian Yaoge used

114
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
is quite vicious.

115
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,400
I won't let her get away with it.

116
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,120
Thank you.

117
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,320
Ye Wuming,

118
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
about that day...

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,920
What?

120
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
That day I didn't kill you.

121
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
Are you curious?

122
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,200
No,

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
I just wanted to ask,

124
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,320
if you're OK with that day.

125
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,440
At that time, I was at a loss.

126
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
But later I realized,

127
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,280
your blood

128
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,800
could detoxify common poisons, right?

129
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,360
You must have used it on her.

130
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,960
It was too late.

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,840
Too late?

132
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
How could it be too late?

133
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,440
Ye Wuming,

134
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,400
