00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,420
=Episode 17=

4
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,440
You and I are alike.

5
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
We both have a taste
for admiring our spoils.

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,760
I'm nothing like you.

7
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,680
Do you deny it?

8
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,880
Ever since you reclaimed your meridian,

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,560
you've been doing
exactly what I once did.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,600
You imprisoned me
as I once imprisoned you.

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,880
You massacred every clan,

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,360
making them submit to you.

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,800
You aim to prove to the Ninth Heavens

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,960
that you can replace me.

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,480
Do you think

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,800
they'd be willing to change your fate?

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,240
Dream on.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,200
Tell me,

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,480
how did you make Liu Rushuang

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,200
marry you willingly back then?

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,160
What,

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,400
she doesn't want to marry you?

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,960
Tell me!

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Why would I tell you that?

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,320
Unless

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,600
you sacrifice everything,

27
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
and return what is mine to me.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Ye Wuming, how far are you willing

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,280
to go for her?

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,800
I'll find my own way.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
You understand nothing.

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
Even if you possess everything of mine

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
and know the Ninth Heavens' secrets,

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
what does it matter?

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
Ye Wuming,

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,040
you're doomed to be alone.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,360
Alone!

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,280
Tian Yuxue,

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
I'll kill you.

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Lu Ning.

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,920
Ye Wuming.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,080
Ye Wuming.

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Ye Wuming.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,120
Ye Wuming.

45
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,240
Ye Wuming.

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,760
Ye Wuming.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,040
Ye Wuming.

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,760
Ye Wuming.

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
Lu Ning.

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,360
Didn't I say the candles
should stay lit here?

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Where are the candles?

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,960
All of you...

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,320
Don't kill anyone.

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,240
I wanted to have some quiet time.

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,440
I told them not to guard over me.

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,520
Everyone, leave us.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,960
Ye Wuming,

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,320
I had a dream.

59
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,640
I dreamt I killed you.

60
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,200
I was scared.

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,560
Don't be afraid.

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,160
I'm here with you.

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,760
Can you promise not to kill again?

64
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
Otherwise, they won't spare you.

65
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,920
Are you afraid I'll die?

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
(What am I saying?)

67
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,130
(Why would I say that?)

68
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
I promise you,

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
from now on, I won't kill again.

70
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,760
Ning.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Hei.

72
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
The candles went out.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,280
Did you do that?

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
I just wanted to see

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
if something happened to you,

76
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,560
how fast he could get here.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,440
Three seconds.

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,400
Coming from Xuantian Palace,

79
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,080
he's faster than I thought.

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
Right now, following him

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,160
ensures your survival.

82
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
Don't test him lightly.

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,240
He'll notice.

84
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,560
I received info,

85
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,800
the System Security Bureau
has decided to delete him.

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,800
This isn't his fault.

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
It's all because of me.

88
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
You know

89
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,640
they only look at data.

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,080
(What do I do?)

91
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
(I can't wait any longer.)

92
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
(I must get out.)

93
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,480
Going to deliver food again?

94
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,040
Yes.

95
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,840
King Ling is quite miserable.

96
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,960
Not only did King Ye spare him,

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
but King Ye also forced him to watch

98
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,920
his beloved woman turn to dust.

99
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,640
Keep your voice down.

100
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,840
You'll die if someone heard you.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,640
The torture King Ye inflicts

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,360
is truly worse than death.

103
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,160
All of you, leave.

104
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,280
You shouldn't be here.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,480
Ye Wuming,

106
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,200
how could you do

107
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
such an inhumane thing?

108
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,360
She's a person.

109
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
She's just a corpse.

110
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,600
Even corpses have dignity.

111
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Why should she endure
such humiliation from you?

112
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Dignity?

113
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,920
For 20 years in the Xuanling Clan,

114
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,840
did Tian Yuxue ever grant me dignity?

115
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,080
If you hate Tian Yuxue, torment him.

116
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,960
Why torment a woman instead?

117
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
You're no man at all.

118
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
So this is

119
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,000
what I am in your eyes.

120
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
You are my fiancée,

121
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
yet this is how you see me.

122
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,480
I can cease being your queen
at any moment.

123
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
What did you say?

124
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,160
I said I don't want to
marry you anymore.

125
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,320
I despise you.

126
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,920
Let me go!

127
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,480
Don't move.

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't touch me.

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,720
If you don't want to end up
like Liu Rushuang,

130
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
don't move.
