00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,020
(Adapted from "System Forced Me"
written by Xiaomanyao)

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,420
=Episode 16=

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,320
Where is Rushuang?

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,560
Let me see her.

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,320
You'll see her.

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,840
You'll witness her wither, decay,

8
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,920
and turn to dust before your very eyes.

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,560
Ye Wuming,

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760
I'll kill you.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,400
I'll make you experience

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,160
all the pain you've caused me.

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,440
Ye Wuming,

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,520
you were never meant to have feelings.

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,320
But you did.

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,360
We're the same.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,000
Once greed sets in,

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,720
we desire possession

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,080
and scheme.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,400
Such a person

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,160
will only earn her hatred.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,720
When you lose her,

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,360
you'll empathize

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,600
with all my pain completely.

25
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,527
(Xuantian Palace)

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,040
(Where could he be hiding the bracelet?)

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Did you come looking for me?

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,920
Ye Wuming,

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
give me back what's mine.

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Give you back?

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,480
And then you'll leave me?

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,280
You know everything now.

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,440
In Tian Yuxue's secret chamber,

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,640
there are secrets of the Ninth Heavens.

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,320
I'll take you to a place.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
Follow me.

37
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,680
(According to the ancient texts
found in the secret chamber,)

38
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,480
(I've arranged all these for you.)

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,400
(Lu Ning,)

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,480
(I'll fulfill for you)

41
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,160
(everything from that world.)

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
(I can give to you)

43
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,800
(whatever you desire.)

44
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,840
(Don't worry.)

45
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,920
(I'll win the recognition
of the Ninth Heavens)

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,520
(in my own way.)

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
(Ye Wuming,)

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,960
(you won't be able to do it.)

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
(They say)

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,320
(to propose in the Ninth Heavens,
one must kneel.)

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
(I've knelt to you a thousand times.)

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,720
(But)

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
(this time, it means)

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
(something different.)

55
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,080
(Lu Ning,)

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,720
(I'll create a world for you.)

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,120
(If I can make the Ninth Heavens
accept me,)

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,880
(will you)

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,200
(stay)

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
(for me?)

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,200
(Lu Ning,)

62
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,880
(you need to be clear.)

63
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,520
(You two aren't from the same world.)

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,200
(Even if you accept his proposal,)

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,240
(it's just to temporarily appease him.)

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,440
(That's all.)

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,520
Palace Master,

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
you didn't know.

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,360
You were unconscious for several days.

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,360
King Ye

71
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,200
was guarding you,

72
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
refusing to eat or sleep.

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
I was worried he couldn't withstand it.

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,640
(He's done so much for me.)

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,000
(What should I do?)

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,520
Ning.

77
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,400
Hei,

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
you finally came.

79
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,040
Ning, are you alright?

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm fine.

81
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,120
Hei,

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,520
it was Tian Yuxue who killed my dad.

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,640
But now,

84
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,880
he is imprisoned by Ye Wuming.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,640
Ye Wuming is...

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,560
I've seen it all.

87
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Continuing like this will be dangerous
for Ye Wuming.

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,000
Breaking settings

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,480
will get him deleted by the system.

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,760
Can you help me find out

91
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
if there's any update
from the Security Bureau?

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,920
Has the system discovered anything?

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Don't panic.

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,680
I'll think of a way.

95
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,240
(I still need to find
the Teleportation Ticket.)

96
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,200
(Only then can I explain
to the Security Bureau.)

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Look at me now.

98
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,160
Aren't you pleased with yourself?

99
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
Do you hate Ye Wuming?

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,320
What ability do I have to hate him?

101
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,400
I can't even get close to him.

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,800
With so many bugs and poisons here,

103
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,160
is there any that can strip him

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,920
of his spiritual power?

105
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,280
You want to go against Ye Wuming?

106
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,880
What,

107
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,320
do you really want to avenge my brother?

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
You don't need to know my reason.

109
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
I just need you to give me

110
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,120
a poison like that.

111
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
You can't get close to him,

112
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,040
but I can help.

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,720
You really want to harm Ye Wuming?

114
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Ye Wuming,

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,960
you truly misplaced your affection.

116
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,640
Your beloved woman

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,320
wants to harm you.

118
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,960
I've been refining this bug
for a long time.

119
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,320
I'll teach you how to use it.

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,400
Why tell me all this?

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,920
After all, you're my half-brother.

122
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,280
No matter how much I hate you,

123
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,040
I don't want

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,640
that wicked woman to harm you.

125
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,040
If you don't want to harm me,

126
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,760
why give it to her?

127
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,360
She forced me.

128
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,000
If you wish,

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,280
I can destroy it remotely right now.

130
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,440
Do as she says.

131
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
What?

132
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
If she wants anything else,

133
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
just give it to her.
