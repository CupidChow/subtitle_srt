=Forbidden Love Between=

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,020
(Adapted from "System Forced Me"
written by Xiaomanyao)

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,420
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,560
Ye Wuming,

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,080
you also carry the bloodline
of our clan.

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,280
How dare you harm our people!

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,080
If not for her,

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,200
this battle would've begun long ago.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,760
Don't tell me you've forgotten,

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,640
your meridian

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,120
is still in my hands.

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,640
For years, Your Highness
has controlled my meridian

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,040
and tormented me repeatedly,

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,240
making me endure unbearable pain.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,080
I exchanged my demon essence

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,240
with the 12 witches
for a Mandala flower,

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,720
which could protect me
for a quarter of an hour.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,240
A quarter of an hour

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,640
is enough.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,160
I should even thank Your Highness

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,760
for retrieving the physical form for me.

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,120
So I didn't need

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,800
to go the Mystic Void Realm again.

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,240
Ye Wuming.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,040
Stop!

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,080
You can't do this.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,600
Why can't I?

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,200
Master, don't you want to be

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
the queen of the Xuanling Clan?

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
Then from today onwards,

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,360
I'll be the king of the Xuanling Clan.

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,880
You can't become the king
of the Xuanling Clan.

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Everything in this world

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,240
is predetermined.

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,400
You have no right to change it
as you please.

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
I have no right,

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,080
but I have the power.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,120
I have the power to make the whole world

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
bow at my feet.

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,000
This way,

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,160
I'll gain the right to be

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
with you forever.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,920
He doesn't know

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,880
you've been deceiving him all along.

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,720
In the end,

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
you'll still leave him.

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
What does he mean by that?

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,380
♪Gently caress your tearful eyes♪

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,080
Master,

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,360
you won't leave me, right?

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,320
I will.

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,360
Ye Wuming,

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm not your master.

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm from the Ninth Heavens.

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
I came to this world

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,800
to uncover the truth

57
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,960
and avenge my dad.

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,400
I saved you

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,360
and treated you well

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
just to make you fall in love,

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,880
so I could extract your divine pill.

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,680
I never had

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,240
any true feelings for you.

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,080
From the first time I met you,

65
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,240
I was using you.

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,120
Now I know

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,920
Tian Yuxue is the one

68
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,680
who killed my dad.

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,080
So Ye Wuming,

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
after I destroy his divine pill
and avenge my dad,

71
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,880
I'll return to the Ninth Heavens.

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
You didn't deceive me.

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
I knew from the beginning
you weren't Hei Lian.

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
It was I who chose to turn a blind eye.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,080
It was I who deceived myself.

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm not worthy of your sacrifice.

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,920
We belong to different worlds.

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,360
No matter what you do,

79
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,240
I can never be with you.

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,800
So Ye Wuming,

81
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,520
I beg you,

82
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,400
don't continue on this path.

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
Return to your rightful place.

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
I beg you

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,280
to become the Ye Wuming you used to be.

86
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,040
The Ye Wuming I used to be?

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
I can't be the Ye Wuming
I used to be anymore.

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,560
I've always been

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,280
a cold-blooded monster.

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,800
I only know killing.

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
It was you

92
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
who taught me what love is,

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,400
and gave my life yearning and hope.

94
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,480
You turned me into who I am today.

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,680
But after giving me all this,

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,840
you want to leave just like this?

97
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
How can you do that?

98
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,280
I'll hide King Ling

99
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,200
somewhere you can never find.

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
I want you to never get your revenge.

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
I don't care who you are,

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
or where you come from.

103
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,080
I want you

104
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,120
to spend lifetimes

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
in this world

106
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,440
with me.

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Master.

108
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm not your master.

109
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,240
My name is Lu Ning.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,240
Lu Ning.

111
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
Lu Ning.

112
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,880
Ye Wuming,

113
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,320
I want to go home.

114
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,800
Home?

115
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,120
From now on, this will be your home.

116
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,080
You're not allowed to leave.

117
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
Stay here and be my queen.

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
I've already put away

119
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,800
the dangerous blade for you.

120
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
From now on, I'll protect you.

121
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,640
You don't need those anymore.

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,920
You're truly mad.

123
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,720
You never looked at me this way before.

124
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,240
That was all fake.

125
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,160
I'm tired.

126
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,720
I don't want to act with you anymore.

127
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Then we won't act.

128
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,040
You must be hungry.

129
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,480
I'll have them serve your meal.

130
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,360
(Yes,)

131
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,640
