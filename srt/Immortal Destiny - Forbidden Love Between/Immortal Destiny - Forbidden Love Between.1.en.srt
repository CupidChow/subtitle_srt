00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,000
(Ye Wuming.)

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,560
(I love you.)

(Lu Ning.)

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,320
(Ye Wuming!)

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,640
Are you pitying me?

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,760
I'm going to kill you.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,240
(I dreamed my master wanted to kill me.)

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,680
(We're from two different worlds.)

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,080
(No matter what you do,)

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,840
(I can never be with you.)

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,240
Why didn't you tell me?

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,880
(I won't let you go.)

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,640
(I won't let you marry him either.)

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,560
(Ye Wuming!)

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,840

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,360
Ning.

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,640
(Hei)

25
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,640
The entrance
to the virtual channel is open.

26
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,080
Once you go in,

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,680
remember to protect yourself.

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,600
(Ye Wuming is the most dangerous)

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,800
(virtual person in that world.)

30
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,133
(Are you sure you want to go?)

31
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,040
(Of course.)

32
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,080
(My dad died there five years ago.)

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,520
(He was the last one to contact my dad.)

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,480
(Now that we know)

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,840
(every virtual person)

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,160
(has a data chip inside,)

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,720
(I need to find his chip)

38
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,000
(and uncover the truth.)

39
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,000
(Hei Lian, Moon Palace)

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Where is Ye Wuming?

41
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,420
(Ye Wuming, Moon Palace)

Ye Wuming,

43
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,822
(Zhaoyao Sect)
how dare you wipe out my entire sect?

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,480
My...

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
My heart...

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,440
Give it

47
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,920
back to me...

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
(Ye Wuming,)

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
(the Palace Master summons you.)

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,320
(Return to the palace immediately.)

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,580

60
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,320

(Why isn't there any reaction?)

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Master,

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
I destroyed the Zhaoyao Sect.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,920
I deserve punishment.

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
But now that I've taken your stab,

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
isn't it enough?

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,680
Enough?

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,800
For someone who is cold-blooded

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,320
and kills the innocent like you,

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
one stab isn't enough.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,480
(Oh no,)

74
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,733
(I have no martial arts skills?)

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
I'll let you go today.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,920
But remember,

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,680
Ye Wuming,

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,680
you better behave yourself from now on.

79
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,720
Don't provoke me.

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,800
Keep kneeling here.

81
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,720
You can get up in four hours.

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,180
(Moon Palace)

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,500
(Lian Yi, Moon Palace)

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,560
How dare you!

85
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Ning, it's me, Hei.

86
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,960
Hei,

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,800
why are you here?

88
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,520
I forgot to say.

89
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
You can't get the chip out with a knife.

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,360
You need this.

91
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,560
What is it?

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,160
This ring can scan and locate the chip

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,080
inside a virtual person

94
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
and extract it.

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,480
Ning,

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,960
I can only enter Lian Yi's body briefly.

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,280
Be very careful.

98
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
I'll remind you again.

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,560
If Ye Wuming finds out
you're not Hei Lian,

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
he'll kill you.

101
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:53,220
Spare me, Palace Master.

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Spare me!

103
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
Leave.

104
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
Yes.

105
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,640
(Ye Wuming is so dangerous.)

106
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,240
(How can I get close enough)

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,400
(to scan his body?)

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,240
(By the way,)
