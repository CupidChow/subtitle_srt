4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,320
Hei Lian.

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,520
What brings you

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,360
to my chamber so late at night?

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,080
I missed Your Highness

8
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,200
and couldn't help

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,680
but come to see you.

10
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,200
Really?

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,200
You miss me?

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,720
That truly is an honor.

13
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
Your Highness must be joking.

14
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,960
As your future queen,

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,840
missing you is only natural, isn't it?

16
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,240
It's just your wariness of me

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,920
truly hurts my heart.

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,800
We're about to be married.

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
Once the marriage contract is signed,

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,240
we'll share our meridians.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,760
Why would I be wary of you?

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,160
Since Your Highness is well,

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm relieved.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,240
I'll take my leave now.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,840
If you miss me so,

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,120
why the hurry to leave?

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,360
(The ring is reacting.)

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,200
(His chip is here.)

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,720
Since Your Highness
wishes to be with me,

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,280
why don't we get married sooner?

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,080
Good.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Let's sign the marriage contract now.

33
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,160
(As long as I can extract his chip,)

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
(I can uncover the truth.)

35
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,600
(I have to agree)

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
(to gain his trust.)

41
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,960
(I want to live.)

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,840
The Fox Clan has many medicines.

43
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll find an antidote for you.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
I won't let anything happen to you.

45
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,760
Ye Wuming,

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
am I so useless?

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,520
How can you be useless?

48
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,720
You saved me.

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
I know what people in love would do.

50
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,960
If I could also do it,

51
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,240
would you marry me?

Then next time,

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,240
I'll do better.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
(Ye Wuming.)

57
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,240
Master, you went to see King Ling again.

58
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Ye Wuming,

59
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,160
I didn't restrict you,

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
nor should you restrict me.

61
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,000
I just don't want you
to get close to him.

62
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,880
I've been engaged to King Ling.

63
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,920
What right do you have to demand me?

64
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
King Ling is cold and merciless.

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
He's tried to kill you several times.

66
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,320
You shouldn't be fond of him.

67
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Then what should I do,

68
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,040
be fond of you?

69
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,720
Aren't you also cold and merciless?

70
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm cold and merciless,

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,760
but I can also become less so for you.

72
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I don't need you to.

73
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,560
Right now, I'm in no mood
to talk about this.

74
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,000
Let go of me.

75
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,280
I heard you talking with Lian Yi.

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,280
What?

77
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,320
(Does he know who I am?)

78
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,360
Master, you've been
using me all along, right?

79
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,880
Ye Wuming,

80
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,360
after my wedding with King Ling,

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
I'll set you free.

82
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,520
(You're not in love, are you?)

83
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
(How could that be?)

84
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,040
(Tell me,)

85
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,200
(how should he be punished?)

86
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,080
(Why don't we)

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,320
(give him a few lashes?)

♪Sharing a drink with you,
and watching the fireworks together♪

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,840
(Since he is the strongest
in this world,)

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,920
(then I should make good use of him)

91
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
(to protect myself.)

92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
(I won't get entangled
with him anymore.)

93
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,120
(I'll settle it
as soon as possible.)

94
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,420
(Xuantian Palace)

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,320
Hei Lian,

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,920
now this wretch follows you

97
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
even when you deliver a mere elixir.

98
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,760
Ye Wuming

99
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
serves me faithfully.

100
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,520
He's always by my side.

101
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
Soon you'll marry
into the Xuanling Clan.

102
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
What?

103
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
Is he to be part of your dowry?

104
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,760
If I marry Your Highness,

105
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,800
the Moon Palace's assassins

106
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,440
will follow Your Highness' command.

107
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
Let me serve you the medicine.

108
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,240
I see

109
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,920
the treasures on your shelf

110
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,400
seem to have changed.

111
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,400
You never cared for these things before.

112
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,120
The past is the past.

113
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
Now I'm about to marry you, Your Highness.

114
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,600
Of course I should care more

115
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,920
about the things in this chamber.

116
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
Your Highness, if I marry you,

117
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,760
you would want me

118
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,920
to live comfortably in this palace,

119
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,280

120
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,840

121
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
You have the final say.

122
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,840
Ye Wuming, let go of me.

123
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,080
Are you out of control
because I haven't lost my temper?

124
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
I told you

125
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
not to come to me again.

126
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,040
Stay away from me.

127
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,840
Let go of me.

128
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
