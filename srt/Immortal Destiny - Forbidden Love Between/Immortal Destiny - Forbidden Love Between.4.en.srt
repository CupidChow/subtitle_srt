(I'll use a double dose this time.)

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,040
(Maybe he'll sleep longer.)

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,600
Do you need me?

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,960
What are you doing?

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,200
Ye Wuming,

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,840
don't forget I'm your master.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,244
(What should I do?)

11
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,266
(Even my status of master
can't subdue him.)

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,680
Don't move.

13
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,480
If you do, I'll kill you.

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,560
Master, stop trying.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,520
The Hypnotic Incense doesn't work on me.

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
(It's so late.)

17
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:52,911
(Where is he going?)

18
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,780
(Firefly Forest)

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,120
(Prince of the Fox Clan?)

20
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,400
(What does Ye Wuming want with him?)

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,520
Ye Wuming,

22
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,040
after using the Eternal Talisman
for nine days,

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,240
your body has fully recovered.

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,880
Today,

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,520
I have a gift for you.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,360
Oh no.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,080
Watch out!

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,720
Ye Wuming.

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
Hidden weapon!

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,920
I know.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,360
I can't let you die...

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,760
Where is the antidote?

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,760
This...

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,280
This doesn't have one.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
You two need to...

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,955
The Love Needle has no antidote.

37
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,400
But once the poisoned wakes up,

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,960
they'll forget what happened.

39
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,280
Don't worry about her blaming.

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,800

Ye Wuming,

52
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,320
what are you doing here?

53
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,520
Master, do you remember
what happened last night?

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
Last night?

55
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:00,511
Last night, you fainted
in the Firefly Forest.

56
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
(Firefly Forest?)

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,520
So, you saved me?

58
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,640
Palace Master,

59
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,360
the boy toys
sent by Moonlight Pavilion

60
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,400
have arrived.

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,440
Boy toys?

62
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
(If I refuse,)

63
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:19,888
(he might think
something is wrong with me.)

64
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,080
Let them all in.

65
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,280
Palace Master,

66
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,040
what did you paint today?

67
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,720
A skin painting of birds and flowers.

68
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
Go back.

69
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,680
(What's with Ye Wuming today?)

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,280
(Why does he seem so strange?)

71
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,680
You,

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,320
come here.

73
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,960
(Is he suspecting)

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
(I'm not Hei Lian?)

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
(I hope I haven't been exposed.)

76
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Master, you aren't satisfied with them?

77
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,760
(Why does he sound so strange?)

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm not.

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,600
(What just happened?)

80
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,200
Who told you to kill him?

81
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,440
Master, you said

82
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,120
if you're not satisfied,

83
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,280
I should kill them for you.

84
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,800
You should assess the situation first.

85
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,360
They're so good-looking.

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,600
Can't I keep them to please my eyes?

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
I don't know how to do that.

88
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
I just follow orders.

89
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,680
If you want to keep them,

90
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,320
don't say you're not satisfied.

91
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
Really?

92
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,160
Ye Wuming,

93
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm not satisfied
with you right now.

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,640
Why don't you kill yourself?

95
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,600
Because you just taught me

96
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,360
to assess the situation.

97
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Fine.

98
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,200
Kneel there too.

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,800
Let me see

100
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,960
where the painting fits best.

101
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,720
Take off your clothes.

102
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,000
(Hei said)

103
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,480
(the greater a virtual person's
mood swings,)

104
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,680
(the stronger the chip signal would be.)

105
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,000
(He just killed someone)

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,360
(and then I humiliated him.)

107
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,880
(Will his emotions be more volatile?)

110

Ye Wuming, what are you doing?

111
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
They hate you.

112
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,560
If you don't kill them,

113
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
they'll kill you.

114
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
