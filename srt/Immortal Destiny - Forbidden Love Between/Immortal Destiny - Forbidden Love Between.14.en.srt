4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,160
So you've really met my dad?

5
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,960
You killed that man

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
from the Ninth Heavens?

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,600
He put Rushuang into a coma.

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,960
He deserved to die.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Tian Yuxue,

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,200
I'll kill you.

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,680
The ancient witches told me,

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,720
as long as I obtain

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
the major meridian
from the Ninth Heavens,

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
I can revive Rushuang.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,680
And finally, you came.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,360
Hei Lian,

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,240
you're also from the Ninth Heavens,

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,160
aren't you?

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,320
How could that be?

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,640
That's impossible.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,480
You've already signed
the marriage contract.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,320
Why can't I retrieve
your major meridian?

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,160
Master,

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,720
I destroyed the marriage contract.

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,640
You don't have to marry King Ling.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,320
No one will ever

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,720
be able to harm you.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,760
Ye Wuming,

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
I thought you...

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
Seize the throne?

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
No.

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,720
From the beginning,

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,680
I was only going to destroy
your marriage contract.

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Ye Wuming,

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
do you know what you're doing?

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,640
I do.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,440
Even if you defeat us,

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,800
you'll have to endure 99 thunder curses.

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,400
The pain of the thunder curse

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,040
far exceeds skinning and muscle pulling.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,440
No ordinary person can endure that.

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
You'll die.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
Even if I die,

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
I won't let anyone harm her.

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,680
Only by destroying
the contract

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,880
will she be free
from King Ling's control.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Fine.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
I'll grant your wish.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,920
Ye Wuming!

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,000
Ye Wuming,

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,320
how could you be so foolish?

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,840
You entered the Mystic Void Realm

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
not to retrieve your own meridian,

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,160
but to destroy the marriage contract.

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,480
This is the first time

56
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,480
someone cares about my life or death.

57
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,600
It was her,

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
who gave me dependence

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,360
and taught me what love is.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,320
For this bit of warmth,

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,560
I'm willing to give my life for her.

62
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,680
Tian Yuxue,

63
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,640
the contract has been destroyed.

64
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
You can no longer harm her.

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Ye Wuming,

66
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,280
I won't forgive you.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,040
This spiritual pool

68
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,480
can alleviate your injuries.

69
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
Ye Wuming,

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
how could you be so foolish?

71
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,640
You've endured
so much hardship and injury,

72
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
only for...

73
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,800
Stop it.

74
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,280
For you,

75
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm willing to do anything.

76
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,480
I knew Tian Yuxue made you
sign the contract

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
for a reason.

78
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240
So,

79
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,360
even if it means death,

80
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,800
I won't let him harm you.

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,120
No,

82
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,320
you can't kill him.

83
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,240
Hurry up and go!

84
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Why?

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
Because...

86
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,360
Because...

87
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,320
Because he is the king
of the Xuanling Clan.

88
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
He can't die like this.

89
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,920
I'll use my...

90
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,040
You protect him

91
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,120
because he's the king
of the Xuanling Clan?

92
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,080
I don't know how to explain it
to you now.

93
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,360
You can't kill him at this moment.

94
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,120
Then what if

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm the king of the Xuanling Clan?

96
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
What do you intend to do?

97
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,360
Ye Wuming, you can't!

98
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I can.

99
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
As long as you agree,

100
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,520
from this moment on,

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,760
I'll be the king of the Xuanling Clan.

102
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,480
Palace Master, you're finally awake.

103
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,640
Ye Wuming.

104
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,760
Then what if

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm the king of the Xuanling Clan?

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,600
No,

107
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,640
Ye Wuming,

108
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,560
you can't!

109
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
I promised you,

110
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
I'll give to you

111
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,160
anything you want.

112
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,360
No,

113
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,720
Ye Wuming, you...

114
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Where is Ye Wuming?

115
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
I don't know.

116
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,200
When I arrived at the palace,

117
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,760
you were the only one here.

118
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Palace Master.

119
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,620
(Ye Wuming,)

120
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,180
(you can't.)

121
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,740
(Forcibly altering your body)

122
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,980
(will get you destroyed by the system.)
