=Forbidden Love Between=

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,020
(Adapted from "System Forced Me"
written by Xiaomanyao)

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,420
=Episode 22=

4
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,360
Lian Yi,

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,360
what do you think of this painting?

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,600
She likes irises.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm Wu Ce.

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,120
I can only come in for a moment.

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,320
And this is the only time.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,680
So to make a long story short,

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,600
Ye Wuming,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you need to save Lu Ning.

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840
So,

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,800
if she doesn't delete me on time,

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,920
what will happen?

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
The Security Bureau

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,800
will restart the system.

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Once restarted,

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,200
she'll turn into Hei Lian,

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,520
and she can never return.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,320
Actually, the Security Bureau

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,080
is pushing her to do it.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,160
But I know,

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,600
asking her to delete you herself

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
is worse than death for her.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,480
The reason she chose to come back

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,080
was just to fulfill that promise,

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,480
to stay with you forever.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,440
So,

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,480
I need to make her go back

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
and do nothing.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,480
If I could make her hate me,

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
and force her to go back,

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,080
do you have a way

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,080
to make her completely forget about me?

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,800
(Ye Wuming,)

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,240
(I'm willing to stay
in this world with you,)

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,360
(no matter what happens.)

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
(Even if it means disappearing with you.)

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,840
(Because)

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
(I love you.)

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,300
(Safe)

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,840
Ye Wuming,

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,040
if killing is a sin,

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,160
then let me bear

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,520
this sin for you.

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,760
Ye Wuming,

48
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,840
I missed you.

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
I'm willing to trade my life

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,240
for his.

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,240
(Why save me?)

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
(I'm just a tool for killing.)

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600
(What does it matter if I die?)

54
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,160
(Ye Wuming,)

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,480
(you're not a tool; you're a person.)

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,440
(People should live.)

57
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,320
(Let me ask you,)

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,640
(do you want to live?)

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,400
(I know what someone in love would do.)

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
(If I could do the same,)

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,000
(would you marry me?)

62
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,280
(Ye Wuming,)

63
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,960
(how can you be so foolish?)

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,080
(For you,)

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,840
(I'm willing to do anything.)

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,960
(Lu Ning,)

67
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,320
(hate me.)

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
(Hate me enough to want to kill me.)

69
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,320
(The more, the better.)

70
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,560
(Let me end all this.)

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,080
(Let everything return
to the starting point.)

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,280
(Lu Ning,)

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,280
(let's pretend)

74
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
(we never met.)

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
You're back.

76
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,640
You're drunk.

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,840
Why don't you do it?

78
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
What?

79
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,240
Didn't you come back

80
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
this time to kill me?

81
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
You know everything.

82
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,280
Yes.

83
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,720
I know everything.

84
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,240
Lu Ning,

85
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
I slaughtered various clans,

86
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,160
collected rare treasures,

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,440
exerted myself to cast spells for you,

88
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,640
almost drained all my blood

89
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,880
to lay out the Soul-summoning Formation,

90
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,320
hoping for your return day and night.

91
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
And then?

92
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,640
You came back just to kill me

93
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,920
and make me disappear forever.

94
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
Speak.

95
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
Speak.

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,680
Why aren't you explaining?

97
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
I have nothing to explain.

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,960
What you said is right.

99
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
I came to kill you.

100
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,520
I gained your trust

101
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,400
and approached you,

102
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,720
all to make you disappear forever.

103
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,640
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

104
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
I don't want to act with you anymore.

105
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,960
I know you love me,

106
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
so I hope

107
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,040
to spend the rest of my life with you.

108
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,720
Let's happily spend

109
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,040
our last moments together,

110
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,480
and then

111
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,520
never part again.

112
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
Spend the last moments with me?

113
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,920
Who do you think you are?

114
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,280
Do you think I care?

115
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,320
What do you take me for?

116
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Are you trying to pity me?

117
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,160
Let me tell you, I don't need it.

118
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't need it.

119
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,760
Lu Ning,

120
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
in your eyes, have I always been stupid?

121
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,840
Whatever you did to me,

122
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
I was willing to fall into your trap.

123
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,920
You repeatedly tormented me,

124
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,160
betrayed me, left me,

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
and yet,

126
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,520
I couldn't bear to kill you.

127
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,160
I loved you with all my might.

128
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,760
So this time,

129
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,400
you don't even bother to lie to me.

130
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm truly despicable.

131
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,720
But not anymore.

132
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,440
I no longer have
any feelings for you,

133
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
not even pity.

134
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,160
Right,

135
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
aren't you afraid of the dark?

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,040
From today onwards,

137
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,160
I want you to fall
into endless darkness.

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,040
I will torment you,

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,720
and all of you from the Ninth Heavens.

140
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
If you have the ability,

141
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,880
kill me.

142
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,000
If you can't stand it,

143
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,680
please go back to your world.

144
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,080
Someone,

145
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,240
take her away.

146
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes.

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
Ye Wuming.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,080
Ye Wuming.

149
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,900
(Moon Palace)

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,480
Open the door.

151
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,320
Lian Yi.

152
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,600
Lian Yi.

153
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,840
Is anyone there?

154
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,160
Is anyone there?

155
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,280
So this is what real darkness

156
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
feels like.

157
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,320
Are you sure you want to do this?

158
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,040
You know,

159
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,760
I want to go back
not just for Ye Wuming.

160
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
I still have one thing left undone.

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,280
Tian Yuxue.

162
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,880
I know you won't spare him.

163
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,480
Let me remind you once more.

164
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,440
Don't act on emotions.

165
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
Make sure to delete Ye Wuming

166
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,720
before the system restarts.

167
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,760
Otherwise, once it restarts,

168
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,120
you'll forget everything here

169
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,080
and turn into Hei Lian completely.

170
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,080
He'll also lose this life's memories

171
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,880
and become the original Ye Wuming.

172
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,480
This is too tragic, isn't it?

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,960
Two people in love

174
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
will torment each other for eternity?

175
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,160
Ning,

176
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,680
don't be foolish.

177
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,440
There are less than three hours left.

178
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,680
There isn't much time left

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
for you.

180
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
(Lu Ning,)

181
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
(don't hesitate.)

182
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,680
(Break the bracelet)

183
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,040
(and you can go home.)
