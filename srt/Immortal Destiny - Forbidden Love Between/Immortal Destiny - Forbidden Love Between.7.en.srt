=Episode 7=

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,160
Ye Wuming,

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,200
have you developed feelings for her?

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,088
I didn't expect that...

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,240
I won't ask anymore.

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,120
It's all my fault.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Go save her now.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,040
He's obviously in love.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,320
Ning, have you lost your mind?

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,760
I just went to the bathroom,

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,320
but you almost got yourself killed.

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,680
Don't worry.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,120
I've checked the guide.

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
That spot is still two inches away
from the heart.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,688
That doesn't mean
you should take the risk!

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,320
This tactic seems quite effective.

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,840
He really seems moved.

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
He even traded his blood

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,080
for the Nine Souls Elixir for me.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,240
Lu Ning, I warn you.

23
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,400
If you keep acting recklessly,

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,720
I won't let you continue.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
I promised your dad
to keep an eye on you.

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,520
Don't worry.

27
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,622
(Xuantian Palace)

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,320
How dare you use
such a deadly method on my master!

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,120
I didn't.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,720
Shut up.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,440
Say one more word and you'll die.

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,160
Move again and you'll die too.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
If you understand me,

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,800
gather up your poisonous bugs.

35
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:40,977
Princess, do you know what it means
to be in unbearable pain?

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,880
If not,

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
open your eyes wide

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,880
and take a good look.

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,640
This is a Golden Silkworm Bug.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,320
Princess, just enjoy it.

41
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,760
(Golden Silkworm Bug,)

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
(the most vicious poison in the world.)

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,200
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,880
That wicked woman
threatened you that day.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,520
How could I bear that?

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Hei Lian destroyed his entire clan,

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,200
yet he'd still save her,

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,520
and even threaten you.

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,560
Maybe

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,520
Hei Lian has something else
to control him?

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
Impossible.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
Does Ye Wuming have feelings for her?

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
If that's true,

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,640
it'd be easier for us.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,880
That's not easy.

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
I can't tell you how
to win a woman's heart.

57
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,440
Our Fox Clan

58
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,320
never needs to win anyone's affection.

59
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,560
They come to us willingly.

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,560
Ye Wuming,

61
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,240
your Ye Clan was born without emotions.

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,240
Why are you suddenly interested in this?

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,888
Aren't you going
to seize the throne?

64
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,000
To seize the throne,
there must be killing.

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,720
She dislikes killing.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,320
You're willing to give up
the world for a woman?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Ye Wuming,

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,240
this isn't like you.

69
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,844
Forget it if you don't know.

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,080
If you really want to know,

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
ask Wuqing from Moonlight Pavilion.

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
He's an expert in these matters.

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,240
Wu Qing?

74
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,180
(Wu Qing)

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,333
(Wu Qing, Moonlight Pavilion)
Lord Ye, what do you mean by this?

76
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
No more boy toys

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,666
to the Palace Master from now on.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,600
No problem.

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
However,

80
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,040
if the Palace Master blames me...

81
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,120
No need to worry about that.

82
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,040
Tell me,

83
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,520
how to win a woman's heart?

84
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,480
Everyone knows

85
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,560
the Ye Clan was born without emotions.

86
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,320
I didn't know

87
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,640
you were interested in this.

88
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
Cut the crap.

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,640
Tell me,

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
how to please the Palace Master?

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,480
I have a thousand...

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,000
No. Ten thousand methods

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
to make a woman happy.

94
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,440
Speak.

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,840
What methods?

96
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
You came.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,244
Your Highness.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Hei Lian,

99
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,320
it's time for us to get married.

100
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,440
Get married?

101
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,720
You're my fiancée.

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,680
It's only right

103
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
for us to get married soon.

104
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,880
Your Highness's grand ambition
hasn't been achieved yet.

105
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
We're not in a hurry.

106
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,840
I'll take my leave first.

107
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm in a hurry?

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,666
Your Highness...!

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
(These beads look just like
the Teleportation Ticket.)

110
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,560
(Then...)

111
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,040
Are you interested in them?

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,960
How dare I covet
Your Highness's possessions?

113
00:06:58,288 --> 00:06:59,640
I've just never seen them before.

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,560
I'm just curious.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
Really?

116
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
No need to be curious.

117
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,800
Once we're married,

118
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,400
I'll grant you

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,240
whatever treasures you want.

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,400
Come here.

121
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,840
Try it on.

122
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,360
What?

123
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
Do you need me to summon that wretch

124
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,560
to help you change?

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,960
Your Highness, no need.

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,360
(If those beads really
are Teleportation Tickets,)

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,240
(could they belong to my dad?)

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
(But why are they
in Tian Yuxue's hands?)

129
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,600
(Could my dad's death)

130
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,440
(be related to him?)

131
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,444
Princess, what are you doing
at the Moon Palace?

132
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,760
Have you forgotten my warning?

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,120
You're so anxious about your master,

134
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
but your master is only
devoted to my brother.

135
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,920
I feel sorry for you.

136
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,120
You've tried to come between us
several times.

137
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
What exactly do you want?

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
Do you think I'd believe you?

139
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
My brother and your master
are getting married.

140
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
