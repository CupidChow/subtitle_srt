4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,320
They hate you.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,440
If you don't kill them,

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
they'll kill you.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
Master, do you want
to try killing someone?

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,120
Palace Master.

9
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,760
King Ling requests Ye Wuming
to go to the Xuantian Palace.

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,200
King Ling?

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,600
Why does he need Ye Wuming?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,280
It's said they found someone
from the Zhaoyao Sect.

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,880
Hei Lian,

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,320
you sent Ye Wuming
to destroy the Zhaoyao Sect,

15
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,920
causing me to lose the Wuji Grass.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,960
Now,

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,840
I give you a chance to redeem yourself.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
Bring the person up.

19
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:45,400
She's the only survivor
of the Zhaoyao Sect.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,280
(A child of Zhaoyao Sect)

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,200
Your Highness,

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,440
this child is too young

23
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,390
and probably doesn't know
where the Wuji Grass is.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
How about we just let her go?

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,480
Hei Lian,

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,080
when did you become so soft-hearted?

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,880
Tell me,

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,560
where is the Wuji Grass?

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,200
I don't know.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,920
You don't know?

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,840
Then there's no need for you to live.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Your Highness.

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,000
If we kill her,

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,320
we won't get any information.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Alright.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll give you three days.

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
If you can't find
the Wuji Grass in three days,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
both she and Ye Wuming will die.

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,400
(Looks like I need to find
the Wuji Grass first.)

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
(I can't let him kill Ye Wuming.)

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Sit here.

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
You really don't know
where the Wuji Grass is?

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,400
Miss,

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,960
will you kill me?

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
I won't kill you.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,000
Have you seen the Wuji Grass?

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,640
Do you know what it looks like?

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,680
I just joined the sect.

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,240
I haven't met the elders yet,

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,760
let alone the Wuji Grass.

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,360
Miss, I don't want to die.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Lian Yi.

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Here.

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,320
Palace Master.

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,880
Send her secretly to the Immortal Sect.

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,870
Don't let anyone find out.

57
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes.

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
Where is Ye Wuming?

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
Just now, King Ling

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,720
tortured him with his heart.

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
He came back from the Xuantian Palace
and went to his room.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,440
I see.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
Go ahead.

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,600
Yes, Palace Master.

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,440
Let's go.

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
(His punishment these two times)

67
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,440
(is also an undeserved disaster.)

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,080
Ye Wuming.

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Ye Wuming!

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Master, why are you here

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
so late?

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,240
I wanted to ask

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,080
if you know where the Wuji Grass is.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
If you want to find that,

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
just ask the girl.

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
If she doesn't speak,

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
then torture her.

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
Torture?

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you have no mercy?

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,400
She's just a child,

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,720
an innocent life.

82
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,880
Mercy?

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
You never taught me about mercy.

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Indeed.

85
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,760
You destroyed their entire sect.

86
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
Why would I talk about mercy with you?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,440
Hey,

88
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,160
Ye Wuming.

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,240
Hey.

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Ye Wuming.

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
He's burning up.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,520
Is his heart damaged so severely?

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
He won't die, will he?

95
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:20,300

97
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,520
What is this?

98
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,960
I don't want it.

99
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,520
Don't worry, it's not poisonous.

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,000
In your current state,

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
it'd be easier
to stab you than use poison.

102
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,120
I'm telling you,

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,520
it's an elixir
from the Ninth Heavens.

104
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,360
It can cure anything.

105
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,520
Be grateful.

106
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
Why save me?

107
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,640
I'm just a tool for killing.

108
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
What's the difference if I die?

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,200
Ye Wuming,

110
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
you're not a tool; you're a person.

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,640
A person should live.

112
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,400
Let me ask you,

113
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,720
do you want to live?

114
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,600
Hey.

115
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:18,880
Are you...

116
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,600
really cold?

117
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,640
Ye Wuming,

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
I don't allow you to die.

119
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,520
You absolutely mustn't die,

120
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
do you hear me?

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,080
I gave you the only elixir I have.

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
You better get well soon.

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Where did you go?

140
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:37,720
I've been waiting for you.

141
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,920
What about the thing I asked for?

142
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Time is tight,
so I could only find this.

143
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,400
See if it can pass for it.

144
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,600
This...

145
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
I told you to find the Wuji Grass.

146
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Isn't this just Perilla?

147
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,840
I checked the guide.

148
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,720
There's no Perilla in the virtual world.

149
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,920
Anyway, Tian Yuxue has never
seen the Wuji Grass.

150
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
We should be fine, right?

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,960
Is Tian Yuxue so easy to deceive?

152
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,520
You still need to try, right?

153
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,000
Alright then.

154
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,120
I have to hand it over today anyway.

155
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
I'll just have to try.

156
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,760
If it really doesn't work out,

157
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:11,480
I'll use
the Teleportation Ticket.

158
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,720
Alright.

159
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,860
I'll still say the same thing.

160
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,720
Stay safe.

161
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,280
If you fail, come back.

162
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,480
(If I can't deceive him,)

163
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,040
(Tian Yuxue will definitely
kill Ye Wuming.)

164
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,000
(I stayed with him all night.)

165
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,280
(If I can save him again today,)

166
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,640
(maybe it'll move him.)

167
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
This is the Wiji Grass?

168
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,120
Yuxue,

169
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
this isn't the Wuji Grass at all.

170
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Hei Lian,

171
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,920
you deceived me!

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,920
Your Highness, we caught her.

173
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,800
Miss, please help me!

174
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,760
Your Highness,

175
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,600
this child is too young.

176
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,480
She truly doesn't know
where the Wuji Grass is.

177
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,640
Keeping her would be a burden,

178
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,840
so I let her go.
