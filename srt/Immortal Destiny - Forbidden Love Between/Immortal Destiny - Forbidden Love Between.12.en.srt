00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
The King of the Xuanling Clan?

00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,320
Whatever he can give you,

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,040
I can as well.

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,200
Ye Wuming,

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,800
if you insist on this,

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,400
I'll have to kill you.

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,120
Master, you want to kill me for him?

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,280
Yes.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll kill you.

21
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,280
We've drunk each other's blood.

22
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,320
In the Moon Palace,

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,080
it's also a lifetime vow.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,040
Don't ever think about marrying him.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,560
Ye Wuming,

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,560
what do you want to do?

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
Didn't you want me to be myself?

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Then,

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,440
from today onwards,

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,600
everything I do

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
will have nothing to do with you.

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,560
Ye Wuming!

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,480
(Ye Wuming, don't act recklessly.)

34
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,260
(Xuantian Palace)

35
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
(Where is it?)

36
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Where is it?

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,520
I don't know.

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,280
You've been poisoned
by my Golden Silkworm.

39
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
If you don't tell me,

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,000
you'll taste the agony
of insects gnawing at you,

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,440
a feeling worse than death.

42
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,040
Let me ask you again, where is it?

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,560
My brother has sealed it

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,040
on the altar of the Mystic Void Realm.

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
Ye Wuming,

46
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
you've just been detoxified.

47
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,320
You can't withstand
the 99 thunder curses.

48
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,720
You'll die there.

49
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,360
Then I'll give your brother
a few more days.

50
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,880
You can't protect her.

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
You won't defeat my brother either.

52
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,360
I'll wait for the day
you suffer unbearably.

53
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,720
Though you've retrieved the bracelet,

54
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,320
it only proves

55
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,160
your dad had dealings with Tian Yuxue.

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,240
That's enough.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,760
As long as I get the chip...

58
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,880
Ning,

59
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,200
Tian Yuxue is very suspicious.

60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Don't force it.

61
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,520
(How can someone like Tian Yuxue)

62
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,520
(be made to obey willingly?)

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,080
Ye Wuming's blood

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,280
is the best material
for nurturing a Love Bug.

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
It seems I dreamed of you again.

66
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
Yes.

67
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
This is a dream.

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,320
You're lying to me again.

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,920
You told me to stop pestering you.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,560
Now you come to me
in the middle of the night.

71
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,120
What do you want?

72
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,840
I want your blood.

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
What are you going to exchange for it?

74
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,680
Other than

75
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
not marrying King Ling,

76
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,640
I can agree to

77
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,440
anything else.

78
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,040
Why do you need my blood?

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,160
That's none of your concern.

80
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,800
I only ask if you're willing
to give it to me.

81
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,960
This isn't how you ask for a favor.

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
Do you know what you're doing?

83
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,720
I do.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm asking you

85
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,880
to give me your blood.

86
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,480
This isn't enough.

87
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,400
It seems you really want my blood.

88
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,800
This time, it was you who came to me.

89
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,360
Don't say I'm pestering you.

I didn't expect,

96
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
in order to get my blood,

97
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,360
you'd go to such lengths.

98
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
Fine.

99
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,040
I'll give you my blood.

101
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,560

Today,

108
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,120
I didn't expect you to drink with me.

109
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,240
