1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,720
What are you two doing holding hands?!

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,220
Onodera.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,480
Senior! Why are youー

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,951
Who are these people?

5
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:09,891
And who the hell are you?

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,580
He's the President of our company, Mr. Mizukami.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,940
He takes care of me a lot.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,250
And he's...

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,690
Her future husband.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,691
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,141
He's just a relative.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm sorry about what happened today.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,650
You even made a reservation at such a lovely restaurant...

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,160
I was worried since you left so suddenly.

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,990
What happened?

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,350
That's because...

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,380
I called her.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,530
And you are...

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm...

20
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,400
I live in the apartment below hers.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,690
The roof was leaking so I called the realtors and asked them to contact her.

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,520
What? What are you talking about?

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
A leak? Is everything okay?

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,760
The roofer will be coming tomorrow morning, so no need to be concerned.

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,780
That's what happened.

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,400
In that case, that's a relief.

27
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,837
Well then, we're headed off to the convenience store to buy dinner.

28
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:17,208
Huh? Wait what are you-

29
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,314
We'll be on our way now.

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,470
Things must've been tough.

31
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,560
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,700
No it's fine, I actually have to apolog-

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,200
Stop.

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:38,400
If you apologize any more it'll be hard for me to invite you again.

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,200
Huh? The 3 of them met?

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,680
Well then? Did they fight it out?

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,850
Unfortunately, nothing of that sort happened.

38
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,790
Gosh, why?

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,520
Hikaru managed to get his way out of it.

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,340
Said he lived downstairs and called me because there was a leak.

41
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,240
It's not like I could say the boyfriend I have a love contract with called me.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,270
Seems like Hikaru realized that too and went along with it.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,850
Yumeko, you've been calling him Hikaru today.

44
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,220
Something must've happened, right? You're so obvious.

45
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,550
N-Nothing at all...

46
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,350
What? What is it?

47
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,870
Answer that.

48
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,421
Okay, okay. Fine.

49
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,890
Huh?

50
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,640
- Yumeko.
- What?

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,050
Jinguji's here.

52
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,440
You really do resemble him.

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,370
Do I really look that much like Yumeko's first love Jinguji?

54
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,970
Honestly, it's like you're two peas in a pod.

55
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,820
But it must not feel that great being told that you look like someone else, right?

56
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,101
But thanks to this face I was able to grow closer with Yumeko.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,250
Until the contract is over please continue to stay close with Yumeko.

58
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:19,790
Whenever I see Yumeko's smiling face a smile also comes to my face as well.

59
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,560
Just thinking about where we'll go next,

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,620
what we'll do or eat together next...

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,020
Just thinking about those things is fun

62
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,430
and makes me feel happy inside.

63
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,120
What are you two talking about?

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,820
That's a secret.

65
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,530
Looks like we'll need more wrappers.

66
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,330
I'll go buy some, you two keep wrapping.

68
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:59,106
Thanks for explaining to Mizukami yesterday

69
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,200
so things didn't end awkwardly.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,790
No, I actually have to thank you.

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,410
You came even when you had important plans with him.

72
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,210
Yumeko.

73
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,630
I have something I need to tell you...

74
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,650
Sorry.

75
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,100
Tomomi? You forgot your wallet?

76
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,800
Okay, I'm coming.

77
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,030
Sorry, what were you saying?

78
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,750
Nothing.

79
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,630
I'll tell you next time.

80
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,780
Okay, I'll go deliver this then.

81
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,010
This is...

82
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,700
You had said you wanted to open a café

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,240
where people could enjoy the desserts available on our website
<i>["Life with Sweets. Coffee" 2019 New Business Project - Yumeko Onodera]</i>

84
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,290
with a curated selection of coffee and tea, right?

85
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,370
You remembered this project?

86
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,160
I never forget good ideas.

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,550
I know you're already busy with the existing projects

88
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,915
but what do you think? Want to give it a try?

89
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,370
Yes, please.

90
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,320
Are we opening a café? That's amazing.

91
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,740
We sure are going to get busy again.

92
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,240
Please let me know if there's anything I can help with.

93
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,840
Thank you.

94
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,200
First of all, we'll have to find a location.

95
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,850
Let's all work hard together.

96
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,208

105
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,970
As expected, you sure take great photos.

106
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,050
Should I just post these publicly?

107
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,620
There's still some time until I turn 25 and retire

108
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,420
but I need time to prepare to become a housewife too...

109
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,539
There you go again. We're just childhood friends.

110
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,880
I told you we're more like comrades, right?

111
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,870
I'm serious.

112
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,800
Oh right, here you go.

113
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,900
A birthday present.

114
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,710
Let's have tea at a café, head to a museum and then go shopping.

115
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,710
But if people find out, it'll cause a commotion...

116
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,400
It's okay, I'm good at disguises.

117
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,470
Okay.

118
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,460
Hikaru?

119
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,430
I'm sorry I couldn't be with you on your birthday.

120
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,030
You had work, it's okay.

121
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,209
But every year we always celebrate and have cake together.

122
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,728
I did have cake

123
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:55,460
and celebrated too, so don't worry.

124
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,300
You were with that person?

125
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,450
Yes.

126
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,050
Okay, I'll start with cleaning and laundry.

127
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,642
You have to close it after opening it.

128
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,411
They teach you that in elementary school, didn't they?

129
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,370
What's this?

130
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,077
Thanks for waiting, Toma.

131
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,737
What's going on?

132
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:45,947
Take a seat.

133
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,067
What's this about?

134
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:54,377
Yumeko.

135
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:57,670
What's this?
<i>[Contract of Employment]</i>

136
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,080
<i>[Contract of Employment]</i>

137
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,097
Are you in a love contract with him?

138
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:05,177
That's...

139
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:08,997
If you lie to me, I'll make you a super bitter smoothie.

140
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:13,027
Fine.

141
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,957
You're right.

142
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:18,677
You must've been really lonely, Yumeko.

143
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:22,587
If I had come to you earlier, this wouldn't have happened.

144
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,907
Not exactly...

145
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:27,657
Once he repays you and the contract ends

146
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:30,937
the two of you will no longer be lovers then, right?

147
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,267
Don't tell me you're in love with him or anything...

148
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,577
No way!

149
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:42,267
This is all just child's play.

150
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:46,007
You can only start a relationship if you have a future with someone, right?

151
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,757
There's no way things can get serious when the end's already been predetermined.

152
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:50,447
You're right.

153
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:54,547
A relationship without a future is pointless.

154
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,317
Exactly.

155
00:08:56,317 --> 00:09:00,027
Like you said, once the contract ends our relationship is over.

156
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:02,069
We'll become strangers again.

157
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:04,567
I'll believe you.

158
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:08,057
All right, you must be hungry, right?

159
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:09,787
I'll warm up the food, so just wait a minute.

160
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:12,307
It's pot-au-feu with herbs.
<i>(T/N: pot-au-feu - a French soup of meat and vegetables)</i>

161
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:17,477
It'll be done real soon so get ready, okay?

162
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,407
I'm going on my break.

163
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,637
What? Wait-

164
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:31,667
Is there an aroma oil to make a couple break up?

165
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,517
Do you think I'm a shaman or something? Of course not!

166
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,657
Are you really doing your job?

167
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:39,127
Those two don't seem like they're breaking up anytime soon.

168
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:40,827
You're useless.

169
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:44,257
If you can't even make the man you like fall in love with you

170
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:46,317
then it's kind of embarrassing to call yourself an idol, right?

171
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:49,697
I've already decided I'm not going to confess until I turn 25.

172
00:09:49,697 --> 00:09:52,047
You don't understand this professionalism-

173
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,497
Hold up. Hold up.

174
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:55,497
Let's stop this meaningless bickering.

175
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:59,417
Those two are going to break up soon anyways.

176
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,779
What do you mean?

177
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:07,677
Those two have a love contract.

178
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,526
Thanks for the hard work.

179
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:21,577
How's the café project coming along? Any news?

180
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:27,837
Actually... I'm worried if I can do a good job...

181
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:32,547
It's rare to hear you say something like that.

182
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:35,547
It's my first time working on a project involving a physical store.

183
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,697
And I want to meet your expectations.

184
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,067
Onodera.

185
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:46,907
It's okay if you fail, I'll be here to help you.

186
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:52,394
Don't forget that your greatest supporter is right here.

187
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:55,197
Okay.

188
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,997
I'll rely on you then.

189
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,807
I'm also relying on you.

190
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:07,200
I feel reassured with you around.

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,017
Bet you didn't know that.

192
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:10,697
Senior...

193
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:16,567
That's why I feel relieved whenever I see your smile in the office

194
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,437
and I get worried about you feeling tired.

195
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:27,057
I don't know how to speak in circles so I'll just say it.

196
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,677
Onodera.

197
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,737
Would you like to go out with me?

198
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:43,297
<i>Seems like I've caught a cold from the shock of the sudden confession.</i>

199
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:50,737
<i>I've been feeling sick since this morning can I take the day off?</i>

200
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,217
<i>[Senior Mizukami]</i>

201
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:58,897
He must've been serious.

202
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:16,137
"When the 50,000 yen is repaid, this contract shall be annulled."

203
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:21,127
I have to go buy medicine.

204
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,300
<i>[Cafe.Doruuchan1897: House Special Lunches changes daily.]</i>

205
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:39,826
Hikaru?

206
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,947
I just need to go to this place then?

207
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:44,547
Let's have tea there and then head to the museum.

208
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:47,007
Make sure you're on time.

209
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,227
Okay.

210
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,688
<i>[I have something to tell you. Can we meet tomorrow?]</i>

211
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,857
Medicine and a sports drink...

212
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:11,837
and something to eat...

213
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:23,564
Yumeko!

214
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:47,507
I'm so glad.

215
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,907
Why...

216
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,827
You're still a little feverish.

217
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:06,117
If it doesn't come down, let's go to the hospital.

218
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:28,557
Last time you were the one that took care of me.

219
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:42,477
While I was cooking they were here to look after you.

220
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:53,177
Yumeko, are you okay?

221
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:57,087
- Should we go the hospital-
- Don't be so nice to me.

222
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:04,277
Don't be so nice to me in this way.

223
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,257
It's just a love contract, after all.

224
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:10,797
Yumeko.

225
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:14,857
I know this sounds ridiculous.

226
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,877
I'm the one that asked you to become my ideal boyfriend

227
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,427
and you're

228
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:26,977
just acting according to the contract.

229
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,467
But...

230
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,917
it's painful.

231
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,997
Knowing that the contract will eventually end

232
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:46,477
but yet... my heart will waver if you treat me so well.

233
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:50,547
It's difficult to bear, and painful.

234
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,927
Yumeko.

235
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:56,217
I...

236
00:15:56,217 --> 00:16:00,167
Sorry. It must be because I'm still feverish.

237
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,627
I...

238
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:09,787
I wouldn't have ran to multiple pharmacies just because of the contract.

239
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,697
I wouldn't have made porridge

240
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,587
nor would I have drawn rabbits.

241
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,327
Do you really think

242
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,407
this is all just part of an act?

243
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,457
Hikaru...

244
00:16:57,007 --> 00:17:00,667
You're so silly.

245
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:05,897
That's why...

246
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:11,127
Yumeko, I...

247
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:20,717
Where are you? I've been waiting this whole time.

248
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:23,687
You didn't read my messages either. I got so worried.

249
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,037
Sorry, Aoi.

250
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,481
I won't be able to go today.

251
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,552
What's wrong? Did something happen?

252
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,702
Yumeko is sick.

253
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:37,607
So I have to stay by her side.

<i>Let's go to the museum next time.</i>

255
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:42,777
Wait, Hikaru!

256
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,087
Is everything all right?

257
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:52,897
Please sleep for a bit.

258
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:57,597
I'll be right here.
