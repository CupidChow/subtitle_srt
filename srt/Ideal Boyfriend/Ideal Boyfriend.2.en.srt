1
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:05,696
Please be my ideal boyfriend.

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:09,636
What should I do?

3
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:11,306
Please...

4
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:13,886
love me.

5
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:18,284
All right.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,340
What?

7
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:22,846
I shall make your wishes come true.

00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:42,836
<i>Oh god,</i>

10
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:44,296
<i>I'm unbelievable!</i>

11
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:47,526
<i>I brought him over in a spur, but what now?</i>

12
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:52,036
<i>Hold on, what's the right move to make here?</i>

13
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,426
- So, your wish?
- My wish?!

14
00:00:55,426 --> 00:00:57,191
Right. That.

15
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,026
I was joking.

16
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,556
Surprised? So was I.

17
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:03,696
I must've been possessed.

18
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,456
That's that. Goodbye.

19
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,856
Wait-

20
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:10,966
For starters, what should I begin with?

21
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,366
Look here, I'm not an easy woman, who's quick to let men in.

22
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:21,186
I prefer to follow the proper steps in romance-

23
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:24,256
Not saying I wish to date you.

24
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,566
Besides, I was just rejected.

25
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,446
Love is beyond me right now.

26
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:30,826
And you are younger, yes?

27
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,876
Younger guys aren't my type,

28
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:35,716
and won't ever be. In other words...

29
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:40,366
Please forget my earlier outburst.

30
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:44,156
Why did you invite me to ride the ferris wheel?

31
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:46,106
That's because...

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,116
work was stressing me out.

33
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:52,386
- Why did you ask me to love you?
- No! Don't say it!

34
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:58,006
Did you say so, because you were suffering a broken heart?

35
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,676
I suppose...

36
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:05,476
Please call me whenever you are hurt or suffering.

37
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,336
Call you, and then what?

38
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,406
I will love you, until my debt is paid.

39
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,576
- Really, no need-
- Don't overthink it.

40
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:17,716
Use me as you will

41
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:19,856
to ease yourself.

42
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,356
<i>So? What happened next?</i>

43
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:27,016
- No, did he spend the night?
- Of course not!

44
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,782
I only just met him.

45
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,766
Boring.

46
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:34,756
But bringing a young guy into your home?

47
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,656
Good going, for a Yumeko.
<i>(T/N: Yumeko translate to Dream Child)</i>

48
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,086
Hey, don't treat me like a species.

49
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,606
Gosh, I did something so stupid...

50
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,546
Sorry.

51
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,796
It's my fault for badgering you about marriage.

52
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,966
If ever I see Sawamura or his girl, they aren't getting off lightly.

53
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,766
Tomomi...

54
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:01,136
Thank you.

55
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:05,426
I really don't want to go to work.

56
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,346
Rumor spread about the harassing,

57
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:09,796
so everyone's acting on edge.

58
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:13,576
To hear a workaholic like you, complain about work...

59
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:16,956
Maybe having some fun with that boy

60
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:20,486
will be good for your broken heart.

61
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:24,156
I mean, he looks like Jinguji, right?

62
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,506
Scarily so.

63
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:31,526
Then it's worth it.

64
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,106
Worth it? This isn't stocks.

65
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,676
Same difference.

66
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,476
Now eat up.

67
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:41,016
Remember, women in their thirties need stamina and energy.

68
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:52,166
Right, it's a Sunday.

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,696
<i>Your ideal boyfriend, doesn't exist anywhere!</i>

70
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:16,866
<i>If you continue this way, nobody will like you.</i>

71
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:41,736
Sorry. You did no wrong.

72
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:46,446
<i>A broken heart won't fill an empty stomach.</i>

73
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:58,936
<i>Why did we have to meet, when I look like this?</i>

74
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:04,671
Now then, what next?

75
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,976
You're clearly not hungry anymore.

76
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:10,286
Listen, don't worry about me.

77
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:13,726
I'm sure you have your own plans, given it's a Sunday.

78
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:16,466
Exactly. So let's spend it by going somewhere.

79
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:19,019
In these clothes?

80
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,426
At least let me go home and put on makeup.

81
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:24,666
No need, you're cute as is.

82
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,996
Cute?

83
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:27,666
Come on, let's go.

84
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,886
Hey! Where to...?

85
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:33,986
♫ <i>Hope never exhausts itself</i> ♫

86
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:37,074
♫ <i>So let's believe in it</i> ♫

87
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,166
♫ <i>Yes, Like that</i> ♫

88
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:45,030
♫ <i>See? Gratitude builds into a crescendo</i> ♫

89
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:50,266
This nice weather feels so great.

90
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,130
♫ <i>I thank you for giving me the willpower I need</i> ♫

91
00:05:55,926 --> 00:06:00,236
Next time, let's bring a boxed lunch like them.

92
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:04,416
<i>I'm monopolizing an of-age guy, for a mere 50,000 yen.</i>

93
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,316
<i>Can such an unethical practice slide?</i>

94
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:11,476
<i>No, he just feels bad about borrowing money without interest.</i>

95
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:16,636
<i>Besides, he's also grateful I helped him see his Grandmother in her final moments.</i>

96
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:20,246
<i>You know who's unethical? Those two.</i>

97
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,946
<i>Cheating? Taking my boyfriend?</i>

98
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,686
<i>Fabricating harassment allegations?</i>

99
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,116
<i>They're less than humane.</i>

100
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,216
<i>Wait, hold on.</i>

101
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:29,836
<i>He said I'm the mistress.</i>

102
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:34,046
<i>Does that mean I'm the one who's less than humane?!</i>

103
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:35,746
Excuse me.

104
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,426
Are you all right?

105
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:40,156
<i>He looks just like him.</i>

106
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:44,116
<i>Who said to treat a broken heart with new love?</i>

107
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,786
<i>Do people really switch hearts that fast?</i>

108
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:50,556
<i>Are people so eager to pair themselves up?</i>

109
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:52,356
<i>Since Earth's population is about 8 billion,</i>

110
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:55,566
<i>there's a one-in-8-billion chance of finding "the one."</i>

111
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,726
<i>If miracles like that happen everywhere,</i>

112
00:06:57,726 --> 00:07:00,196
<i>then I'm going to die in its abundance.</i>

113
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:03,496
<i>- What even is an abundance of miracles?!</i>
- Excuse me!

114
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:06,736
See this?

115
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:09,106
I want to help get rid of it.

116
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,476
That won't be easy.

117
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,756
Spend time with me, and I guarantee it'll disappear.

118
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:18,926
In other words...

119
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,596
Look! Ducks!

120
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,686
See? Ducks! Come on!

121
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:28,056
Who gets excited over ducks?

122
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,846
Ducks!

123
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:32,976
Wow, there's a whole flock!

124
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:34,236
I spy turtles and koi too.

125
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:37,006
Look, there's a parent and baby turtle over there.

126
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,036
Are they sunbathing?

127
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,266
So adorable!

128
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,136
Could I see your hand?

129
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,196
Huh?

130
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,796
Hurry.

131
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:47,496
What now?

132
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,556
A sugar boost. I found them at a kiosk.
<i>(T/N: it's a box of caramels)</i>

133
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,806
No way, how nostalgic!

134
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,206
- Right?
- Thanks.

135
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:03,346
It's so sweet!

136
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:07,116
It really tastes like nostalgia. Here, try one.

137
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:21,416
<i>Maybe having some fun with that boy</i>

138
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,866
<i>will be good for your broken heart.</i>

139
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:28,306
<i>I mean, he looks like Jinguji, right?</i>

140
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,516
<i>This person isn't my Prince.</i>

141
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,306
<i>He's not Jinguji either.</i>

142
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:37,126
<i>But his smile made me...</i>

143
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,316
Come over to my place.

144
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,190
<i>[Contract of Employment]</i>

145
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,793
An employment contract?

146
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,953
We need to define our relationship, so there are no mishaps.

147
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:48,953
Mishaps?

148
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:52,093
In short, our relationship is one of business.

149
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:55,163
At the core, we're a loaner and debtor.

150
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:58,623
Instead of added interest, we shall maintain a temporary romantic relationship,

151
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,853
until the debt is paid off.

152
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,513
I only see complex jargon...

153
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:06,733
"Contractee, Yumeko Onodera (Party A),

154
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:09,363
proposes to Contractor, Youth (Party B),

155
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,893
the following contract and its directives."

156
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:14,653
"1: Party A and B will maintain a fake relationship."

157
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:17,393
"2: Party A and B shall act like lovers."

158
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:21,233
"3: Dates will occur when Party A is off work and on weekends."

159
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:22,503
"Exceptions apply."

160
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:25,683
"4: Party B will not contact A during work hours."

161
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:27,473
"If necessary, send an email."

162
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:29,863
"5: No surprises. I hate them."

163
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:33,693
"6: Do not date members of the other sex while this contract is valid. It's courtesy."

164
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:37,063
"7: Physical intimacy is limited to accidental-"

165
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,803
Is limited to?

166
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,023
I'll rethink that one.

167
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:48,413
I feel like I'm only causing you more trouble...

168
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,483
There's no helping the tedium.

169
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:54,225
Being indebted without interest is weighing on you anyways, no?

170
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:56,523
Yes, sorry.

171
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,473
Now, the most important part of this contract.

172
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:04,170
I won't ask your name,

173
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,363
your age, your backstory, nothing.

174
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:09,093
In exchange...

175
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,003
Please, let me call you Jinguji!

176
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,593
- No, right?
- Sure.

177
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,603
Seriously?!

178
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:19,203
Isn't that where you'd ask why, or who "Jinguji" even is?

179
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,843
You've mentioned this "Jinguji" several times already.

180
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:24,693
I can make a guess.

181
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:27,913
He's your first crush, right?

182
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:29,696
<i>He's sharp.</i>

183
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:33,106
In that case, please sign this contract.

184
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:39,413
Should I sign with "Jinguji"?

185
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:42,103
Probably not.

186
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,813
Then take this.

187
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:53,173
<i>Oh my god, it's so cute!</i>

188
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:57,513
Long story short, all you need is my body and face, yes?

189
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,963
Mostly your face.

190
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:04,330
I'll do my best to live up to your ideal "Jinguji",

191
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,063
Ms. Yumeko.

192
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:07,463
Yume...

193
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,560
Likewise. I look forwards to our cooperation.

194
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,540
<i>[When the 50,000 yen is repaid, this contract shall be annulled.]</i>

195
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:18,853
Good morning.

196
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,713
Good morning.

197
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:25,573
<i>Power harassment? Me?</i>

198
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,933
<i>I can't work together with her anymore.</i>

199
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:31,003
<i>It's beyond me.</i>

200
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,783
Onodera.

201
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,533
Got a minute?

202
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,543
Here you go.

203
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,731
So, regarding that harassment case.

204
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:45,573
Yes, Sir.

205
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:48,033
The opposing party withdrew their complaints.

206
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,333
What?

207
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,143
She's retiring due to marriage.

208
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,616
Everyone's heard the situation, and while it may be a given,

209
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,093
no one could find anything that could be called "harassment".

210
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,293
I see.

211
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,543
You must be hurt.

212
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:09,088
No, I knew it'd be proven that I did no such harassing.

213
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:11,823
Not about that.

214
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,433
Want a short break?

215
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:18,733
Or to continue work?

216
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:22,503
I shall keep working. It'll be a nice distraction.

217
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:25,273
Thought you'd say that.

218
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,513
These aren't just snacks then.

219
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:30,123
I expect a 10-page food review, stat.

220
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:31,623
What?!

221
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,903
I'm joking.

222
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,683
They're good.

223
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:03,423
Don't be so on edge.

224
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,113
I only came for my belongings.

225
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:07,023
I am not "on-edge".

226
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:11,513
Treat me as the villain.

227
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:14,903
It'll make work all the easier, right?

228
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,823
No need to tell me, I already am.

229
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,503
You know, I prefer pants and sneakers.

230
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:25,023
I hate cooking too.

231
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:27,953
But now I wear these clothes,

232
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:32,033
and attend cooking classes after work.

233
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:37,033
Why? It's all to marry him.

234
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:43,063
I've changed myself for the person I like.

235
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:45,073
Isn't that proof of true love?

236
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:51,213
I won't be sending you an invitation to the wedding.

237
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:54,343
Take care.

238
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:00,403
<i>I couldn't say a word.</i>

239
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:05,584
<i>Had I ever tried to change for Ichita?</i>

240
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:09,226
<i>I was always asking, never yielding...</i>

241
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:16,856
<i>Did you know gorilla's drum their chest with their palms, not their fists?</i>

242
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,625
Gorillas?

243
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:23,042
<i>You can't stick your elbows and chin together either.</i>

244
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:31,653
What are you, the Trivia Professor?

245
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:35,483
<i>Seems like I can't convey the windy smell from Sunday.</i>

246
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:37,713
<i>Let's go see the ducks again.</i>

247
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:40,573
<i>This time, with boxed lunches.</i>

248
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:44,203
Is this guy Superman?

249
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:48,103
<i>He always helps out in my time of need.</i>

250
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:57,173
Our next project is... to monopolize the sales of these madeleines.

251
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:58,603
They're quite simple.

252
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:00,583
And not photogenic at all.

253
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,873
Exactly. They're boring treats, doomed to die on social media.

254
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:06,933
Onodera, how'd it taste?

255
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,943
Simple baked goods like these rely on the quality of ingredients,

256
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:13,923
and the skills of the pâtissier.

257
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:16,923
These madeleines are rich, and fully accentuate

258
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:20,153
the flavors of its butter, flour, and sugar.

259
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,863
They also have a nice texture, making them a satisfying snack.

260
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:25,803
Don't keep us hanging, let's try them!

261
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:27,373
Flavor is, of course, key.

262
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:31,243
However, everyone's first impression

263
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:34,623
was that these are boring. That's just as crucial.

264
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:38,643
What's the biggest con of selling food online?

265
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:41,303
We can't convey its flavor.

266
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:46,093
Bingo. So how do we sell this delicious cookie?

267
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:51,303
How do we get people to buy a no-name madeleine that isn't photogenic?

268
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:53,463
I want us all to think about that.

269
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,323
May I ask about our contractor?

270
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,223
Ever since the inception of their store,

271
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:02,983
this pâtissier has prioritized face-to-face sales.

272
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:06,553
I predict they'll be against online sales.

273
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:07,863
This sounds rough.

274
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:11,653
But that's exactly why there's promise in monopolizing the sales.

275
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:16,703
I'll appoint Onodera as the leader of this endeavor.

276
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:19,983
They'll be a tough opponent. Are you up for it?

277
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,383
Yes, Sir.

278
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:24,623
We're down a person and have additional projects too.

279
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:25,843
Things are going to get busy.

280
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:27,343
Hey!

281
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:32,933
I mean, we'll be getting busy so... ask us for any help.

282
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:35,053
Thank you, I will.

283
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:37,553
Let's do our best, Ms. Yumeko.

284
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,583
But first, a taste test!

285
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,863
Bon appétit.

286
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:44,063
- For you, President.
- Thanks.

Yes, I'm starving...

293
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:10,133
Wait, what happened? You're sopping wet.

294
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,173
I started working as a deliveryman,

295
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:15,793
and they pay extra on rainy days.

296
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:26,573
One second.

297
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:31,403
Sit wherever.

298
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,163
Right, you need a towel first.

299
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,903
Ms. Yumeko, you like manga?

300
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,153
Manga?

301
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,963
I guess that would be my only hobby, yes.

302
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:49,133
Do you not read electronically on your phone or tablet?

303
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,873
I prefer reading manga on paper.

304
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,803
I see.
