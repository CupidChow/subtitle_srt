1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,260
Onodera, good morning.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,780
Good morning.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,820
I've made a reservation at 7pm.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,570
Noted with thanks.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,700
President, are you holding Yumeko's hand?

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,490
Of course not!

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,580
Why would the President hold Yumeko's hand?

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,800
Are your contact lenses misaligned?

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,940
Maybe.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,898
It's been two months since the end of contractual love with Hikaru.

11
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:35,170
And I've started to date Mizukami.

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,620
Shall we go camping next time?

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,930
Camping?

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,850
I've not been to any before.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,212
I see, because you are an indoor person.

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,280
What do you usually do at home?

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,190
Nothing much, other than reading manga.

18
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,510
I don't read manga at all.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,190
Senior, you are losing out a lot in life.

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,230
History, GO rules, alcohol names and love,

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,120
you can learn all important things in life from the manga.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,700
Is something wrong?

23
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:13,660
That's why the manga artist gets along well with you.

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,660
I didn't mean to say that.

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,760
Are you still interested in him?

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,100
No.

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,130
We will not meet again.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,110
Senior.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,410
I think you better not do that in the office again.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,830
Do you mean what happened this morning?

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,210
I'm okay to let the others know that we are dating.

32
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,530
However...

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,050
I understand.

34
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,020
For now, let's keep it a secret.

35
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,130
This is for you.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,270
It's so pretty!

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,540
If we were to get married,

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,280
it will be mandatory to let the others know.

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,780
Eh?

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,842
Senior?

41
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:25,352
Let's get married.

00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,818

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,490
- He proposed to you?!
- Yes.

48
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,750
And then I received the ring.

49
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,000
He sure acts fast!
<i>[Last episode]</i>

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,510
He's a businessman, indeed, to make fast decisions.

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,720
So, what are you doing?

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,210
Building up my stamina.

53
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,500
What?

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,210
We are going camping and trekking.

55
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,030
Trekking?!

56
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,520
For someone like you who finds going to the convenience store a chore during holidays?

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,330
Why? Am I doing something wrong?

58
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,980
If you give in to such demands, you might find it tough in the future.

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,340
I'm totally fine with it.

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,380
Senior is the Prince Charming who will help me put on the glass slippers.

61
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,660
Aren't you doing the impossible?!

62
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,780
Why the loud voice?

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,150
Toma will remain alone in the house.

64
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,230
Damn. What kind of Prince Charming is he?

65
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,160
Neglecting your likes and wants.

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,490
He's just like a tyrant!

67
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,220
It's just that we have different hobbies.

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,890
In comparison, that guy is better.

69
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,350
If it were him, he would be more concerned about you.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,350
You said that Hikaru smiles when he thinks of you.

71
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,110
I think that's not acting for sure.

72
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,940
But what's past is past.

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,790
Coming!

75
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,450
Wait a moment.

76
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,800
Did Hikaru contact you?

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,030
She's the real thing.

78
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,070
Did something happen to him?

79
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,630
Hikaru is missing.

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,730
Huh?!

81
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,540
What do you mean by "missing"?

82
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,020
He doesn't answer my calls, nor read my messages.

83
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,370
And he has not gone home all this while.

84
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,940
And also...

85
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,520
his manga series has stopped. It's the first time that such a thing has happened.

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,370
Hikaru... maybe he's thinking of disappearing forever.

87
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,960
Please. Help me look for him.

88
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,930
Even if you ask me to,

89
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,660
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

90
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,530
Nothing to do with him?

91
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,360
You also know that.

92
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,930
He was just pretending to be my first love because they look alike.

93
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,398
And the contract has ended.

94
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,430
You are wrong. It's not what you think.

95
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,270
What am I wrong about?

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,250
Hikaru liked you.

97
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,220
He was really into you!

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm not stupid.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,250
I knew how he felt.

100
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:21,272
That's why I tried to break you up.

101
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,230
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,040
I cannot find Hikaru.

103
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,550
Therefore, I beg you. Please look for him.

104
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:56,393
A pâtissier taught me to make this.

105
00:05:56,393 --> 00:06:00,493
It might not look good, but I would like you to try it.

106
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,243
You made it? Thank you.

107
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:13,543
Senior, you are... a passionate, strong-willed, and kind person.

108
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:20,023
You've always taken good care of me, as well as giving me encouragement.

109
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:26,383
After we got attached, I started to realize.

110
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:31,363
I want to stay by your side to support your dreams,

111
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:34,723
and work together.

I'm sorry.

He has... gone missing, right?

118
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:17,693
So, are you going to wait for him?

119
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,803
No, I won't.

120
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,179
I'm going to find him.

121

I will find him, definitely.

123
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:43,403
What?

124
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:49,793

Are you the editor-in-charge for Hikaru Murase?

129
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:27,963
If he contacts you, can you give me a call?

131
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,912
I beg you.

Somewhere someplace, there is a lonely lizard.

The lizard is going on a trip to look for friends.

176
00:11:57,803 --> 00:12:01,443
Inside his bag, he has his muffler made of grass and flowers...

177
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:04,383
and also juice made from flower pollen.

178
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:09,513
He heard some hissing and rustling.

179
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,903

00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:30,013
When I met you again at the airport, I knew that

183
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:35,113
it was not just pure coincidence,

184
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:37,053
but it's fate.

185
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:46,366
When you asked me to act as your ideal boyfriend,

186
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,696
I was very happy in the beginning.

187
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:55,483
In replacement of your first love or whoever he is, I was glad to be by your side.

188
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:58,503
However...

189
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,854
it started to get painful gradually...

190
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:06,553
I might forget it if I were to leave.

191
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:10,223
I might forget it if time passes by.

192
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,293
I thought that would be the case.

193
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:16,673
But...

194
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,673
I was unable to forget what happened.

195
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:27,393
I might be different from your ideal boyfriend,

196
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:30,003
but...

197
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:34,233
can I just stay by your side?

198
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:49,633
You are... not the ideal boyfriend.

199
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:53,283
Because the person who was my first love

200
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:56,513
only smiled at me once.

201
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,823
Riding on the Ferris wheel, giving me an amulet,

202
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:12,493
giving me a piggy back. He did not do anything at all.

203
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:17,303
Wanting to meet me on his birthday,

204
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:20,733
or drawing cute rabbits for me,

205
00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:23,853
he won't do any of those, definitely.

206
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:29,503
Jinguji would not do any of those.

207
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,553
Therefore...

208
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:40,533
I should not fall in love with you.

209
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:46,363
But...

210
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:56,503
I don't want you to leave me again.

211
00:15:02,573 --> 00:15:04,463
I like you.

212
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:10,163
You are the best option for me.

I love you.

Me, too.

218
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,153
I love you.

How is your stock after coming back?
<i>[Confirmation of new series.]</i>

221
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:06,283
I told you that Hikaru is not just any stock.

222
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:11,813
In the end, the person you like becomes the ideal person. This often happens.

223
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:15,013
Sorry that it has ended this way.

224
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:19,773
But when I was looking for him,

225
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:24,580
I was thinking if I were to find him, I will make him happy.

226
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:30,213
The princess will make Prince Charming happy.

227
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:33,193
Fairy tales can also have such endings, right?

228
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:36,093
You are already over 30, and you are still thinking about becoming a princess?

229
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:37,173
Good grief!

230
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:40,423
- So, I am the dreamy Yumeko!
- So, you are the dreamy Yumeko!

231
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:46,603
Look at the photo.

232
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:48,913
Both of them are all over each other.

233
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:51,233
They must be having their honeymoon now!

234
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,913
- What are you looking at?
- Quick, hide it!

235
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,723
As expected, the limelight is always on the bride.

236
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:59,643
She looks pretty!

237
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,913
Why do you look so shocked?

238
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:10,233
She has already moved on.

239
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:14,923
Onodera. What was the title of the manga that you recommended?

240
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:16,753
It's "White Blue Pink".

241
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,313
That's the one!

242
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:20,913
In case you forget, let me send you a message.

243
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:22,133
Thank you.

244
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,043
Today is Aoi Miki's birthday!

245
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,110
Let us welcome her!

246
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,520
<i>Thank you to our Other Languages Moderators!</i>

247
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:35,263
I, Aoi Miki,

248
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:39,773
declare that I will be an idol forever!

249
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:43,013
Everyone, be prepared to follow me for life!

250
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,833
He's a fan.

251
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,271
I'm the Number One fan of Aoi.

252
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,523
All right.

253
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,193
Are you really leaving?

254
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:01,283
Europe is the place for aromatics.

255
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:04,233
I've always thought of studying someday.

256
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,803
I won't send you off.

257
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:16,973
Even when I'm not around, sleep well and eat well. Remember to lead a happy life.

258
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:22,713
If you make Yumeko cry again,

259
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:25,763
I will fly to wherever you are in this world.

260
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:27,533
Roger.

261
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,963
See you.

263
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:44,003
When you were traveling, you drew these sceneries.

264
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:46,723
Yes, I learned a lot during that time.

265
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:50,113
But solo trips are in the past.

266
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:54,743
From now, we will go on trips together.

267
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:59,233
We can start by going on a honeymoon.

268
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,303
Eh? What?

269
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:04,963
Is that a proposal?

270
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:08,973
A proposal without flowers or a ring, would you accept it?

271
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,683
Let's just forget what I said.

272
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,253
Wait up!

273
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,333
How can I forget what you just said?

274
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:17,813
But I am not mentally prepared to get married.

275
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:21,583
If you need to be mentally ready, why don't we draft a contract?

276
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,773
I see. That's a good idea.

277
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,983
Let's have meal duties, plus a rubbish disposal schedule.

278
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,363
Even after getting married, let's go on a date once a week.

279
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:31,963
There is only one clause in the contract.

280
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:37,063
I will continue to love you every day.

281
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:38,663
