00:00:00,557 --> 00:00:03,230
Yumeko!

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:06,517
I've missed you!

3
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:09,937
Look! Didn't I become a good man as promised?

4
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:10,837
Didn't I?

5
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:13,777
Knock it off, Toma.

6
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,857
I've missed that scolding voice.

7
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:18,077
You use to get mad at me all the time.

8
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,992
Anyways, who are you?

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,027
Why are you naked?

10
00:00:23,027 --> 00:00:24,177
Well...

11
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:25,687
I promise you, there's a reason.

12
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:30,177
Don't tell me he's your boy...

13
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:31,917
I can't even say it!

14
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,477
Yes, I'm Ms. Yumeko's boyfriend.

15
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:35,687
- Huh?
- What?

16
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:39,047
I'm her boyfriend.

17
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:48,527
In short, Toma's your cousin's cousin,

18
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:52,167
who used to live at your place for six months.

19
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:55,467
Exactly. We use to bath together and sleep together too!

20
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,877
- I even cleaned your bed-wetting.
- Did not.

21
00:00:57,877 --> 00:01:00,107
Jeez, your memory only works in your favor.

22
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:03,477
I handed you a letter the day I left, Yumeko.

23
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:08,077
In it, I wrote that I'd become a good man, and marry you.

24
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:11,267
So here I've come, as promised!

25
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,257
I don't remember receiving a letter.

26
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:14,787
What?!

27
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:19,147
This is where you take the letter out of a cookie can,

28
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,118
and tell me you were waiting.

29
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,750
Out of a cookie can? Really?

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,507
Let's find happiness together, Yumeko. I promised.

31
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:29,967
- You're such a child.
- Ouch!

32
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:33,327
A child? With these looks? No way.

33
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:37,237
You two get along, like siblings.

34
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:41,167
- That wasn't exactly a subtle jab.
- A jab? I'd never.

35
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:47,156
Is this dude seriously your boyfriend? You two are way too stiff.

36
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:50,288
Like I said, we have our reasons.

37
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,768
Reasons this, reasons that.

38
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:54,797
No, something's off.

39
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:57,947
<i>He's always had a sharp instinct, if nothing else.</i>

40
00:01:58,657 --> 00:02:02,397
Toma, what do you do nowadays?

41
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,467
- I'm a perfumer.
- Perfume...?

42
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:10,307
It's a job where you concoct perfumes from scratch, right? That's amazing.

43
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:14,937
I currently study the basics, while working part-time at my acquaintance's aroma store.

44
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:17,318
Toma, you've grown...

45
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:20,847
I'm on my way to becoming a good man.

46
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,907
Isn't that great, Yumeko-

47
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,757
Are you okay?

48
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,457
That was definitely on purpose.

49
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:29,077
Maybe you have a cold.

50
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:31,167
No, I'm fine.

51
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,027
I'm worried. Stay over today.

52
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:35,777
- What?!
- I can't impose...

53
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:39,417
- Colds always get worse throughout the night.
-  Still...

54
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:43,037
Yumeko, if he's staying, so am I.

55
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,537
What?

56
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,637
- I think I feel feverish.
- See?

57
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,227
Your timing is way too impeccable!

58
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:52,597
Hold on, do I have any medicine?

59
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:54,807

00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:51,047
That sounds <i>so</i> dreamy! Are you Ms. Popular now?

73
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:54,267
No, more like a preschool teacher.

74
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,407
True.

75
00:03:56,407 --> 00:04:00,077
Men will always be kids, no matter the age.

76
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:02,617
Sloppy, picky, my husband's a sorry case.

77
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,807
He's like a son I've never asked for.

78
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,157
So what should I do?

79
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:15,867
Not all frogs will turn into Princes.

80
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:16,827
Frogs?

81
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,687
Words from a famous investor.

82
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:22,127
No one knows what stock will profit.

83
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:27,117
Ergo, all stocks have the potential to be profitable.

84
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,717
In other words...

85
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,657
Invest in them both.

86
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:34,407
Romance is an investment of money, time, and effort.

87
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:39,047
Invest in them, and see if one of them becomes a Prince.

88
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:42,007
No, turn them into a Prince!

89
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,327
What does that mean?

90
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,737
Date them both, simultaneously.

91
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:48,677
After all, you never know who will become a Prince.

92
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:52,517
Diversified investment always lowers your risks.

93
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:54,987
I could never!

94
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:57,357
This is why introverts are hopeless.

95
00:04:57,357 --> 00:05:00,587
Guy A is someone who'll become your ideal.

96
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:03,257
Guy B is someone who's always loved you.

97
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:04,657
Can you choose one now?

98
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:07,947
Hold on. Jinguji is my contract boyfriend.

99
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:10,087
He's only acting the part.

100
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,137
And who knows if Toma's serious-

101
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:13,977
Neither are you.

102
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:18,917
You're playing-lovers to ease your lonely heart.

103
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,517
I mean, yes...

104
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:25,887
But what if neither are Princes?

105
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,557
Isn't that obvious?

106
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,997
Cut your losses.

107
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,557
You're on your way, Onodera?

108
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,817
Yes, Sir. I'll make us a great deal.

109
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:40,917
Like I said, this won't be easy.

110
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,917
But "no progress..."

111
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,837

00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:47,338

However, I've always served my customers face-to-face.

As you say,

141
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:02,349

159

00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:48,181
Here's a smoothie for clear skin.

181

It's good.

182
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,581
Right?

183
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,351
So your luggage

184
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,481
was filled with things for me.

185
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,761
Touched?

186
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:09,671
A bit.

187
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:12,973
I promise this isn't the end of it.

188

189
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:22,261
Yes, I've received your email. I shall send the details on Monday.

She's like an advisor for my part-time job.

197

Was it a serious matter?

198

Things haven't been going so well.

199
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:02,356

It's fine. I haven't had a fruitful shopping trip like this in a while.

234
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:02,526
I know. Would you like to go out for drinks?

No need to worry.

I welcome all overtime! Call me on weekends!

261
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,899
What sort of person is he?

262
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,799
We use to work in an advertising agency together.

263
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,089
He's the one who offered me my current job.

264
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,149
He use to be terrifying, you know?

265
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:02,429
I thought he was the devil himself.

266
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,029
Wow...

267
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,719
But he's got his reasons for being strict.

268
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:13,119
All my gusto for work, comes from him.

269
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,349
He's got a burning heart. I respect him.

270
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,059
I see.

271
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:24,209
This next project was one he entrusted to me.

272
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:28,109
That's why I absolutely want to succeed.

273
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:31,029
Can't shame my CEO.

274
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,129
- Is he only a coworker?
- What?

275
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,939
Your CEO.

276
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:38,299
What do you...

277
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:42,039
Well, respect sometimes turns to something else.

278
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,829
Something else?

279
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,799
You know...

280
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,959
Never mind.

281
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,969
Don't you have any dreams? Goals? Future job?

282
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:06,469
I wanted to make a living and get rich off of my passions.

283
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:09,279
It's the very reason I came to Tokyo.

284
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,609
I guess things don't always go so well.

285
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:20,329
What is this "passion" of yours?

286
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,429
Well...

287
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,749
Stop!

288
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:28,569
Sorry, I promised I wouldn't ask.

289
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,989
Personal matters are off-limits.

290
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:36,399
Right. After all, I'm "Jinguji".

291
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:38,839
<i>Exactly, this is "Jinguji".</i>

292
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,399
<i>He's acting as my ideal boyfriend, "Jinguji".</i>

293
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,097
We're both a bit drunk. Let's grab some fresh air.

294
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,529
That's a dangerous stunt in high heels.

295
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,679
No need to worry. I may look clumsy,

296
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,937
but I'm actually pretty athletic.

297
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,879
I even ran a relay.

298
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,259
I would've loved to meet the young you.

299
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,009
You're better off not.

300

Why?

301
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:08,499
Because I was a total loser.

302
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,409
Loser or not, I wish we'd met.

303
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:14,000
You must've been so cute.

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,490
