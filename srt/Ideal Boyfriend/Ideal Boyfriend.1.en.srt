- Actually, we saw your boyfriend buying a ring yesterday.
- What?

00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:23,196
Even from afar, I could see that the stone on the ring is big.

00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:25,166
That must be your engagement ring.

21

Both of you entered the advertising agency at the same time, right?

22
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:31,086

23
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:35,486
I think her boyfriend would want to keep it a secret.

26
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:41,676

- I'll do that.
- Good.

Ichita is a perfect man to marry.

29
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:52,066
But I wish that he can take the initiative during our dates.

30
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,386
He always asks, "Where do you want to go?" or "What do you want to eat?"

31
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,686
So, I have to decide in the end.

32
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,006
<i>I also hope he can contact me more frequently.</i>

33
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:01,916
<i>The other time, when I had realized, it was already three days.</i>

34
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,886
<i>Three days without any calls or messages.</i>

35
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:06,916
And I hope he would say something like "Come to me. I will protect you."

36
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,596
Such words sound so manly.

37
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,626
And I do not intend to stop working after getting married.

38
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:16,146
Ichita always says, "If you work harder, you can advance further in your career." Therefore...

- W-Wait a minute.

00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,016
you were a hard worker who was not popular or in the limelight.

<i>But your love debuted in university and had a few relationships.</i>

46
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,166
<i>However, things did not go well.</i>

47
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,856
And it's the same for your current boyfriend.

48
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:42,386
So, what is your ideal boyfriend?

49
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,216
Do you just want to say such a man doesn't exist?

50
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:45,176
<i>No.</i>

51
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:48,776
I think Nozomu Jinguji is the one.

52
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,936
Why mention him suddenly?

53
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:54,736

62

<i>Gaming.</i>

<i>I want to play games with you, too!</i>

<i>But your first love is a delusion and fantasy.</i>

66
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:33,096
Do you know?

67
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:37,866
Jinguji got married in Brazil to a Latin woman, and they already have three children.

68
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,866
<i>And he's so fat now. Everything is in the past now.</i>

Stop. Don't say anymore.

70
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:47,006
Anyway, getting an ideal boyfriend is not realistic.

71

82
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:18,986
<i>Without prying, she predicted that this investment would be fruitful.</i>

<i>And it came true when she got married.</i>

00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:43,303
<i>I can't work together with her anymore.</i>

176
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:46,343
<i>It's beyond me.</i>

177
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,963
Are you all right?

178
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:57,123
Huh? Why?

179
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:00,113
Jinguji?

180
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,580
Are you all right?

181
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,760
Thank you so much.

182
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,380
Can I know...

183
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,510
why are you...

184
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,620
I was waiting for you in front of your company.

185
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,880
It's the paper bag that you were carrying. That's how I knew about your company.

186
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,720
Paper bag?

187
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,130
I remember the paper bag in your hands at the airport.

188
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,150
Don't tell me you've been waiting all this time?

189
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,031
About five hours.

190
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,551
That long?!

191
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,300
I gave you that money.

192
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,210
Therefore, you don't need to come on purpose to return it.

193
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,590
For that...

194
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,720
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,220
What?

196
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,250
I don't think I can return the money immediately.

197
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,100
During that time, I gathered all the money that I had,

198
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,930
and put them into the wallet for the flight.

199
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,790
But I lost the wallet.

200
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,930
In other words, I don't think I can pay back the money.

201
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,220
I'm really sorry.

202
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,170
Don't worry.

203
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,410
I didn't expect you to return the money at all.

204
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,320
So, don't worry about it.

205
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:46,089
Although... I cannot return the money immediately,

206
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,660
can I do anything for you in return?

207
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,530
Please tell me what you want me to do.

208
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,020
Wait, you don't have to do this.

209
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:05,700
It's all thanks to you that I was able to see my grandmother before she passed away.

210
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,581
I don't have any parents.

211
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,051
My grandmother raised me.

212
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,120
If I did not see her for the last time,

213
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,060
I would've probably regretted it for the rest of my life.

214
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,530
Therefore...

215
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,010
I am indebted to you.

216
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,420
Please let me do something for you. I beg you.

217
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,570
I can feel what you are trying to convey.

218
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,170
So, please forget about the money.

219
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,060
- But I won't feel-
- It's really okay.

220
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,500
<i>They really look alike.</i>

221
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,137
By the way,

222
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:55,157
you are not related in any way to a person named Nozomu Jinguji, right?

223
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,670
Sorry, please forget what I said.

224
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,680
<i>During high school, my classmates would go on dates at the amusement park.</i>

225
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,380
<i>But I just had my head in books.</i>

226
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,400
<i>To have a date at the amusement park was something unimaginable.</i>

227
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,200
<i>It would only happen in my dreams.</i>

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,300
If you want to do something for me,

229
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,500
can I have a request?

230
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,910
Yes, of course.

231
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,770
That! Can you go on a ride with me together?

232
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,170
What?

233
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,630
<i>If I was was with Jinguji, would I be feeling this way?</i>

234
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,150
<i>Come over here.</i>

235
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,960
<i>Just come here.</i>

236
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,640
<i>Don't let go of my hand until I say so.</i>

237
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,110
<i>I won't let go.</i>

238
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,870
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

239
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,850
Excuse me.

240
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,920
Are you all right?

241
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,700
<i>Oh no! The fantasy was too overwhelming.</i>

242
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,938
<i>I am going to get marry soon.</i>

243
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,658
<i>What exactly am I doing?</i>

244
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,820
I came to return the money to you,

245
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,700
but I'm sorry that you still paid for the tickets.

246
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,780
Never mind about that. Thank you for riding with me.

247
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,620
If I were to be alone today, I might be feeling upset.

248
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,870
Then I shall take my leave.

249
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,750
I will definitely return you the money someday.

250
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,110
Okay. See you then.

251
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,280
Excuse me.

252
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,390
What is your name?

253
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,460
Never mind.

254

258
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,466
Ichita.

259
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,356
Wait for me.

260
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,626
What is this about?

261
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:25,766
Go back first.

262
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:28,466
"Go back"? What do you mean by that?

263
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:29,866
This is...

264
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:32,636
Shall we have a talk?

265
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:35,696
My dear senior Yumeko.

266
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:41,486
We were going to have dinner,

267
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:44,506
he said he wanted to drink beer.

268
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,446
Would you like to have some, too?

269
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:52,116
This doesn't look like the first time.

270
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,336
What are you planning to do?

271
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:57,236
Coming to the house of a man who has a girlfriend.

272
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,116
I think...

273
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:02,676
it's you who's intruding.

274
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,576
When did it start?

275
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:11,616
I say you are really slow to realize.

276
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:15,756
Isn't it weird to entertain guests in an Italian restaurant on Christmas Eve?

277
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:17,506
I thought that

278
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:20,566
it is possible for work.

279
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:23,876
You might look good now,

280
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:26,998
but if you are a student, you will definitely be unpopular.

281
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:29,736
Even if it's so,

282
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,156
you are already my boyfriend,

283
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,960
but you're the worst to have a fling with another woman!

284
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,430
Shut up! You are the third party!

285
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:40,056
Compared to me, you are more educated.

286
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:43,846
And you also earn more money and treat me like your subordinate.

287
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:47,186
I cannot become your ideal boyfriend!

288
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,656
And regarding your ideal boyfriend,

289
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:52,756
he doesn't exist anywhere!

290
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:59,776
The harassment consulting service really works.

291
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,986
Do you really think it's power harassment?

292
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:09,376
I respect you for your working ability.

293
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:13,006
But I have my doubts for you as a woman.

294
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:17,296
If you continue this way, nobody will like you.

295
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,706
Why...

296
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,936
Why are you here?

297
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,466
I felt that you were calling out to me.

298
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,026
Am I mistaken?

299
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:08,736
Are you all right?
