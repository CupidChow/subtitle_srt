<i>She's Aoi Miki, the unwavering favorite from the idol group "Be With You".</i>

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,476
What are you doing with someone's boyfriend, old lady?

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,280
Old lady?

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,330
Aoi, I'm going to send Yumeko back.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,820
You go back first.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,530
I need to talk to this old lady.

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,300
I don't think you can calm down and talk peacefully.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,140
How can I calm down in such a situation?

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,560
Just listen to me.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,793
Who is this old lady?

12
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:25,237
Aoi!

13
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,832
I just remembered!

14
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,710
I have an early schedule tomorrow.

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,436
So, I need to go back first.

16
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,655
Toma, you go too.

17
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:39,800
What? Okay.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,390
Wait up!

19
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,940
Don't go.

Is she his girlfriend?

I'm sorry for not sending you back yesterday.

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,151
It's totally fine.

48
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,121
I've not walked home for a long time, so I felt healthy.

49
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,030
Can I meet you after this?

<i>I would like to explain this to you.</i>

52
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,790
About yesterday,

53
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,150
I don't really remember.

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,510
You see, I was very drunk.

55
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,690
When I drink too much, I lose my memory.

56
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,200
Even so, I want to talk to you.

57
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,030
I have an appointment today.

58
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,780
And I'm going to work late tomorrow.

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,220
<i>Therefore...</i>

60
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,410
Okay, I understand.

61
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,330
Then I'll wait till you are available.

62
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:27,250
He made an effort to call you.

63
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,660
What a waste. You should just meet him.

64
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,303
I don't have the courage to meet him.

65
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:34,883
Do you need courage to meet him?

66
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:39,930
You were the one who decided not to ask about his name and background.

67
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,990
Hikaru.

68
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,510
That's his real name, Hikaru.

69
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,100
<i>His name suits him well.</i>

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,323
But when he's Hikaru and not Jinguji,

71
00:03:57,323 --> 00:04:00,270
I don't know how to face him.

72
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,846
But it's unexpected that he has an idol girlfriend.

73
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,020
If Aoi Miki is really his girlfriend,

74
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,010
it's better to cut ties with him earlier.

75
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,150
<i>[First photo album of Aoi Miki from "Be With You" is Number One on the sales ranking!]</i>

76

Yumeko! It is Number One!

77
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,670
Number One?

78
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,170
- What is Number One?
- It's the President!

79
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,220
He's Number One on the trending search.

80
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,040
His interview in the "Challengers" was broadcasted yesterday.

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,140
Was it?

82
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,240
He's been rejecting interviews with face appearances,

83
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,020
but just one appearance received attention immediately.

84
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,210
The related keywords are Ryu Mizukami: single, good-looking, age...

85
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,116
When did this start?

86
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,540
Being single as a President is a miracle and a good catch.

87
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,730
Does he have a girlfriend? Yumeko, do you know anything?

113
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,285
No.

114
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:29,390
I mean only the two of us.

115
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,687
Huh?

116
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:35,345
Sometimes we should go for something delicious on our own.

117
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,009
Huh?

118
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,807
What's wrong? Did someone confess his love to you?

119
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:58,407
Nothing of that sort. It's just a dinner invitation.

120
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:02,197
Damn! Another love rival?

121
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,092
Yumeko.

122
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:12,707
Have you talked to him?

123
00:07:15,787 --> 00:07:18,519
Just look at your eyebags.

124
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,573
For you.

125
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,207
- What is this?
- A scent for good sleep.

126
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,077
I concocted it especially for you.

127
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,453
A lack of sleep will increase the chance of getting wrinkles by 45% and freckles by 13%.

128
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,187
It's the biggest enemy for your skin.

129
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,787
Thank you.

130
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,907
What were you reading?

131
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:43,617
It's some online manga.

132
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:47,667
It's about a 30-year-old OL who just fell out of love,

133
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,657
and went into a love contract with a younger man.

134
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:55,297
The heroine is just like you.

135
00:07:56,337 --> 00:08:00,857
The artist is a female, so the story is realistic.

136
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,677
Do you want to read it?

137
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:05,147
I like to read manga in paper format.

138
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:08,707
In comparison, a 30-year-old unpopular OL signs a love contract

139
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:10,697
and then really falls in love after that.

140
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:12,590
That's more realistic.

141
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,070
I think you're right.

142
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,907
Oh no! I have to go.

143
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,229
Thank you for the present.

144
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,574
He still smiles like when he was a child.

145
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:32,887
Hey, the guy who dates two girls at a time!

146
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,597
I told you Aoi is not my girlfriend.

147
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,847
That, that!

148
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:37,957
Hikaru.

149
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:39,197
Aoi.

150
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:42,155
Only couples call each other by their first names!

151
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,387
There is a reason behind it.

152
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:48,267
However, I want to tell Yumeko about it first.

153
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,307
It's not that I'm not confident with my strength,

154
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:53,667
but I don't like violence.

155
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,787
Let's have a challenge. Who wins will become Yumeko's boyfriend.

156
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,639
Yumeko is not a reward.

157
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,574
Are you trying to escape?

158
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:20,927
This is just the first out of three games.

159
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,247
You changed the rules on your own.

160
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:25,537
Next will be a dance battle.

161
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:27,577
Are we really doing it?

162
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:33,487
You don't have to explain your relationship with Aoi to me.

163
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,883
However...

164
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,177
Just explain to Yumeko properly.

165
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:43,317
Of course, I know that.

166
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:50,487
Hey! Don't treat me like a kid!

167
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,691
Excuse me.

168
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,937
Aoi Miki?

169
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:00,937
I would like to talk to you.

170
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:03,970
Come here quickly!

171
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,348
Okay.

172
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:07,219
Stand there.

173
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,658
This is for you.

174
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,388
Yes?

175
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:16,348
I have a request, so this is your advance payment.

176
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:19,198
By the way, this photo is extremely rare.

177
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,398
So, what's your request?

178
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:24,618
Please be that person's boyfriend.

179
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,248
That person... do you mean Yumeko?

180
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:30,608
You like her, right? So, just be her boyfriend.

181
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:33,118
- It's not as easy as you think.
- You can do it.

182
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:35,688
Just do it when she's asleep.

183
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,698
You look cute, but your words are harsh.

184
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:41,108
Even if I do it during her sleep,

185
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,328
I won't be able to win her heart.

186
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:45,588
What an innocent fool.

187
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,728
So, what he said is true.

188
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:50,398
You are not his girlfriend.

189
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:54,008
Idols are not allowed to fall in love.

190
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:58,208
Anyway, I don't want Hikaru to be with another woman. I don't want to see that.

191
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,868
That's not the feeling of love,

192
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:03,358
but just your own possessiveness.

193
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:06,578
I didn't come here to be lectured by you!

194
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:11,158
How childish like an elementary school kid.

195
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,208
Her hands are cold.

196
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:26,868
The ideal company is one without overtime work.

197
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:28,198
Senior.

198
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:29,438
What are you doing?

199
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,998
I have nothing to do at home, so I'm writing a new proposal.

200
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:35,438
Really? Let me see.

201
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:41,658
So, it's a project to support young pâtissiers?
<i>[Support Project for Young Pâtissiers]</i>

202
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,488
To have a kitchen where they can share

203
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:46,118
high-cost machines, such as ovens and fridges,

204
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:50,738
young pâtissiers can start their own shops with a low budget.

205
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:52,278
I see.

206
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:54,668
It's a good idea.

207
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:56,788
Okay. Let's make a list of the machines.

208
00:11:56,788 --> 00:11:58,578
And also the venue list.

209
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,638
So, are you going to write the proposal together? As the President?

210
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,738
Can't I do it?

211
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:09,378
It reminds me of how we used to work throughout the night.

212
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:11,418
Yes, we did.

213
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,788
Onodera.

214
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,418
Think about what you want to eat next time.

215
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:29,358
<i>Being single as a President is a miracle and also a good catch.</i>

216
00:12:41,814 --> 00:12:46,654
<i>Even so, I want to meet you for a talk.</i>

217
00:12:56,134 --> 00:13:00,894
<i>This is for you. Hope that your work will go smoothly.</i>

218
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:07,854
Okay. Let me walk home.

219
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,805
Arrghh.

220
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:25,005
You can't be serious!

221
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,895
Hey, Pretty! What are you doing?

222
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,984
Let's go for a drink then.

223
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:34,017
- Let's go!
- Wait! Stop it!

224
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,587
Yumeko!

225
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,814
<i>Why...</i>

226
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:50,164
What a way to spoil the mood!

227
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,784
What are you doing at this time in the night?

228
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:58,224
Of course, it's work.

229
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:00,444
Why are you angry?

230
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:02,374
I'm not angry.

231
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,594
It was just a small accident.

232
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,864
- Wait a moment!
- Don't struggle and grab tight.

233
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,034
You don't have to...

234
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:20,324
Just think of me as a giant stuffed bear.

235
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,064
A stuffed bear?

236
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:25,794
If so, it will be easy for you to cling on.

237
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,875
Can you be a panda instead?

238
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,126
Of course.

239
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:08,474
Can you listen to me?

240
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:15,714
Aoi is my childhood friend.

241
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:20,674
We came to Tokyo for our dreams.

242
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:25,834
Her dream was to become an idol.

243
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,268
For me,

244
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:31,464
I also have my own dream.

245
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:37,914
Aoi's mother said it's fine for us to come to Tokyo together.

246
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:41,064
We've known each other for a long time and are just like siblings.

247
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:43,214
Her mother said she felt relieved for me to be with her.

248
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:47,384
Aoi is really a hard worker.

249
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,184
She took endless classes every day.

250
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,653
And she has realized her idol dream.

251
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:57,114
Therefore...

252
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:01,994
To me, Aoi is a childhood friend,

253
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,234
as well as a compatriot.

254
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:11,904
I have remained stagnant

255
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,194
and yet to realize my dream.

256
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:26,794
As long as you have a dream, you will realize it someday.

257
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,862
What?

258
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,874
This is a famous quote from someone.

259
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,934
I don't know what your dream is,

260
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:40,574
but if you continue bravely to pursue your dream,

261
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:44,584
you will realize it someday.

262
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:49,884
Therefore, please do not give up.

263
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:54,604
I understand.

264
00:16:58,264 --> 00:16:59,934
Stop!

265
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:10,998
So much for the piggyback.

266
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:13,934
I'm really sorry to make you do that.

267
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:17,044
Recently, I've been binge eating and putting on weight.

268
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:19,154
Why binge eating?

269
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,084
That's because...

270
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,574
Yumeko.

271
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:40,314
Did you want to meet me?

272
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:50,646
I wanted to see you... very much.

273
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:57,164
I mean it, really.

274
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:05,294
You can continue to call me Jinguji.

275
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,721
If not,

276
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:11,971
maybe you would not allow me to stay by your side.
