00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:02,613
<i>Yumeko.</i>

2
00:00:02,613 --> 00:00:05,123
<i>I wanted to see you very much.</i>

3
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:08,383
<i>Ice-cream...</i>

4
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,213
<i>Please wait at home.</i>

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,873
Yumeko...

6
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:16,783
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:19,973
Yumeko!

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,753
Why did you come here? Stand up!

9
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,443
You're drunk?

10
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,893
I felt I had to return what you gave me.

11
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:30,663
We've broken up, after all.

12
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,503
I feel bad for holding on to it.

13
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:35,483
We didn't break up. I was dumped.

14
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:37,593
I'm returning this to you.

15
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,403
You don't have to return it to me.

16
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:42,913
I've to return it. It was a present you gave to me.

17
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:48,663
The way we broke up kept weighing on my mind.

18
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:51,018
Let me go!

19
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,678
Don't touch her.

20
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:57,713
Don't touch my girlfriend.

21
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,453
Are you okay?

22
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:08,623
Who the hell are you?

23
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:10,437
You're pathetic.

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,237
Not letting her go and coming to see her.

25
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:16,813
Did you say she's your girlfriend?

26
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:18,203
This is crazy.

27
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,373
We've only broken up not long ago.

28
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:23,503
So what? My fault?

29
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:28,333
It must be tough on you too, huh?

30
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,613
I pity you.

31
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:34,503
Must be tiring to date Yumeko who only dreams of her ideal partner.

32
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:40,053
This woman's expectations of an ideal man is really high.

33
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:42,023
Stop it.

34
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,953
Ideal man?

35
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,653
I'll be one if she wishes me to.

36
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:49,323
Am I wrong?

00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:11,083
Thanks. I mean...

39
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:15,513
For pretending to be my boyfriend.

40
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,263
I honestly didn't like it.

41
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:21,763
Huh?

42
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,813
I didn't want him to touch you.

43
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:35,423
Stop hurting yourself, for that person's sake too.

44
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,133
Thanks.

45
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,783
Thanks to you, I can move on.

46
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:45,003
I did the right thing by breaking up with that man.

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,343
If you don't feel safe about him coming again,

48
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:52,483
shall I stay over?

49
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,833
So? The two of you finally...

50
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,310
He ate ice-cream and went home.

51
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,143
That pattern again?

52
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:11,133
You're not a kid, you know?

53
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:14,393
If you don't go with the flow, things won't progress.

54
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,933
That's if he's my real boyfriend.

55
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:22,243
- He probably likes you, Yumeko.
- What?

56
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,903
Has "interim" Jinguji returned the money to you?

57
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,563
Well, he hasn't.

58
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:29,103
He didn't return it so he could continue his relationship with you.

59
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,713
No way he'd do that.

60
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:33,223
He's working part-time. Why wouldn't he return you?

61
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,613
He's careless in his finances? He's irresponsible?

62
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,263
He's not irresponsible.

63
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:39,443
If anything, he's honest and pure.

64
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:42,933
I know, right? He's fallen for you.

65
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,973
There's no mistake in my judgment.

66
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:46,613
Definitely no way.

67
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:47,943
No freaking way.

68
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:53,083
But you know, meeting a man who looks exactly like your first love...

69
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,833
don't you think it's fate?

70
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:59,783
But ultimately, he's not Jinguji, but Hikaru.

71
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:00,803
Wait.

72
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,753
An earnest guy younger than you

73
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:06,703
and has always liked you is very important.

74
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:09,223
But the president's great specs are also hard to ignore.

75
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,133
Toma feels like a little brother to me,

76
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,853
and nothing's going on yet between me and the president.

77
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,313
Not yet, right?

78
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:16,613
Don't tease me like that.

79
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:23,243
Honestly, I don't want to be hurt in love relationships anymore.

80
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:26,953
That's why a love contract is good enough.

81
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:31,693
Rather than logic, why not leave it to your heart to decide?

82
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,263
"I want to date this type of guy."

83
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:37,273
Having ideals for marriage is, of course, also important.

84
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:41,643
But it's also okay to be attracted to someone totally opposite from our ideals.

85
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:44,618
Marrying someone who's the total opposite of our ideals

86
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,423
and being happy is also possible.

87
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:54,443
What's important is for you to seriously reach out to the person whom you yearn for in your heart.

88
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:03,143
<i>What in the world is an ideal boyfriend?</i>

89
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:06,606
<i>What kind of guy does my heart yearn for?</i>

90
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:11,483
<i>Did I say my ideal one is an open-minded, high-spec, and matured man?</i>

91
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,853
<i>Great job, Onodera.</i>

92
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:18,013
<i>I bought a chocolate gateau for you.</i>

93
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:21,693
<i>Or my ideal boyfriend is one who's fully devoted to me?</i>

94
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,373
<i>Laundry? I'll do it.</i>

95
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:28,361
<i>More importantly, I made pudding, so eat it, okay?</i>

96
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,999
<i>Or I still can't forget my first love, after all?</i>

97
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:36,389
<i>Yumeko, shall we share this delicious macaron together?</i>

98
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:41,583
Leave it to my heart, huh?

99

No, rather, how did you know I live here?

113
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,123
I asked Hikaru.

114
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:53,203
I told him I wanted to apologize to you for the other day.

115
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:57,217
So... you came to apologize?

116
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,703
Of course not.

117
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:01,343
Can we have a moment?

118
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,287
What do you want to drink? Tea? Orー

119
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,277
Something without caffeine.

120
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,237
Here you go.

121
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:25,747
I watched your video. You seemed to get along well with the other members.

122
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,257
Well, that's part of the business.

123
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:35,257
When I turn 25, I'll quit being an idol.

124
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,497
Why?

125
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,627
I'll marry Hikaru.

126
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:41,617
That was what I decided when I was young.

127
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:45,098
I'll build a family with Hikaru, with the man I love,

128
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,836
and show him the warmth of a family.

129
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,939
You know about Hikaru's parents, right?

130
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:57,667
About that... not really.

131
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:01,327
You don't know? I thought you were dating each other.

132
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:05,027
<i>I didn't tell her it's a love contract.</i>

133
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,767
We just started dating, that's why.

134
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:12,759
Anyway, he has been supporting me in my dream.

135
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,163
This time, I'll be the one to support his dream.

136
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,907
His dream?

137
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,497
You don't know anything about Hikaru, do you?

138
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:22,737
You're his girlfriend, for goodness' sake.

139
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,747
If he hasn't told you, then I won't tell you too.

140
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:30,977
Things may not be going well right now,

141
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,747
but I'm sure we'll succeed if there's an opportunity.

142
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,397
No, I'll make it succeed.

143
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,587
We have been together for most of our lives.

144
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,847
Don't you think there's some meaning to our time together?

145
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:50,077
Don't love him any more than what you're doing now.

00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:58,267
If you don't go over to that main road there, you can't get a taxi.

00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,747
But I really have to go.

179
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,787
Did something happen?

180
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:25,937
I'm truly sorry.

181
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:34,290
♫ <i>Sometimes you know just how far you have to go</i> ♫

182
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,330
♫ <i>How to love and be loved</i> ♫

183
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:44,230
♫ <i>Only this, I can't win this fight</i> ♫

184

186
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,190
♫ <i>When it comes down to it, I just won't feel what everyone talks about</i> ♫

187
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,497
Hikaru!

188
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:10,677
Why are you here?

189
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:13,427
I had a feeling you were calling for me.

190
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:18,157
Am I wrong?

191
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,936
It's dangerous to run around in those heels.

192
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:30,976
It's fine.

193
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:34,446
I told you I was a former relay athlete.

194
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,316
Are you okay?

195
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,956
I'm fine. I have a plaster with me.

196
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,456
- Pass it to me.
- What?

197
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:49,726
Wait...

198
00:12:56,116 --> 00:13:00,416
Don't get injured because of me.

199
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:04,646
But saying I'm injured is an overstatement.

200
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,246
To be honest,

201
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:21,896
it's my birthday today.

202
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:24,676
What? Really?

203
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,136
Yes.

204
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,686
It's both my birthday,

205
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:35,506
and the death anniversary...

206
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:38,576
of my parents.

207
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:47,156
On my seventh birthday,

208
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:52,246
my parents went to get me a present,

209
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:54,976
and got involved in a traffic accident.

210
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:59,626
"We're leaving now."

211
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,706
"See you later."

212
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:07,626
"Don't make any detours, and quickly come home."

213
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:11,656
Like that,

214
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:15,686
it was the start of any normal day,

215
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:22,376
but it didn't end normally like I wanted.

216
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,516
Since then,

217
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:34,446
my birthday became a day that wasn't fun.

218
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,626
But...

219
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:42,896
until last year,

220
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:45,716
my grandma would prepare a cake for me.

221
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,236
It wasn't much, but she celebrated it for me.

222
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,546
That's why,

223
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,886
I didn't feel lonely.

224
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:01,546
But...

225
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,406
my grandma, too...

226
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:08,386
is no longer around.

227
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,546
So subconsciously,

228
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:18,146
I ended up calling you.

229
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,576
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:26,356
Thank you.

231
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,816
Huh?

232
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:34,246
For telling me this.

233
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:43,026
You called me Hikaru just now, right?

234
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:48,286
Sorry, I justー

235
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,224
I'm really happy,

236
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:52,966
Yumeko.

237
00:15:54,896 --> 00:16:00,586
<i>Unconsciously, as if it was a natural instinct, I didn't call him "Jinguji",</i>

238
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,496
<i>but "Hikaru".</i>

239
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:09,386
<i>As if I had always been calling him by that name.</i>

240
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,886
So,

241
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,456
where shall we go?

242
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:17,566
Is there anything you feel like eating? Or something you want?

243
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:21,296
Just running over to meet me is more than enough.

244
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:24,436
Since I ran all the way here, say something.

245
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:31,036
In that case, can you grant just one wish of mine?

246
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,636
What is it?

247
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:46,376
We'll hold hands like this for today.

248
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:51,556
Got it.

249
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:15,601
If you had told me earlier it's your birthday today,

250
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,046
I would have prepared a cake.

251
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,946
I'm a professional in sweets, so I'm even more annoyed.

252
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,066
Sorry.

253
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:27,496
Oh, right.

254
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,056
Ta-da!

255
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:47,576
The improvised profiterole is ready!

256
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:49,556
This is...

257
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:55,309
It's a French celebratory dessert where you stack up cream puffs on top of one another.

258
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,845
Happy birthday.

259
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,086
You don't like it?

260
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:04,650
It does look a little crooked, right?

261
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,556
Sorry, I'm not really good at doing this.

262
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,476
Next time, I'll get you a much more high-class oneー

263
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:24,326
Thank you very much.

264
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:30,056
I'm really, really happy.

Senior! Why are youー

278
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:33,016
You were acting strangely just now, so I was worried.
