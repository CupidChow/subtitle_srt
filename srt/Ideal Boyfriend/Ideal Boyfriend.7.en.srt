1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,610
Why are you here?

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,410
I came to tell you something, Old Lady.

3
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:11,208
Come with me.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,200
What do you want? You'll be in trouble if someone takes a photo of you.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,350
I've come to return the money Hikaru owes you.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,750
Huh?

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,800
With this, your love contract ends here.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,330
Did you ask Hikaru about this?

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,040
Hikaru?

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,167
You two must have been really close.

11
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,904
You're not even his real girlfriend.

12
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:42,210
It's true that I lent him money on the condition that he be my boyfriend.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,100
But that's between the both of us.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,410
The money too. I shouldn't be taking this from you.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,430
Do you like Hikaru?

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,510
Well...

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,960
Have you gotten it wrong here?

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,260
Because you like Hikaru, you think he also likes you back?

19
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:13,170
Unfortunately, he doesn't have any feelings for you.

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,577
That's because, to Hikaru, you're nothing but a reference for his manga.

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,648
What do you mean?

22
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:25,270
- Hikaru is a web manga artist.
- Manga artist?

23
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,740
Aoi!

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,210
What are you doing?

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,230
You're all over the internet!

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,960
Hey Old Lady, go read the web manga called "Ideal Boyfriend."

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,610
Hikaru is the author of that manga.

Aoi!

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,240
This is the manga you drew, right?

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,100
Why didn't you tell me you've started on a new story?

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,780
How did you know?

34
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,860
Of course, I know.

35
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,706
I've been looking at your drawings for years.

36
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,570
But why did you write under a female pen name?

37
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,270
My editor told me to do that.

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,200
The protagonist is a female,

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,250
so it'd be more real if the pen name is also female.

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,740
It gives a more real feeling indeed.

41
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,370
After all, this is non-fiction based on the love contract between you and the old granny, right?

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,700
How did you know about the love contract?

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,340
I heard from this guy called Toma.

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,040
But that old lady seemed rather shocked.

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,829
Could it be... you told Yumeko about this?

46
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,569

48
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,560

Jeez... how careless of you.

50
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,810
Huh? You've also started reading that manga?

51
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,550
This was the manga you previously mentioned, right?

52
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,290
That's right.

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,060
What's the story about?

54
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,810
How should I put it?

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,100
The heroine was about to get married when she was suddenly dumped by her fiancé.

56
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,660
At the airport, she met a man, who asked her to lend him money,

57
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,102
and they got into a love contract.

58
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:40,310
Wait. Love contract. That means...

Hey! W-Wait!

63
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,860
Yumeko.

64
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,010
This...

65
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,620
is drawn by you?

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,820
Did you...

68
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,890
use me as a reference for your manga?

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,390
What?!

70
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,780
Let me talk to her alone.

71
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,830
Please.

72
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,400
You read it?

73
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,930
I was afraid, so I didn't.

74
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,370
I should have told you earlier.

76
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,970
About what?

77
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,700
That you got into a love contract with me so you could use me as a reference for your manga?

78
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,540
- That's not true.
- You must find it funny, right?

79
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,120
Just one word from you, and I was happy and got swayed.

80
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,020
I wouldn't such a thing.

81
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,450
- Please, just let me explainー
- If you'd wanted to deceive me,

82
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,150
it would've been fine if it was all a lie.

83
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,766
Why...

84
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,400
Why didn't you say it was all an act?

85
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,850
After all, we're just fooling around with each other.

86
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,970
It would have been great

87
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:38,280
if you had left me with sweet memories.

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,820
It would have been fine if you had just stayed as Jinguji!

89
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,980

Tell me everything.

96
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,290
I won't ask you what happened.

97
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,550
I just... don't want you to push yourself too much.

98
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,700
Be it hurtful feelings, or sad feelings,

99
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,000
I hope you'll vent them out instead of hiding them.

100
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,970
Don't worry.

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,470
It's okay to cry in front of me.

102
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,523
I wish to speak with Yumeko.

103
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,220
Could you let us be alone?

104
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,330
The incident with Aoi Miki...

105
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,920
That idol appearing at my office... has that also got to do with you?

106
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,210
About that, I plan to explain to Yumeko-

107
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,470
It happened at the workplace that's important to Onodera.

108
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,630
Do you even understand how she felt back then?

109
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,310
On top of that, you did something again to make her cry.

110
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,470
The one who should leave right now, is you.

111
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,780
A date with the president?!

112
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,000
We're just having tea and doing some shopping.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,150
So you've given up on diversifying your interests,

114
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,000
and just focus on the president, correct?

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,330
I don't know what lies ahead, but you may be right.

116
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:10,380
Indeed, Jinguji may have been your ideal boyfriend who's at the top of the school pecking order,

117
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,760
but choosing the high-spec President Mizukami is also a given, huh?

118
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,520
I don't choose men by how high their specs are anyway.

119
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,270
No need for lip service between us.

120
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,030
But then, your interest in Hikaru has taken a huge dip.

121
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,630
Have you read it?

122
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,910
His girlfriend is an idol,

123
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,690
what's worse, he lied to you and made you as a reference for his manga.

124
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,617
Of course, you should cut him off.

125
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,680
Everything's fine now.

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,130
I was only fooling around with him anyway.

127
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,420
I guess the only thing ideal about him is his looks.

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,400

He won't answer my calls, and wouldn't reply my messages.

You were the one who leaked that photo, right?

When I was 18, Hikaru and I took the night bus and came to Tokyo.

147
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,380
We promised each other that we will fulfill our dreams, and go home in a limousine one day.

148
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:21,460
Despite that, why wouldn't he fall in love with me?

150
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,510

When your nails are pretty, you'll feel much better too.

166
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,116
I've been curious for a long time.

167
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:29,720
Why did such a nice guy like you fall for me?

168
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,670
When I was young, the only person who didn't laugh at me, was you.

169
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,371
Instead of robots, I liked playing with dress-up dolls,

170
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,370
so everyone always made fun of me.

171
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:54,510
But you said, "What's wrong with boys liking pretty and cute things?"

172
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,170
"It's cool that Toma dares to say out loud what he likes!"

173
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,110
Did I say that?

174
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,140
Yes, you did.

175
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,659
I've been liking you for ten years.

176
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,996
For the next ten years,

177
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,398
I'll still continue to like you.

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,860
That's why... I want you to be happy, Yumeko.

179
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,300
Toma...

180
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,530
Yumeko,

181
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,640
why don't you read his manga?

182
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,110
The Yumeko I like, is in there.

183
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,590
Jeez...

184
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,080
Guess I'm also an idiot, huh?

185
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,960
Yumeko...

186

<i>[Ideal Boyfriend]</i>

187
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,190
<i>- Please take it and go to your grandmother's.</i>
<i>- Eh?</i>

188
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,980
<i>Don't bother.</i>

189
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,380
<i>I'm happy to see you.</i>

190
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,230
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

191
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,090
<i>Things will turn out fine.</i>

192
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,660
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

193
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,200
<i>Here.</i>
<i>[Charm]</i>

194
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,210
<i>I hope your project will go smoothly.</i>

195
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,457
Hikaru.

196
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:16,077
Hold out your hand.

197
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,797
Huh?

198
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,067
To replenish your blood sugar.

199
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,687
I haven't eaten it in years,

200
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:30,887
but I finally ate one that day and got hooked on it.

201
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,317
Yumeko...

202
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:42,167
Go ahead and explain. I'm listening.

203
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:59,337
I told you that Aoi is my childhood friend and comrade.

204
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:03,647
But I was avoiding Aoi and didn't want to face her feelings.

205
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:07,587
Even though I'm aware of her feelings for me.

206
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,167
That's why...

207
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:12,455
this is my fault.

208
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:19,767
Also, I should have told you earlier about the manga.

209
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:24,877
I came to Tokyo, with a dream of being a manga artist.

210
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,087
I managed to debut somehow,

211
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,367
but I couldn't draw a story that I was satisfied with.

212
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:36,117
The more I panicked,

213
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,287
I more I didn't know what to draw.

214
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:45,587
At that moment, I met you, Yumeko.

215
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:53,049
Initially, I wrote the story about you and me for my own sake.

216
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:59,307
But when I tried my luck and showed it to the editor,

217
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:03,537
she said it was not bad, and suggested publishing it.

218
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:07,157
<i>Your new story is not bad.</i>

219
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:10,217
<i>Themes with love contracts are not uncommon,</i>

220
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:12,077
<i>but the heroine is lively,</i>

221
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:16,637
<i>and the on-off relationship between the two is not bad at all.</i>

222
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:18,657
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

223
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:22,237
<i>The manga you draw has changed somewhat.</i>

224
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:24,217
<i>In a good way.</i>

225
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:31,047
<i>It's probably thanks to someone that I could change it.</i>

226
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,777
It was that time...

227
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:41,377
I think I got greedy.

228
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:47,947
It was the first time I was praised for my work.

229
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:52,857
I've read it.

230
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:54,357
Huh?

231
00:16:55,417 --> 00:17:01,447
In the beginning, I was angry that you used me as a reference without my permission.

232
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:06,147
But as I read on,

233
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:12,007
I realized that you wrote it with all your heart about the things that happened between us.

234
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:13,787
And I'm happy.

235
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:17,437
Yumeko.

236
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,847
The series is still ongoing, right?

237
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:24,887
I wonder what will happen as the story progresses.

238
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,767
Will it have a happy ending like we see in fairy tales?

239
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,467
Or maybe...

240
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,697
<i>Fairy tales always end with a happy ending.</i>

241
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:40,717
<i>But in reality, the story still continues after that happy ending.</i>

242
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:45,907
<i>The romance that I wish will continue forever, will come to an end.</i>

243
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:47,687
<i>That's why...</i>

244
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,737
Let's put our love contract

245
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,597
to an end.

246
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,347
Huh?

247
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:05,557
All this while, thanks for playing the role of Jinguji.

248
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:12,357
But... in the end,

249
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,637
you can never be that person.

251
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:30,297
This 50,000 yen is a little crumpled.

252
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:33,177
Sorry about that.

253
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:37,447
You said I could return it to you anytime.

254
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,427
But I've been holding it all this while.

255
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,537
With this,

256
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,007
the contract has ended.

257
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:57,597
Goodbye, and take care.

258
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,557
Goodbye,

259
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,547
Yumeko.

260
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>We ended things just like this.</i>

261
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:32,336
<i>The cowardly me didn't want to know the reason for my overflowing tears.</i>

Please. Help me look for him.

266
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,123
No way.

267
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:56,349
Let's get married.

268
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:59,312
Is it really like what is written in the manga?
