00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,060
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,790
Has anyone been inside the archive?

4
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:30,920
Did any of you notice?

5
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:31,823
Sir.

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,554
No, we did not.

7
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,169
Three hundred years ago,

8
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:48,823
King Lan Yue of Manbo

9
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:50,862
married Princess Guan Xinrui
in a political union.

10
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:53,246
Before his death,

11
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:56,323
the King used his own blood
to curse the Golden Snake,

12
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,054
swearing that across lifetimes,

13
00:00:58,054 --> 00:01:00,015
the Princess would never
escape his wrath.

14
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:04,477
(I never knew such a legend existed.)

15
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,454
Second Princess.

16
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,031
From the first moment we met,

17
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:58,493
I sensed something about you

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
that felt different

19
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,070
from everyone else.

20
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,262
Not just different,

21
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,685
I seem to have a certain charm
that draw you in.

22
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:16,800
It seems

23
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:19,723
there is something between us,

24
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:21,993
a connection best described as

25
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:23,723
being on the same wavelength.

26
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:29,070
(Darn woman.)

27
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:31,300
(If it were not for the money,)

28
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:32,916
(I would have ended you myself.)

29
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,647
(Zhong Cheng.)

30
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:50,377
(Why is he here?)

31
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:53,762
Have you come to your senses?

32
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,608
You are completely useless.

33
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:59,377
Did you not promise
to snatch every deal from Guan Mengmeng?

34
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,416
If you fail again,

35
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,608
do not bother staying in Manbo.

36
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:06,685
Get out.

37
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,262
I knew it.

38
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:29,223
Someone as hollow as Zhong Cheng

39
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,416
could never pull this off on his own.

40
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,723
So it turns out

41
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,877
you are calling the shots.

42
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:37,762
So what if I was?

43
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,416
Your identity is fabricated.

44
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,685
I even suspect

45
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,223
your marriage to Song Pai
is just as false.

46
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,839
I intend to make a fraud like you

47
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,839
realize when to back down.

48
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,839
And disappear
from the Manbo royal family.

49
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:59,993
Instead of wasting your energy
trying to drive me out,

50
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,493
you should focus on raising
the relief funds.

51
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,185
After all,

52
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,493
if the First Prince secures
the five hundred million first,

53
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,770
the one who will have to leave
will not be me.

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,723
It will be you.

55
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:15,377
We will see

56
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:17,454
how this ends.

57
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:22,990
Waiting and watching will not cut it.

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,090
If you want to keep up,
you have to start running.

59
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:30,916
Yes.

60
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,570
That is it.

61
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:32,608
Keep going.

62
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,493
Pick up the pace.

63
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,531
Hello everyone.

64
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,647
This is your girl, Xiaodoli Mengmeng.

65
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,339
Yes.

66
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,493
Xiaodoli, in the Dai language,

67
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:55,877
means beautiful girl.

68
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:00,108
That is right.

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,900
I am live right now from the royal palace
of the Manbo Kingdom.

70
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:08,493
I started this livestream

71
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:11,993
because Manbo has been
hit hard by flooding.

72
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,377
We are raising relief funds

73
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,800
to help the victims
get through this crisis.

74
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,070
So please show Mengmeng lots of support.

75
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,877
"We will support you."

76
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,877
Thank you so much, everyone.

77
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:28,954
I truly appreciate it.

78
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,685
Now let us move on to our first product.

79
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:35,108
Boss.

80
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:37,560
That looks like the First Princess,
Guan Mengmeng.

81
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,490
Final ten seconds before orders close.

82
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,685
If we break

83
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,954
ten thousand orders,

84
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:44,877
I will unveil

85
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,454
the mystery of the First Prince's

86
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:49,185
private sleeping quarters for everyone.

87
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,185
Let us start the countdown.

88
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:55,877
Ten.

89
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,877
Nine.

90
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:01,608
Eight.

91
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:07,454
Oh my god.

92
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:09,762
The order count
just crossed twenty thousand.

93
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:14,762
You want to see
the First Prince's childhood moments?

94
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:20,916
Say no more.

95
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,570
I have got you covered.

96
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,993
Guan Mengmeng.

97
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,108
Boss, wait for me.

98
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:27,877
My phone.

99
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
It is right here.

100
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,834
Anyone wants to see it?

101
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:34,988
If you do,

102
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:37,257
type 666 in the chat.

103
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:42,103
Let me check.

104
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,219
Let me see who is posting.

105
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,065
Wow.

106
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:47,488
So many of you are interested.

107
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:49,757
Alright then,

108
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:50,988
let us reveal it.

109
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,603
Guan Mengmeng.

110
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,411
What do you think you are doing?

111
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:03,526
Song Pai.

112
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:04,334
Why are you here?

113
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:06,065
I thought the First Prince
was far too busy

114
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:07,565
to show up in person.

115
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:08,757
You almost scared me.

116
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,334
If I had not come back,

117
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,780
you would have sold everything I own.

118
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:13,411
Do not exaggerate.

119
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:14,449
Our livestream

120
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,257
never sells used underwear.

121
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,334
How did you know I was live?

122
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
Were you secretly watching?

123
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:23,449
I am curious whether this really works.

124
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:24,680
Of course it does.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,449
This is one of the most popular ways
to make money right now.

126
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,380
As long as you pick the right products
and know how to sell them,

127
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,334
you could do it too.

128
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,526
Then let me see your stream.

129
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,190
Let me take a look.

130
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,296
No way.

131
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,257
Mengmeng.

132
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,490
Guan Mengmeng, stop right there.

133
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:42,257
Mengmeng.

134
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,719
Stop.

135
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:45,642
Mengmeng.

136
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,334
Hand it over.

137
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,796
Are you really that scared of me?

138
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,257
A prince doing livestream sales,
that is impressive.

139
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:25,834
Let me see.

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,580
(Livestream ended.)

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,449
So this is what you meant
by the hottest livestream trend?

142
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:52,180
Lin Ge.

143
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:53,296
Have some more.

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,180
You will need the strength
to raise funds.

145
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,449
Thank you, Mother.

146
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,296
Nana.

147
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,580
You should eat too.

148
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,680
You worked hard
on this round of fundraising.

149
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,026
I remember you saying
you still had matters to attend to.

150
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:10,757
Yes, Mother.

151
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:12,219
I do.

152
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:13,411
I will take my leave now.

153
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,757
Mother, what are you doing?

154
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:25,949
Do you know how much Nana raised?

155
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:27,334
It was just a pastry.

156
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:29,180
Silly child.

157
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:30,680
She is your wife.

158
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:32,757
Helping you is only natural.

159
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,810
You cannot let her grow complacent
because of favor.

160
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,526
There is no point arguing with you.

161
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:39,719
You…

162
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,373
My mother treated you like that.

163
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:53,680
Why did you not speak up?

164
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:54,719
Speak up?

165
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,296
With what standing?

166
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:00,065
My family still relies
on your mother's support.

167
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,796
No matter how unreasonable she is,

168
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,296
I have no choice but to endure it.

169
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:04,719
But one day,

170
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,488
I will be strong enough
that I will not have to.

171
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:14,700
You are my Princess Consort.

172
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:16,980
I do not want you treated this way.

173
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:18,988
Even if it is my mother,

174
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:22,065
I will not allow your dignity
to be humiliated.

175
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:27,565
When you can truly shoulder
your own responsibilities,

176
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:29,680
then talk to me about dignity.

177
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:39,411
One day,

178
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:41,911
I will protect you.

179
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
What are you doing?

180
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,670
I am just pulling the blanket over you.

181
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:03,670
Heh.

182
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,554
Do you believe that?

183
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,323
Do you like me that much?

184
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:26,016
Put the phone down.

185
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,850
I will let you
get it out of your system.

186
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:30,939
Song Pai.

187
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,439
There is really no need for this.

188
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,170
Feels pretty nice.

189
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:39,785
Ah.

190
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:40,477
I like it.
