1
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:26,020
=Manbo Destiny=

2
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,980
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:35,823
What's wrong?

4
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:39,785
I want to add a few clauses.

5
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,977
What do you want to add?

6
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:45,285
Clause Four.

7
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,592
No using violence at will.

8
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:48,285
Okay.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,208
Clause Five.

10
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,390
Anything related to the succession fight

11
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,977
must be fully disclosed.

12
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:55,746
No hiding anything.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,092
Fine.

14
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:58,823
Clause Six.

15
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:00,785
Once this is over,

16
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:02,208
we're done for good.

17
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,169
That's all?

18
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:07,400
That's all.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,332
Baofan.

20
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:09,371
Yes.

21
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,217
Bring out the contract.

22
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:13,948
Alright.

23
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:17,486
(Song Pai,
this is just a deal between us.)

24
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:18,140
(Right?)

25
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,794
(Parting ways cleanly
is the best ending.)

26
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:22,871
Boss, bad news!

27
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:24,486
The contract is gone!

28
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:26,871
What?

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,911
Guan Mengmeng.

30
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:44,718
So you really are a fake.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,116
How could this happen?

32
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,962
We're done for.

33
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:02,193
Boss, bad news!

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,060
His Majesty summons you
and the First Princess.

35
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,116
The contract?

36
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:17,962
What contract?

37
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:19,231
Yes.

38
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:22,193
The two of them worked together
to deceive Your Majesty.

39
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:24,962
Mother.

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,500
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,270
Father,

42
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,770
my brother would never do that.

43
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:30,308
I may dislike Guan Mengmeng,

44
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,270
but this is treason.

45
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:37,000
Father.

46
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,116
I've been wronged.

47
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,000
Queen.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,577
The contract you mentioned,

49
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,308
do you have proof?

50
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:03,423
It's already prepared.

51
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,116
Your Majesty, please summon one person.

52
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:10,654
Come in.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,116
So it was Wen Shanna who stole it.

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,411
Everything about the contract
has been arranged.

55
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:06,065
The Second Princess is ready.

56
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:10,680
We can finally bring Song Pai down.

57
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,027
I didn't expect Wen Shanna

58
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:15,027
to actually be useful.

59
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,565
The Second Princess
has also put in a lot of effort.

60
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:21,911
What?

61
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,834
You seem rather fond
of this Second Princess.

62
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:27,642
I am only

63
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,757
thinking of the Second Prince.

64
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,488
There can be no threats around Lin Ge.

65
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,411
Once this is done,

66
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,411
that Second Princess

67
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,219
and the family behind her

68
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:45,757
must not be spared.

69
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,757
(I've worked myself
to the bone for you,)

70
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,296
(cleaning up your dirty work.)

71
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:55,603
(Since you're heartless,)

72
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,257
(don't blame me for being ruthless.)

73
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:13,603
And you just...

74
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,680
You destroyed
the chance to bring me down.

75
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,180
Consider this a show of goodwill.

76
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,719
But

77
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:25,565
you must promise me one thing.

78
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,334
Protect my family forever.

79
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,334
As for the Queen,

80
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,027
I'll handle her.

81
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:33,988
That's easy enough.

82
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:35,219
Still, this act

83
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,334
has to be played through to the end.

84
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:43,758
My dear Queen,

85
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:45,720
where's the contract?

86
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,566
Where's the evidence?

87
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:49,489
Wen Shanna,

88
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:50,681
what's going on?

89
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,720
Did Guan Mengmeng
and Song Pai threaten you?

90
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
I…

91
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:07,181
(Heh.)

92
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,758
(You're the only one
who's ever threatened me,)

93
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,143
(Queen.)

94
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:16,643
It's okay.

95
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,681
I'm here.

96
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:18,489
Go on.

97
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:21,335
Yes.

98
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:25,373
Who exactly threatened you?

99
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,643
You'd better tell us.

100
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,258
Wen Shanna.

101
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:35,104
Speak up. Don't be afraid.

102
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:42,681
Second Princess.

103
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,527
Tell the truth
about what really happened.

104
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:51,258
I'll stand up for you.

105
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,450
(Lin Ge, I'm sorry.)

106
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,220
Your Majesty,

107
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:05,989
it was the...

108
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:07,412
It was me.

109
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,412
Maka, you...

110
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,412
I was misled by slander
and wanted credit too badly.

111
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,604
I misled Her Majesty

112
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,681
and the Second Princess,

113
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:27,143
saying that I had

114
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,720
a contract between
the First Prince and the First Princess.

115
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:33,335
I'm sorry, Queen.

116
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:35,950
I'm sorry, First Princess.

117
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,027
I'm sorry, Second Princess.

118
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:41,989
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,758
Maka, why would you do this?

120
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,335
You...

121
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:49,066
Your Majesty,

122
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,758
I've served you

123
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,066
since you were young.

124
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,373
Today, I'll take my leave.

125
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:59,527
Please take care of yourself.

126
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:04,720
I bid you farewell.

127
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:14,643
Song Pai.

128
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,104
Guards.

129
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:30,604
She will await her execution.

130
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,027
Take her away.

131
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:01,720
Your Majesty,

132
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,950
this was my failure
to manage my household.

133
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,643
I ask to be punished.

134
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:08,835
Father,

135
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:10,912
Mother was deceived by the servant.

136
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,566
Please show mercy.

137
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:29,643
First Prince.

138
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:33,297
From what I see,

139
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,758
it seems they were targeting you.

140
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:39,758
So this matter...

141
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:44,643
will be handled by you.

142
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,681
Father,

143
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,373
I believe

144
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:53,989
the Queen truly was misled.

145
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,912
Then, this matter

146
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:01,143
should end here.

147
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,066
Did you all hear that?

148
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,373
Look at our First Prince.

149
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:09,335
See how generous he is?

150
00:10:13,643 --> 00:10:14,604
Then,

151
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,027
we'll do as you suggest.

152
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:19,527
This matter is settled.

153
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,027
You may all

154
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:27,527
rise.

155
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,258
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

156
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:31,873
No need to thank me.

157
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,527
If anything, thank the First Prince.

158
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:39,258
Your Majesty,

159
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:40,758
I have some good news.

160
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,566
In Xishuangbanna, China,

161
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:45,873
there will soon be
an international e-commerce summit.

162
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,297
The First Prince and I plan to attend.

163
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:51,412
We hope this will double
the results of our fundraising.

164
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:53,758
Father,

165
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:55,143
I want to go as well.

166
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,066
Lin Ge,

167
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:59,989
you should stay in Manbo and
assist your father with state affairs.

168
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:01,220
Father,

169
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,027
I would also like to go.

170
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,643
That way, I can support Lin Ge.

171
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,297
Father,

172
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:10,835
please let Lin Ge and me go.

173
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:12,643
We can look out for each other.

174
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:16,450
Alright.

175
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:20,297
Song Pai,

176
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:22,720
we will do as you suggest.

177
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:24,527
Go to China.

178
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:27,527
You two,

179
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,527
as princes who care for the people,

180
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,873
make me very pleased.

181
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,873
Go and return safely.

182
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:38,027
I will be waiting for good news.

183
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,527
- Yes.
- Yes.

184
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:48,180
(Xishuangbanna, China)

185
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,027
Xishuangbanna, I'm back!

186
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,912
Hurry up, you two!

187
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,989
Slow down, Mengmeng.

188
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:17,989
This place feels amazing.

189
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:23,220
Now that Mengmeng has
a Lancang-Mekong visa,

190
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:26,489
it'll be much easier for us
to come back to China for business.

191
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,104
I'll come back with you more often.

192
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:30,450
You'd better keep your word.

193
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:33,335
The scenery there is beautiful.

194
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,510
I want to go take some photos

195
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,104
and bring them back
for Princess Wanida.

196
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:41,450
You two go ahead.

197
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:42,912
We've got things to do.

198
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,104
Yeah.

199
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:45,220
We're going on a date.

200
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:48,989
A date?

201
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:50,143
Alright then.

202
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,450
I'll send you the address
of the Zixia Fairy Guesthouse.

203
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,873
Bye.

204
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,220
Enjoy your date.

205
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:05,450
Nana, you feel different here
compared to Manbo.

206
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,181
What, you don't like it?

207
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:10,873
I like it. I really do.

208
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,104
Let's go on a date.

209
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:16,066
Who has time for a date?
We're already in China.

210
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,758
You want all the credit
to go to Song Pai?

211
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:20,335
I'm meeting with a few clients.

212
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,912
Nana, you're always thinking about me.

213
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,027
I'm really touched.

214
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:27,181
Don't flatter yourself.

215
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,335
I'm doing this for myself, not for you.

216
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:32,681
Bye.

217
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,989
Mean with a kind heart.

218
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:38,335
Wait for me.

219
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,373
Mm, okay.

220
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,527
Let's leave it there.

221
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,335
I'll handle it when I'm back.

222
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:00,873
Mengmeng?

223
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,027
Mengmeng?

224
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:12,835
Mengmeng?

225
00:14:14,873 --> 00:14:15,912
Mengmeng?

226
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:18,835
Mengmeng?

227
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:21,450
Mengmeng?
