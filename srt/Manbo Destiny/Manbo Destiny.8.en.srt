3
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,550
Mr. Li.

4
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,360
Mr. Xia.

5
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,710
Let us call it a day.

6
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,090
Another time,

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,180
I will visit you personally
to discuss the contract.

8
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,020
Sure.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,320
You two go ahead.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,860
Mr. Li.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,550
Mr. Xia.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,900
Zhong Cheng.

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,250
How dare a lowly commoner

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,130
address the First Princess by name.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,050
You are nothing but a fake Princess.

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,550
We were together for five years.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,590
You think I do not know who you are?

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,090
Zhong Cheng.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,900
The daughter of Guan Yongchun?

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,670
Give me a break.

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,820
Answer me.

22
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,940
That information was sealed.

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,090
How did you get it?

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,480
Answer me.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,860
I knew the truth long ago.

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,480
Guan Mengmeng, listen carefully.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Today, I will see you brought to tears.

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,480
Boss.

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,700
Why did you not tell the First Princess

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,250
that you canceled the finance meeting

31
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,940
and booked a seaside restaurant

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,250
just to see her?

33
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,210
Shut up.

34
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,170
Say the word date again,

35
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,520
and you will lose your head.

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,210
I only wanted

37
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,790
to discuss a few matters with her.

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,670
Yet you have been
waiting here for hours.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,900
Men.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,670
Seize this woman.

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,320
Who sent you?

42
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,250
Let go.

43
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,050
Let go.

44
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,520
Do not move.

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,790
Boss, something is wrong.

46
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,990
The First Princess is in danger.

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,050
Let me go.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,550
Zhong Cheng.

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,630
Take him down.

50
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,290
Song Pai.

51
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,670
Who is it?

52
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,050
Why are you here?

53
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:35,710
Are you hurt?

54
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,480
Let me be clear.

55
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,130
Stay away from Guan Mengmeng.

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,090
Get him.

57
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,080
That is enough, Mengmeng.

58
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,280
Stop drinking.

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
Do not stop me.

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,580
I am not done yet.

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,850
Enough, Mengmeng.

62
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,970
Alright.

63
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,850
That is enough.

64
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,050
Enough already.

65
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,390
That is enough.

66
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,160
Mengmeng.

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,550
He is not worth it.

68
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,310
This is about me.

69
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,160
I cannot believe

70
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,850
I was so blind.

71
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,620
I spent five years with him.

72
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,350
Looking back,
it was not worth it at all.

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,780
Mengmeng.

74
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,890
That bastard, Zhong Cheng.

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,890
He almost destroyed my life,

76
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,620
and now he is back
to sabotage my business.

77
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,930
Do not cry.

78
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,580
Mengmeng.

79
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,700
It is alright now.

80
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,890
Song Pai.

81
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,660
Does a dark past

82
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,080
really trap someone for life?

83
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,810
It is over now.

84
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,470
Let us go home.

85
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,580
We are home.

86
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,390
Mengmeng.

87
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,160
Mengmeng.

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,080
Slow down.

89
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,930
Careful.

90
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,200
Do not touch me.

91
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,740
I am already married.

92
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,510
No other man

93
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,550
gets to lay a hand on me.

94
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,240
I am not just anyone.

95
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,660
I am your husband.

96
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,510
Your lawful husband.

97
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,580

you check in with me, alright?

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Do not do this again.

104
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,970
Do you hear me?

105
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,470
You talk too much.

106
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,550
Listen.

107
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,510
I will secure this deal.

108
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,780

much easier for you.

I am sorry.

I should never
have pulled you into this.

112
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,580
This was my decision.

113
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,890
It is not on you.

114
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,780
Then tell me next time.

115
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,310
Do not carry it all by yourself.

116
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,970
Alright?

117

You are the First Prince.

118

119

be doing things like this.

No.

122
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,850
I am not the same.

123
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,430
I am just a placeholder.

124
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,890
A fake.

125
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,890
Once the three months are over,

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,850
I take my money,

127
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,970

Why are you looking at that?

175
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,550
Are you planning to start a company too?

176
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,200
There is a Chinese saying.

When do you plan to make your move?

183
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,930
I have already worked out

184
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,780
a way to generate profits
through real-sector investments.

185
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,240
In less than six months,

186
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,740
we can make two hundred million
in net profit.

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,350
You sound very confident.

188
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,550
Then I suppose

189
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,970
I will wait and see.

190
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,780

195
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,200

196
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,240
What are you doing?

197
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,310
Hold it steady.

198
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,810
Do not throw me off.

199
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,280
What?

200
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,550
You are giving up already?

201
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,310
Who says I am?

202
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,810
Four hundred ninety-nine.

203
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,810
Five hundred.

204
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,930
Why are you standing so close?

205
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,700
What is happening?

206
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,120
Why is my heart racing?

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
I need to see a doctor.

208
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,310
Doctor.

209
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,620
Doctor.

210
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,550
(What exactly is Song Pai's connection
to the man in my dreams?)

211
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,350
(Why would I have that dream at all?)

212
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,120
Mengmeng.

213
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,390
Do not come any closer.

214
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,160
Can we talk about
what happened last night?

215
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,850
Mengmeng, I am sorry.

216
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,990
Your Highness, if there is nothing else,

217
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,390
I will take my leave.

218
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,430
You will not even give me
a chance to explain?

219
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,280
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

220
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,390
I will earn the money
as quickly as possible

221
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,730
and help you secure
the position of heir to the throne.

222
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,200
(It is only a business arrangement.)

223
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,390
(Once it is over,
I take the money and leave.)

224
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,890
(Nothing else matters to me.)

225
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,350
Who gave you the right
to wipe out my entire family?

226
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,080
You deceived the future Queen.

227
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,970
You deserve to die.

228
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,310
Please, let him go.

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,930
What is this Golden Snake really about?

230
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,980
Lan Yue.

231
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:07,940
Boss.

232
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,300
What did you find?

233
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,630
Boss.

234
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,860
The Golden Snake

235
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,360
has been around for centuries.

236
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,670
I also uncovered records
from three hundred years ago

237
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,190
about the King and Queen of that time.

238
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,210
Go on.

239
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,600
It is a strange coincidence.

240
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,010
The King was named Lan Yue,

241
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,510
one of your ancestors.

242
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,550
The Queen was Guan Xinrui.

243
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,490
Like the First Princess,

244
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,400
she was from China.

245
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,710
Continue.

246
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,940
Three hundred years ago,

247
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,940
King Lan Yue married Princess Guan Xinrui
through a political alliance.

248
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,090
The entire nation celebrated.

249
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,210
But shortly after the wedding,

250
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,280
for reasons no one knows,

251
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,360
the King suddenly
had the Princess imprisoned.

252
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,710
In the end, both of them died together.

253
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,480
According to legend, before his death,

254
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,320
the King used his own blood
to curse the Golden Snake,

255
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,810
vowing that the Princess would never
escape him, lifetime after lifetime.

256
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,050
So that would mean

257
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,710
the Golden Snake may only be a legend.

258
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,900
Where is the First Princess?

259
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,580
Are you alright, Mengmeng?

260
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,740
I am sorry.

261
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,590
Why are you here?

262
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,050
Are you hurt?

263
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,590
Where are you trying to go?

264
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,520
What are you trying to do?

265
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,590
I am sorry.

266
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,010
I do not know why I lost control.

267
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,130
But last night,

268
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,320
I saw the necklace glowing.

269
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,860
You saw it glow too?

270
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,550
Did anyone else see it?

271
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,590
The woman who runs the orphanage
once told me

272
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,510
she found me as a baby

273
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,320
because of this necklace.

274
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,820
It was glowing in the dark.

275
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,400
So

276
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,900
to me,

277
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,980
it is more than just a necklace.

278
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,590
It protects me.

279
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,400
It is the only thing
my parents left behind.

280
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,860
No wonder

281
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,360
it means so much to her.

282
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,000
(I should get to the bottom
of the Golden Snake's origins)

283
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,090
(before telling Mengmeng everything.)

284
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,060
♪I do this for you♪

285
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,700

286
