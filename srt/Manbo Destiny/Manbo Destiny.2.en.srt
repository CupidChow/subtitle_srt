00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,980
=Manbo Destiny=

2
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,930
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,880
Xinrui.

4
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,000
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,770
You may rise.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,730
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,270
You are drunk.

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,190
I am not.

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,030
Do you know

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,610
I have never fallen for anyone?

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,880
But your face

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,190
has already filled my heart.

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,150
Your Majesty.

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,980
(Something is wrong with her.)

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,880
(Did she have a nightmare?)

16
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,380
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,770
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,650
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,230
Let go of me! Don't touch me!

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,610
Pervert!

21
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,880
You had a nightmare.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm not interested in a woman
who sleeps like a dead pig.

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,840
Who knows if what you said is true.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,500
Who are you calling a pig?

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,230
Do I need to take advantage
of you with my status?

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,110
Your Highness.

27
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,460
I arrived late, please forgive me.

28
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,530
First Prince?

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,840
Thank you, Your Highness,
for saving my life.

30
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,500
I have no way to repay
your great kindness.

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,960
You truly want to thank me?

32
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,840
Of course.

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,620
Then marry me.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,070
(Is the First Prince crazy?)

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,730
I want you to be my Princess.

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,300
(What?)

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,460
(Me, the Princess?)

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,800
(Is he serious?)

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
I refuse.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,600
But it's only a contract

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,230
for three months.

42
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,650
As long as you help me
become Crown Prince,

43
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,570
I will let you leave.

44
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,110
There are so many women
in the royal family.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,530
Why must it be me?

46
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,420
This sounds suspicious.

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,190
Guan Mengmeng.

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,030
Twenty-five years old.

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,000
An orphan

50
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,730
from Yunnan, China.

51
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,370
Came to Manbo with boyfriend
Zhong Cheng to start a business.

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,730
Selling Chinese products
through e-commerce.

53
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,230
The company thrived.

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,300
But in the end,

55
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,380
she was betrayed by Zhong Cheng
and her best friend An Man

56
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,230
and left with nothing.

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,020
(He really knows everything about me.)

58
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,420
As expected of a prince.

59
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,810
Your reach is truly impressive.

60
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
And this.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,770
That's mine, give it back.

62
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,150
Royal approvals for new industries
are exclusive.

63
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,760
Even if you have the documents,

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,260
if the company isn't yours,

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,730
they're just useless paper.

66
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,110
What about your fiancée,

67
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,340
Princess Wen Shanna?

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,570
She was taken by my brother.

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,310
(So the First Prince got cheated
on too.)

70
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,070
Your brother is such a jerk.

71
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,270
So you're willing to help me now?

72
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,110
No.

73
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,960
That's a royal power struggle.

74
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,630
I'm just a nobody,

75
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,730
I might lose my life one day.

76
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,020
You should find someone else.

77
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,800
You won't escape.

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,210
Boss.

79
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,790
You're not going
after the Second Prince?

80
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,440
He tried to kill you.

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,020
If I pursue it,

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,210
Lin Ge will just shield
the real mastermind.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,210
Are we just going to let it go?

84
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,570
This is easy for me.

85
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,660
(This isn't what I imagined.)

86
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,610
(I can't hold on anymore.)

87
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,310
♪Over the rainbow♪

88
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,250
♪There will be the color of the love♪

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,530
(Why are you so close to me?)

90
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,260
My Princess, you're quite enthusiastic.

91
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,220
Who's your Princess?

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,110
I haven't agreed yet.

93
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,380
What's so bad about being my Princess?

94
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
I can fulfill all your demands.

95
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,110
Then at least show me your sincerity.

96
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,610
Come on.

97
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,840
Where to?

98
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,850
To show you my sincerity.

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,610
Today we're holding
a shareholders' meeting.

100
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,530
Everyone,

101
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,050
please raise your hands to vote

102
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,510
regarding the changes
to the shareholding structure.

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,410
Guan Mengmeng will no longer appear
in the company from now on.

104
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,880
I disagree.

105
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,410
The agreement is fake.

106
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,220
Sir, something has happened.

107
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,760
Someone secretly bought
all our scattered shares.

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,880
They now have actual control
over our company.

109
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,030
The leader of the e-commerce industry
in Manbo Kingdom

110
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,340
has changed hands.

111
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
Guan Mengmeng.

112
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,910
It's you.

113
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,550
Just a kind person saw your wrongdoing

114
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,420
and stepped forward.

115
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
Guan Mengmeng, you scoundrel.

116
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,680
An Man.

117
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,950
Are you okay?

118
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,530
Serves you right.

119
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,270
As for the losses you caused
to the company,

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,160
I'll give you a discount.

121
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,640
Let's just say ten million Manbo Coins.

122
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,720
The rest can be considered charity

123
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,260
for your retirement.

124
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,340
This

125
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,530
is the price of betraying me.

126
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,800
Mengmeng, I was wrong.

127
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,410
I know you will forgive me, right?

128
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,880
Give me one more chance, please.

129
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,950
Guan Mengmeng, wait for me.

130
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,840
Let go of me.

131
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,950
Mengmeng.

132
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,990
I know you will forgive me.

133
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,760
Mengmeng.

134
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,610
(Guan Mengmeng, you better not
give me a reason to catch you.)

135
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,770
(Otherwise, you'll regret it.)

136
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,910
Thanks for today.

137
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,260
No need to thank me.

138
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,260
Hey.

139
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,110
You...

140
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,240
What are you doing?

141
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,410
This money was obtained
by you through coercion and force.

142
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,490
It's illegal.

143
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,070
I'll hold it for you for now.

144
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,570
You...

145
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,680
As long as you agree
to be my contracted princess,

146
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,800
this money

147
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,610
will be transferred into your account
through legal channels.

148
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,800
How about it?

149
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,220
Isn't it worth considering?

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,490
I just don't understand.

151
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,610
Why must it be me?

152
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,140
I need you.

153
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,570
You need your right to the throne,
don't you?

154
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,340
This is the royal approval
for foreign trade.

155
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,670
I think you really need it.

156
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,450
Just consider it

157
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,840
as my sincerity in proposing to you.

158
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,340
A proposal?

159
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,530
Yes.

160
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,950
I am proposing to you.

161
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,570
Baofan.

162
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:55,700
♪You are my destiny♪

163
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,700
Stop.

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,220
Stop the music.

165
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,450
Alright, Baofan.

166
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,380
Good job.

167
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,610
Go rest for a while.

168
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,720
I just don't understand.

169
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,900
Manbo has so many noble girls.

170
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,330
Any one of them could help you
secure the right to the throne.

171
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,180
Why must it be me?

172
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,220
But you are different.

173
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,000
I see ambition for your career in you,

174
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,920
as well as planning
and execution skills.

175
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,110
(This guy's assessment of me
is actually quite accurate.)

176
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,110
I believe if we cooperate,

177
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,840
it will definitely be a win-win.

178
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,760
Win-win?

179
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,340
Is this a proposal or a bid?

180
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,680
Am I wrong?

181
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,210
No problem.

182
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,990
Very convincing.

183
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
So

184
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,680
you agreed?

185
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,730
But what if during the contract period,

186
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,660
you really fall for another girl?

187
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,360
Our royal marriages
prioritize responsibility.

188
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,950
It's not about love.

189
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,460
That's a bit childish.

190
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,110
A duty without love

191
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,950
is just a shackle.

192
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,020
Deal.

193
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,760
Deal.

194
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,450
Deal.

195
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,980
Speak.

196
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,100
Do you want to add any other conditions?

197
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,730
First,

198
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,750
you promise my e-commerce company.

199
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,160
I not only need the approval,

200
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,350
but I also need your royal status

201
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,770
to give me the greatest assistance.

202
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,200
No problem.

203
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,200
Second,

204
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,150
I want a reward
of fifteen million Manbo Coins.

205
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,950
Let's make the deposit
one and a half million Manbo Coins.

206
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,270
Okay.

207
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,860
Third,

208
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,410
during the contract period,

209
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,730
both parties are free to date,

210
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,360
and must not force the other
to do anything they dislike.

211
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,270
I disagree.

212
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,580
Why?

213
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,770
Once we become lovers,

214
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,990
it's hard to keep it a secret.

215
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,580
This could affect our contract.

216
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,540
Makes sense.

217
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,120
I have only two conditions.

218
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,190
First,

219
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,930
play your role well.

220
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,200
Be a good princess.

221
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,260
Help me succeed in becoming the heir.

222
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,100
Second,

223
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,700
the contract must not be leaked.

224
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,550
Otherwise, everything you've requested

225
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,920
will be voided.

226
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,850
Agreed.

227
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,080
Pleasant cooperation.

228
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,310
What are you doing?

229
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,850
Didn't we just agree

230
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,040
not to force each other
to do unwanted things?

231
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,930
I just want to tell you,

232
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,730
in a few days, the day to announce
the princess will come.

233
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,700
Don't make a mistake.

234
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,350
Understood?

235
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,350
Once the contract is revised,
I'll send it over to you.

236
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,700
(Jus speak up.)

237
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,730
(Why so close?)

238
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,010
(Manbo Bank)
(Transferred one million)

239
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,180
(Manbo Bank)
(five hundred thousand)

240
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,680
(Manbo Bank, on November 9 at 18:11)

241
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,300
(1,500,000 Manbo coins were
deposited into your account)

242
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,740
As expected of royalty.

243
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,340
I have money now!

244
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,650
(King of Manbo)

245
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,870
Lin Ge,

246
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,670
you have become engaged

247
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,400
to Wen Shanna.

248
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes, Father.

249
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,600
(Queen of Manbo)
Since you are engaged,

250
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,010
please, Your Majesty, allow them.

251
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,140
Since the First Prince
no longer has a fiancée,

252
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,210
please revoke the First Prince's
succession rights.

253
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,020
Father.

254
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,460
♪I do this for you♪

255
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,110
