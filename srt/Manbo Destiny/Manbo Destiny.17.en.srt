Mengmeng.

4
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,525
Pai, how are you?

5
00:00:35,217 --> 00:00:36,140
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:37,640
Are you okay?

7
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:52,023
You're the woman
who stole Guan Mengmeng's ex-boyfriend.

8
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:57,369
Why are you here?

9
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:01,408
Where is this place?

10
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:03,754
Why am I here?

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,500
Where's Mengmeng?

12
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:05,485
Guan Mengmeng?

13
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:06,638
Where's Guan Mengmeng?

14
00:01:06,754 --> 00:01:07,292
Brother.

15
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:08,985
You're finally awake.

16
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:10,908
Lin Ge.

17
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:12,908
Where am I?

18
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:14,215
What is this place?

19
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:15,523
Song Pai.

20
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:19,100
You don't seriously remember anything
about coming to Xishuangbanna, do you?

21
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:21,177
Of course I remember.

22
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:23,062
I came to Yunnan.

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,485
I was taking photos with Mengmeng.

24
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:27,946
Just the two of us.

25
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:31,523
Brother.

26
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:32,485
Song Pai, are you okay?

27
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:32,985
Song Pai?

28
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:35,985
Argh!

29
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:37,446
Song Pai!

30
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:43,908
What are you doing?

31
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:46,523
It's you.

32
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:49,100
Mengmeng.

33
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:50,946
Are you okay, Mengmeng?

34
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:53,677
I'm the real Guan Mengmeng.

35
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:56,523
How dare you!

36
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:58,023
Do not say the Princess's name!

37
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:00,062
I'm telling you,

38
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:02,600
I won't let you lay a finger
on my princess.

39
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:15,100
It's over.

40
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:19,023
What have I done to Mengmeng?

41
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:28,985

74
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:29,495
What, jealous?

75
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,995
Who's jealous?

76
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:34,495
I'm just protecting my private property.

77
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:40,495
But she just added me on WeChat.

78
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,033
Delete her.

79
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:46,956
I'm kidding.

80
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:48,764
You're obviously jealous.

81
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,533
Add whoever you want.
It's none of my business.

82
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:53,610
Don't touch me.

83
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,302
You know that

84
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:58,879
you're my only pinned contact.

85
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:01,187
I reply to your messages instantly.

86
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:05,725
And when you call,
I always let you hang up first.

87
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,533
Most importantly,

88
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:13,341
I tell you every single day
that I really love you.

89
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:29,379
What are you doing?
You can't just kiss me in public.

90
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:35,879
I'm telling you,

91
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,572
if you take photos
with other women again,

92
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,033
I'll kill you.

93
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:40,580
Alright.

94
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,725
He'll come looking for me.

95
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,764
He won't come looking for me.

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,033
He will come looking for me.

97
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,841

98
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:25,725

99
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,264
You're the person he hates the most.

100
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,995
You should give up already.

101
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,033
So, you missed me after all.

102
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:52,572
Song…

103
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,687
Mengmeng.

104
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,610
Hear me out, Mengmeng.

105
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,033
Why are you here?

106
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,918
I'm here to win back my princess.

107
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:08,764
I'm not your princess.

108
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,725
Your princess is Mengmeng.

109
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,379
Do you even know who I am?

110
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:19,995
I'm sorry, Mengmeng. I was wrong.

111
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:20,764
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:22,841
Can you forgive me?

113
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:25,995
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:28,802
Mengmeng.

115
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:34,572
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,302
Go live your life with your Mengmeng.

117
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,533
Go to your Mengmeng!

118
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:41,456
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,302
Why are you even looking for me?

120
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,533
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,310
Don't think this will
earn my forgiveness.

122
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:47,533
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:48,725
I really was wrong.

124
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,879
I don't like you anymore.

125
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:54,379
Will you forgive me?

126
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:57,533
Stay.

127
00:07:58,456 --> 00:07:59,187
Don't go.

128
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:00,956
You...

129
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,454
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

130
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:40,454
(Follow professional guidance to prepare
Yunnan mushrooms for flavour and safety)

131
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:41,338
Mengmeng.

132
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,069
You forgave him just like that?

133
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:48,146
Yeah.

134
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:50,185
Lin Ge.

135
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,146
Watch what she says.

136
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:54,031
Brother.

137
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:55,377
You got the wrong princess.

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,954
And you reprimanded her?

139
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:57,992
Are you serious right now?

140
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,762
Stop blaming Song Pai.

141
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:03,531
Okay?

142
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:05,338
I, Guan Mengmeng, can love and let go.

143
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,915
Since I've chosen to forgive him,
then I'll let it end here.

144
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,454
Let's not bring it up again, okay?

145
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:10,492
Mengmeng's the best.

146
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:12,223
Sorry, Mengmeng.

147
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:13,992
Eat. Hmph.

148
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,608
Ugh...

149
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,531
What's wrong?

150
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:17,762
Mengmeng, try this.

151
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:34,223
These mushrooms smell amazing.

152
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:37,031
Wen Shanna, try some.

153
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:40,069
- Mm!
- Is it good?

154
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,723
It's good.

155
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:43,300
Right? It's good.

156
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,609
I've seen videos online before.

157
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,571
Some mushrooms can cause
hallucinations after you eat them.

158
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:57,032
Like seeing little people.

159
00:09:58,186 --> 00:09:59,494
Relax.

160
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,994
The people handling mushrooms now
are very professional.

161
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,109
Hey.

162
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:05,186
Who handled this pot?

163
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:05,686
Me.

164
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:06,532
I did.

165
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:11,840
Smells great.

166
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:13,560
It really is delicious.

167
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:14,994
My skills are solid.

168
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,340
You handled it?

169
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,148
There shouldn't be any problem.

170
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,840
This isn't even hard.

171
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,071
Hahahahahaha!

172
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,302
My head feels a bit dizzy.

173
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:25,840
Guan Mengmeng, what now?

174
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,686
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

175
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:35,302
Hey, stop messing around.

176
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,571
Why are there two of you, Lin Ge?

177
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,494
Wait...

178
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:44,571
What's wrong with them?

179
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,455
Don't tell me you're getting dizzy too.

180
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:47,148
Lin Ge!

181
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,186
Can you all stop fooling around?

182
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:01,032
Speak.

183
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,763
What is the relationship
between you two?

184
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:08,994
Me and the county princess are
merely old acquaintances.

185
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:11,302
There is nothing improper between us.

186
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:13,302
I hope Your Majesty sees the truth.

187
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:15,186
Summon the witness.

188
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:19,917
Your Majesty.

189
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:26,494
I am the fiancée
of the diplomatic envoy, Wen.

190
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:27,878
I am Lin A'mei.

191
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,032
What did you see?

192
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,532
I...

193
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:34,763
Go on.

194
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:36,955
Speak.

195
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,494
I saw it.

196
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:40,955
Wen

197
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:43,109
and the woman

198
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:45,763
were being very intimate.

199
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,071
You wretch.

200
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:50,609
How dare you betray me.

201
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:51,725
No.

202
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,878
Guards.

203
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,994
Take this criminal away.

204
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:00,417
Execute her entire family
and feed them to the dogs.

205
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,878
Guan Xinrui. It was you.

206
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:13,917
Brother.

207
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:14,571
Mengmeng.

208
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:15,320
What are you doing?

209
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:19,225
- Why did you betray me?
- Song Pai!

210
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:20,840
Let go.

211
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,609
Guan Mengmeng.

212
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,571
Song Pai!

213
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,032
Song Pai, calm down.

214
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:31,532
Guan Xinrui.

215
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:36,455
Are you okay?

216
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,609
What happened to me?

217
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:39,071
Mengmeng, I'm sorry.

218
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,763
I'm really sorry.

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,032
We agreed on the contract
that I wouldn't hurt you.

220
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,302
I really couldn't control myself.

222
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:45,878
It's okay.

223
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,032
You must have been hallucinating.

224
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,455
That wasn't you.

225
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:50,225
Right?

226
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:51,725
Hallucination?

227
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:53,571
So that means

228
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,340
you all saw that just now too?

229
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,725
I turned into a woman.

230
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,302
She turned into a man.

231
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,609
And you became violent.

232
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,109
You all saw that too?

233
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,032
But what were we doing just now?

234
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:04,109
What really happened?

235
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:08,686
Could it be the mushrooms?

236
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:09,263
The mushrooms?

237
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:10,200
Check them. Now.

238
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:11,109
Get up.

239
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:11,840
Look.

240
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:12,571
Check them.

241
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:20,225
These...

242
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,340
These are just mushrooms.

243
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,648
So the mushrooms you mentioned

244
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,186
actually caused hallucinations?

245
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:29,378
Something's off.

246
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,225
Are these poisonous mushrooms
really that powerful?

247
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:34,994
I'm feeling dizzy.
