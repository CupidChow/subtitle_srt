00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,870
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,430
(The king's meeting hall
is so magnificent.)

4
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,910
Father.

5
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,910
Please allow me
to introduce to you my Princess.

6
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,000
(I must stay calm and composed,
absolutely must not let anything slip)

7
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,390
This is impossible.

8
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,590
Who is she?

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,270
Song Pai.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,230
You just

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,470
introduce

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,710
this young lady.

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,510
(I am Guan Mengmeng.)

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,310
(A few days ago,)

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,710
(I was still an e-commerce girl
deceived by a jerk and my best friend.)

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,150
(Now I am about to become
the Princess of Manbo Kingdom.)

17
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,390
(Of course, I'm a fake Princess.)

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,590
As long as you help me become the heir,

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,430
I will naturally let you go.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,550
(Today, facing the most powerful man)

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,950
(and his Queen)

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,870
(in this country,)

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,430
(if I say one wrong word,)

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,950
(I could lose my head.)

25
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,460
(I must stay calm.)

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,990
Father.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,750
This is my Princess,

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,190
Guan Mengmeng.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,350
She comes from China,

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,880
and is the daughter of Huasheng Group.

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,590
Really? She's the daughter
of Huasheng Group?

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,190
I've never heard of His Highness
having contact with any other women.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,070
It can't be...

34
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,110
It can't be what?

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,870
You mean

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,510
I just randomly pick a fiancée

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,550
because of your betrayal?

38
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,670
I…

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,070
I didn't mean that.

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,430
Your Highness.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,990
When will you hold a class

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,670
to teach us

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,620
how to be like you?

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,060
Rude and unreasonable, right?

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,830
What nonsense are you talking about?

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,590
What?

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,630
Do you only allow yourself
get to have affairs freely,

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,430
but don't let Song Pai find true love?

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,990
Such a double standard.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,710
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,230
Song Pai and I met

52
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,750
while studying in China

53
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,670
and recently reunited.

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,810
(Keep making up stories.)

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,950
I just realized

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,270
that Mengmeng

57
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,430
is the one I've always
been thinking about.

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,190
She's the perfect Princess for me.

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,840
Father.

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,460
I hope you will approve

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,710
my fate with Mengmeng.

62
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,350
In just a few days,

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,950
you brought back Miss Guan.

64
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,250
Song Pai.

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,920
How can you prove

66
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,710
that you two are true love?

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,230
The Queen is right,
it's only been a few days.

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,750
- Could it be fake?
- It's clearly not true love.

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,390
I think the First Prince
just wants the succession.

70
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,550
Yes, very likely.

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,560
(If I don't take it seriously,)

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,380
(I might not fool them.)

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,070
What are you doing?

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,270
I'm here to prove to you.

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,990
They kissed.

76
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,550
They really kissed.

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,190
Seems it's real.

78
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,910
It's just acting.

79
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,450
Do you think just saying it
will make everyone believe?

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,910
Anyway,

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,150
I refuse.

82
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,290
Fifty thousand yuan will be transferred
to your account immediately.

83
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,990
Just 50,000 yuan.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,310
I don't need such money.

85
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,350
One hundred thousand yuan.

86
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,880
Even...

87
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,550
Even 100,000 yuan isn't enough.

88
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
One hundred thousand yuan at a time.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,910
Ahem.

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,390
Why does that sound so weird?

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,670
Since you

92
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,110
agreed,

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,510
(Transfer successful)
you must follow through.

94
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,270
Come on.

95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,810
Let's start.

96
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,460
Come on.

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,670
No.

98
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,470
I'll do it instead.

Um.

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,710
I'd better go back and practice.

103
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,630
Let's

104
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,510

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,450
Make sure you don't mess up
in the hall tomorrow.

108
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,190
Got it.

109
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,370
♪Over the rainbow♪

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,870

Mr. Guan Yongchun.

118
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,310
Words alone are not enough.

120
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,430
Miss Guan.

121
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,950
How can you prove

122
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,270
that you are the daughter
of Huasheng Group?

123
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,030
No need to prove.

124
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,860
Song Pai.

125
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,030
Since

126
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,310
the Queen suggested it,

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,390
you should let Miss Guan

128
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,710
prove herself.

129
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,630

Could it be

131
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,950
the heiress is fake,

132
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,990
and the con artist is real?

133
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,100
I…

134
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,530
(This Queen talks too much.)

135
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,230
Guards.

136
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,930
Arrest this con artist for me.

137
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

138
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,950
Step back!

139
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,270
Second Prince,

140
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,070
seems like you really hope I'm fake.

141
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,070
You already are fake.

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,950
(Risk brings reward, take a gamble.)

143
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,390
Usually

144
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,270
I wouldn't bother proving myself.

145
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,700
But for my dear Pai,

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,020
I'm willing to give up my principle.

147
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,190
Your Majesty.

148
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,360
Do you remember the meeting

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,430
in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan

150
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,190
ten years ago?

151
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,230
That was a

152
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,470
private trip.

153
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,470
How did you know about it?

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,790
Your Majesty.

155
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,470
My father

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,550
wanted to video call you.

157
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,870
I wonder

158
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,430
if I may have this honor?

159
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,810
No need.

160
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,680
Miss Guan.

161
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,790
I believe you are the daughter

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,290
of my good friend, Mr. Guan Yongchun.

163
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,580
I just didn't expect

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,710
my friend's daughter

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,190
to be so clever and smart

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,510
and beautiful.

167
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,050
Moreover,

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,930
she has a connection with my son,

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,510
Song Pai.

170
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

171
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,630
I will cherish this bond.

172
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,390
Your Majesty.

173
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,590
As the First Princess,

174
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,500
I cannot casually let a Chinese woman...

175
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,410
Enough.

176
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,440
China is developing rapidly.

177
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,750
It is a beautiful

178
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,350
and strong country.

179
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,310
There are many

180
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,330
things we can learn from and emulate.

181
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,710
Having a Chinese Princess

182
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,550
is our honor.

183
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,190
I hereby announce

184
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,200
that both princess

185
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,670
have my full approval.

186
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,760
Pai.

187
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,810
Ge.

188
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,340
You may

189
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,110
choose a date for your weddings.

190
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,950
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

191
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,030
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,470
The First Prince of Manbo Kingdom

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,110
even randomly picked

194
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,630
a woman of unknown identity
to compete for the heir.

195
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,590
That's your sister-in-law.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,670
Hmph.

197
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,390
A foreign merchant's daughter

198
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,790
is not worthy of our Manbo royal family.

199
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,310
Second Prince, don't be angry.

200
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,230
Don't blame the First Prince.

201
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,680
It's my fault.

202
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,350
What are you doing?

203
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,870
This is an ancient Chinese tradition.

204
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,140
When people's energies don't align,

205
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,460
- we need to cleanse it.
- Pai.

206
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,430
She's too suspicious.

207
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,590
Shh.

208
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,230
Lin Ge.

209
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,870
I've seen

210
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,390
this mysterious power in China.

211
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,260
You better be sincere.

212
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,590
She can even perform rituals.

213
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,110
Pai.

214
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,030
You're completely bewitched by her.

215
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,040
If I could perform rituals,

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,860
I wouldn't let someone
who harms their siblings live.

217
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,780
Three days ago,

218
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,870
someone ordered the pursuit
of the First Prince.

219
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,870
Luckily, the First Prince is skilled

220
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,350
and escaped safely.

221
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,430
My engagement with Wen Shanna

222
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,640
is set in stone.

223
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,570
I will not yield

224
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,110
in the succession battle.

225
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,350
You.

226
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,970
You're called Guan Mengmeng, right?

227
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,650
I won't believe you.

228
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,380
This is bad.

229
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,230
Pai.

230
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,310
They don't believe our love at all.

231
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,430
Lin Ge.

232
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,630
Grow up quickly.

233
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,750
Stop being provoked

234
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,950
by those schemers.

235
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,830
Let's go, Mengmeng.

236
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,990
After planning this action for so long,

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,230
you ruined it.

238
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,030
He even brought back a woman.

239
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,510
Sorry.

240
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
It's my mistake.

241
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,310
Many people have switched sides
to support Song Pai.

242
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,170
If he becomes Crown Prince,

243
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,230
our good days

244
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,510
will be over.

245
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,460
I think there's something suspicious
about Guan Mengmeng.

246
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,390
We still have a chance

247
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,030
to defeat Song Pai.

248
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,100
Only seven days until the wedding.

249
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,730
This woman

250
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,030
must disappear.

251
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,390
Yes.

252
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,580
The wedding?

253
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,210
Next week.

254
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,330
What? Next week?

255
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,950
No.

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,350
I haven't prepared anything.

257
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,830
I'll help you get ready.

258
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,490
You don't need to worry about anything.

259
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,680
Just wait

260
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,110
and be a beautiful bride.

261
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,750
It's not that simple.

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,480
You think being a bride is that easy?

263
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,990
Think about your recovered company

264
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,020
and your upcoming reward.

265
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,230
And also all the resources
you might control

266
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,670
after becoming the First Princess.

267
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,910
Doesn't that make you less afraid?

268
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,470
This marriage

269
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,590
must happen.

270
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,230
It's possible.

Get up for etiquette training.
