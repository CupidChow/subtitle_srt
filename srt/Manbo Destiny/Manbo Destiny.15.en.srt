=Episode 15=

3
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:38,015
Lin Ge,

4
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:40,092
why did you bring me here?

5
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:07,131
- I…
- I…

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,300
- You go first.
- You go first.

7
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:10,669
You first.

8
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:31,554
Lately, I've come to realize

9
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:35,785
that I really like you.

10
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:43,169
I've never felt this way before.

11
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,131
Do…

12
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,823
Do you feel the same way?

13
00:01:59,054 --> 00:01:59,900
I understand.

14
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,092
Lin Ge,

15
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:31,438
at first I really was using you.

16
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:34,323
But now I know
I can't lie to myself anymore.

17
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:35,554
I like you, Lin Ge.

18
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:37,900
Say that again.

19
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:40,246
I like you.

20
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,523
Mengmeng,

21
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,638
the e-commerce summit is about to start.

22
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:23,023
Are you going or not?

23
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,946
I'm anxious too.

24
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:30,177
But if I go alone,
I can't represent Manbo.

25
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,061
It would only be a personal appearance.

26
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:34,908
Right now,

27
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:36,869
the priority is to get Song Pai

28
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:40,061
to attend the summit
to facilitate bilateral trade.

29
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,292
I know.

30
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,138
But Song Pai isn't exactly…

31
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,638
Qi, I'll contact you.

32
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,023
Mengmeng.

33
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,869
Call me anytime if you need anything.

34
00:03:58,715 --> 00:03:59,292
Mengmeng,

35
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,985
I stand with you.

36
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:02,331
I'll always have your back.

37
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:14,369
Song Pai.

38
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,715
Where are you going?

39
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,869
I don't need to tell you
where I'm going, An Man.

40
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,138
Song Pai!

41
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:27,138
It doesn't matter
whether you remember who I am.

42
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:29,061
What matters is that you remember
who you are,

43
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,946
and why you came here.

44
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,100
Song Pai,

45
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,754
you have to attend
the international e-commerce summit

46
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,331
in Xishuangbanna

47
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,138
and push forward China-Manbo trade.

48
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:43,023
That's how we can raise funds
for the disaster victims.

49
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:44,908
This is your duty, Song Pai.

50
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:51,138
I…

51
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,908
I think I remember
what I'm supposed to do.

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,677
You're supposed
to raise funds for the victims.

53
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,023
But the details…

54
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,946
I really can't recall.

55
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,869
You're supposed to promote
e-commerce trade

56
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,715
and raise money for the victims.

57
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,138
You…

58
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:12,754
What's wrong?

59
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:14,254
My head hurts…

60
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,023
Okay, okay. Stop thinking about it.

61
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,660
You don't have
to think about it anymore.

62
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:19,292
Clear your mind…

63
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:20,523
What are you two doing?

64
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,023
Are you all right?

65
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,100
I'm glad you're okay.

66
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:51,061
Pai, didn't we say we'd visit

67
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:52,369
the Dai Ethnic Park together?

68
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:54,369
Let's go.

69
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:55,792
It'll be dark soon

70
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,446
and the scenery won't be as nice.

71
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:08,369
Fine.

72
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,946
If you're choosing to stay,

73
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:14,215
then I'll go by myself.

74
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:37,408
Pai!

75
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:41,677
What's wrong?

76
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,792
Are you feeling unwell?

77
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:46,831
Are you okay?

78
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:56,138
I'm fine.

79
00:06:58,869 --> 00:06:59,715
Let's go.

80
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,208
Mengmeng, are you sure
you can handle it by yourself?

81
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:11,400
Sigh.

82
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,590
I can't believe Song Pai
would bail on you last minute.

83
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:16,861
At this point,

84
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,554
what's the use of complaining?

85
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,592
Even if Song Pai
never regains his memory,

86
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:24,246
I still have to attend
the e-commerce summit.

87
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,554
Wasn't this our childhood promise?

88
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,746
You still remember?

89
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,400
Back when we were at the orphanage,

90
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,870
we often saw villagers' crops

91
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,823
rot in the fields
because they couldn't be sold.

92
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,361
It broke your heart every time.

93
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:38,092
Now things are different.

94
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:41,015
I use e-commerce, and you help promote
agricultural products.

95
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,477
We can sell Xishuangbanna products
from China

96
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:44,746
to Manbo,

97
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,554
and Manbo products

98
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:47,592
to China.

99
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,669
And eventually, to the whole world.

100
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,400
That's how rural revitalization

101
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:52,631
and shared prosperity

102
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:53,746
happen.

103
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,054
My, oh, my.

104
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:55,800
That's my Mengmeng.

105
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:57,554
How did I never notice before?

106
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,000
With that kind of vision,
your value just shot through the roof.

107
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:01,554
Amazing.

108
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,515
That's the spirit.

109
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,246
Let's do it.

110
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:03,977
All in!

111
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:05,030
Let's do this!

112
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,823
All in!

113
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,420
(Xishuangbanna Thumb Corn)

114
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,940
(China's white tea
enters its Yunnan era)

115
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,708
Welcome to Mengmeng's livestream.

116
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:17,015
We're here in beautiful Xishuangbanna,

117
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:18,323

118
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,326
(Guan Mengmeng)
attending the International Cross Border

119
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,592
E-Commerce Expo.

120
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,631
This whole place is our livestream.

121
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:26,990
You can see everyone going live.

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
Take a look
at our Xishuangbanna thumb corn.

123
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:29,500
Soft, sticky, and sweet.

124
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,669
No additives whatsoever.

125
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:31,977
Vacuum sealed to lock in freshness.

126
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,020
(Looks delicious.)

127
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,323
Hey little girl, you're buying corn too?

128
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:46,861
Yes.

129
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,285
You're so cute!

130
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:49,669
Look at the camera.

131
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,169
Look here. Let's take a photo.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,469
The tea we're brewing right now

133
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,431
is a raw Pu'er tea.

134
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:02,854
This raw tea is called

135
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,431
Tianmen Mountain.

136
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,623
With red wine, it's vineyards.

137
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:08,123
With Pu'er, it's mountains.

138
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,162
Three million viewers.

139
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:14,662
Take a look at the color of the tea.

140
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,546
A bright, golden liquid.

141
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:22,969
This is

142
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,777
ripe Pu'er tea.

143
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,777
A deep, rich, translucent red
is the mark

144
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,200
of a good ripe tea.

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,162
Seven million!

146
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:31,008
My goodness!

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,046
Qi,

148
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:32,700
this is amazing!

149
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:35,200
You're amazing!

150
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,815
I see everyone's
very interested in Pu'er tea.

151
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:54,392
This is for rinsing the tea.

152
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:56,623
Yes, this is the rinse.

153
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:58,008
We'll drink it in a bit.

154
00:09:58,354 --> 00:09:59,469
Smell the aroma.

155
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,008
Smell the tea.

156
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,354
Isn't it fragrant?

157
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:09,392
Do you catch
a hint of wild mountain flowers?

158
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,246
Ten million.

159
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,400
Heavens!

160
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,336
Come on. Take a look at this.

161
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:35,682
The special edition BFO "Tipsy" perfume.

162
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,182
Wow, there are so many people.

163
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,106
This is my absolute favorite perfume.

164
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,375
I wear it every day.

165
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,144
We're covered head to toe

166
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:43,721
in this scent.

167
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:45,336
Hello!

168
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,259
Ladies,

169
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,106
what are you doing?

170
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,336
I'm pouring the wine.

171
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,759
Look at her pearl earrings,

172
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,336
pearl necklace, and that red dress.

173
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,529
Put together like this,

174
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,106
you can tell this wine

175
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,490
is something special.

176
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,990
You're beautiful.

177
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,529
Thank you.

178
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,221
Please try our wine.

179
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:02,259
Thank you.

180
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,144
Let's give it a taste.

181
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:06,221
Oh, this aroma…

182
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:09,567
You can smell coffee and fruit notes.

183
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,836
We're at Spring River Bright Moon,
Green City in Xishuangbanna.

184
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:15,529
Stop by if you have time.

185
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:16,952
Come try our wine at our winery.

186
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,875
Oh, shoot! We've got haters!

187
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,413
What's wrong?

188
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:24,667
(Livestream policy violation)

190
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:26,336
What?

191
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,772
(Why?)

192
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:55,310
(Why does my heart hurt so much?)

193
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:58,387
I refuse.

194
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,387
I'm Guan Mengmeng,
your Chinese daughter-in-law.

195
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:04,657
The one and only Guan Mengmeng.

196
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:15,964
Song Pai!

197
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,541
What's wrong?

198
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:21,310
(Why does my heart ache
when I see you?)

199
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:24,272
Song Pai!

200
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:25,195
What's gotten into you?

201
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:28,887
Song Pai?

202
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,233
Song Pai!

203
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:35,887
Song Pai,

204
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:36,733
don't scare me!

205
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:37,887
Song Pai!

206
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:40,310
Wake up, Song Pai!

207
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,137
Mengmeng…

208
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:58,560
Don't go…

209
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:22,407
Why?

210
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,522
You can't even recognize me,

211
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,022
yet you still treat me
with such affection.

212
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,060
Song Pai.

213
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,368
Mengmeng…

214
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,714
What should I do?

215
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,660
♪I do this for you♪

216
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,300
