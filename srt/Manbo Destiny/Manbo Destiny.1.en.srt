00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,130
=Episode 1=

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,900
(According to legend,)

3
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,550
(300 years ago,)

4
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,860
(King Lan Yue of the Manbo Kingdom)

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,910
(marrying Princess Guan Xinrui
of Mengzhen Kingdom.)

6
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,130
(King Lan Yue)
(The whole nation celebrates.)

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,250
(On the wedding night,)

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,130
(everything changed suddenly.)

9
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,670
(A joyous event)

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,100
(turned into a disaster.)

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,030
(Marriage-alliance princess,
Guan Xinrui)

12
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,330
(Two souls originally worlds apart)

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,080
(were bound together
by a fateful marriage,)

14
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,750
(by the red thread of destiny.)

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,330
Let me go!

16
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,630
My queen, you can't escape.

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,170
Let me go!

18
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,250
What's wrong with you?

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,370
Guan Xinrui, do you hate me that much?

20
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,790
Lan Yue.

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,120
You will never

22
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,480
have me in all your lives.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,060
Guan Xinrui.

24
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,230
(Through the layers of time and fog,)

25
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,170
(the red thread of fate)

26
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,630
(tightly binds two different souls
once again.)

27
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,060
=Manbo Destiny=

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,950
(Three hundred years later)

29
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,940
(I am Guan Mengmeng,)

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,250
(grew up in an orphanage.)

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,830
(Little thumb corn)
(I used to work in e-commerce)

32
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,790
(from Xishuangbanna)
(in Xishuangbanna.)

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,550
(Five years ago,)

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,940
(I discovered huge
business opportunities overseas.)

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,480
(So my boyfriend Zhong Cheng and I)

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,870
(Xishuangbanna, Yunnan)
(came to this small country located)

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,400
(Manbo Kingdom)
(on the Pacific Ocean,)

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,370
(Manbo Kingdom.)

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,630
(We began our joint venture.)

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,480
(Over the years,)

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,330
(I worked day and night.)

42
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,670
(The business thrived.)

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,440
(I was about to reach the pinnacle
of my life.)

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,100
(I thought I would be a winner in life.)

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,060
Zhong Cheng.

46
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,100
(Zhong Cheng & An Man)
(I never expected)

47
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,900
(Zhong Cheng & An Man)
(I would become a joke in life.)

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,330
(My boyfriend married my best friend.)

49
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,930
You rascal!

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Welcome everyone

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,250
(Zhong Cheng & An Man)
to the wedding of me and Man.

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,210
Guan Mengmeng has agreed

53
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,020
to transfer the entire company

54
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,830
to me.

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,870
(They even took away my company.)

56
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,330
I will give the company

57
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,370
as a bride price

58
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,870
to Man.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,670
An Man.

60
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,500
I treated you as a best friend

61
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,100
and you treat me like this.

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,170
Mengmeng.

63
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,400
Let me explain.

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,870
It's my fault

65
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,900
for being too charming.

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,830
If you were without me,

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,630
you could still live well.

68
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,370
Carefree.

69
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,480
But if Man

70
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,900
without me,

71
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,100
she wouldn't survive.

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Sorry, Mengmeng.

73
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,750
Right now.

74
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,020
Your man

75
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,710
and your company

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,710
are all mine.

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,790
Gun! Run! Hurry, run!

78
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,500
Where is everyone?

79
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:36,600
Don't move!

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,330
Boss.

81
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,170
Mengmeng.

82
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,110
Don't shoot.

83
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,170
Mengmeng.

84
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,210
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,520
Don't blame me.

86
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,400
If you blame,

87
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,790
blame her.

88
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,370
She seduced me.

89
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:51,750
Mengmeng.

90
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,100
Zhong Cheng.

91
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:53,710
You...

92
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,370
Mengmeng.

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,150
I return Zhong Cheng to you.

94
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,100
I am not a trash can.

95
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,470
I return the company to you.

96
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,580
Please.

97
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,560
Don't shoot.

98
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,940
Don't.

99
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,480
Get on quickly.

100
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,870
Get on quickly.

101
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,300
Don't move!

102
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,100
Mengmeng.

103
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,290
Put the gun down.

104
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,940
Calm down.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,150
Let's see who dares to move!

106
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,280
For the sake of our

107
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
five years together,

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,870
please don't shoot, okay?

109
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,210
I give you.

110
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,400
Mengmeng.

111
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,330
It's water, you dare mess with me!

112
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,790
Boss, are you okay?

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,440
Hurry, go after them!

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,180
The legal documents
and company approvals are all inside.

115
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,100
(I am Song Pai, the Fisrt Prince
of the Manbo Kingdom.)

116
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,630
(I studied politics and economics
in China)

117
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,290
(for three years.)

118
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,350
(All to fulfill my childhood dream)

119
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,900
(of becoming a wise leader of Manbo,)

120
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,400
(to lead my people to prosperity.)

121
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,330
(Now,)

122
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,870
(one step away from my goal.)

123
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,440
(Only a wedding remains.)

124
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,750
Good morning,

125
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,370
everyone.

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,170
Welcome to Manbo News.

127
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,940
Latest news, the king has decreed
that any prince who fulfills

128
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,700
(Manbo News)
the three conditions of marriage,

129
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,710
(Manbo News)
career,

130
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,060
(Manbo News)
and winning the people's hearts

131
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,170
may become the heir.

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,170
Currently,

133
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,250
the First Prince Song Pai

134
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,940
about to marry Princess Wen Shanna

135
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,130
is the only prince
who meets the conditions.

136
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,920
The whole nation eagerly
awaits their grand wedding.

137
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,750
I tell you.

138
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,250
I support the First Prince.

139
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,870
He studied abroad for many years

140
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,870
and is well-traveled.

141
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,710
That's incorrect.

142
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,560
The First Prince is weak and sickly.

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,630
He won't live long.

144
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,230
I believe the throne rightfully belongs
to the second prince, Lin Ge.

145
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,580
Mercy, Your Highness!

146
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,290
Take him away.

147
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,520
I won't dare again.

148
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,870
Mercy, Your Highness!

149
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,060
Continue.

150
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,440
Welcome the First Prince
back to the country.

151
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,400
Welcome the First Prince
back to the country.

152
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,520
Your Highness.

153
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,870
The First Princess is missing.

154
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,630
(Wen Shanna, this unreliable woman.)

155
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,900
(Disappears at the crucial moment.)

156
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,250
(I'll dig three feet underground
if I have to, to marry her.)

157
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,250
We must find Wen Shanna quickly.

158
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,480
You go search her house.

159
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,330
Okay.

160
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Where are she? Check over there!

161
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,130
Don't let her escape!

162
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,850
Here she is!

163
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,760
(Second Prince, Lin Ge)

164
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,770
(Wen Shanna)

165
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,630
Sorry.

166
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,280
Pai.

167
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,740
I stole your Princess.

168
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,400
(Song Pai, let's see what you do now?)

169
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,310
This is what you wanted?

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,740
Your Highness.

171
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,350
Don't blame Lin Ge.

172
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,770
Blame me instead.

173
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,810
What wrong have you done?

174
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,450
The one not loved

175
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,860
is the one at fault.

176
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,850
I know.

177
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,030
You've looked down on me
since childhood.

178
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,720
But

179
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,750
I still took your fiancée.

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,310
Without the Princess,

181
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,860
I want your position

182
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,070
as heir too.

183
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,050
As long as I'm here,

184
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,800
you won't succeed.

185
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,420
Then cease to exist.

186
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,970
My dear

187
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,160
brother.

188
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,040
Go.

189
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,970
Get out of the way! Move!

190
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,530
Be careful!

191
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,930
Get in the carmotorcycle quickly.

192
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,740
Chase them, don't let them escape!

193
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,760
The motorcycle is here,
they must be nearby.

194
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,630
Where did they go?

195
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,710
You two.

196
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,280
Over there.

197
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,020
You two.

198
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,530
Come with me.

199
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,580
You want to run even if dead?

200
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,170
Get up!

201
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,880
So eager to escape, huh?

202
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,440
With blood as an offering,

203
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,630
I will be with you

204
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,590
forever.

205
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,630
What are you doing?

206
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,630
What happened to me just now?

207
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,670
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,050
You attend the wedding.

209
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,750
I attend the funeral.

210
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,590
She's here!

211
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,480
Don't be afraid.

212
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,880
Hand over the items!

213
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,760
If not, don't blame me.

214
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,550
Brothers!

215
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,050
Attack!

216
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:13,940
Go.

217
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,920
Take them down.

218
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,130
Ah!

219
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,820
- Stop fighting! Mercy!
- Stop fighting! Mercy!

220
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,090
Your Highness.

221
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,960
I am late, please forgive me.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
First Prince?

223
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,670
(He is the First Prince, then I...)

224
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,090
What's wrong with you?

225
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,630
My queen.

226
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,370
We will never be apart.

227
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,670
(Regarding love,
we have seen too many stories.)

228
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,360
(But what is the true meaning of love?)

229
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,440
(Many are still searching for it.)
