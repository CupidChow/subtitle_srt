3
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,569
One hundred and fifty million.

4
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:32,223
This deal

5
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:33,723
must not be closed by Song Pai.

6
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:36,377
Do you have a plan?

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,915
Mother, take a look at this.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,492
All the signed photos
of the First Prince are gone.

9
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:47,030
There will be even bigger surprises
next livestream.

10
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:48,607
What are you implying?

11
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:51,877
If something happens
to the First Princess,

12
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:55,530
do you think the First Prince
can still focus on business?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,539
BFO Tipsy Series Valentine's
Everlasting Love Gift Set.

14
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,385
It comes in a Prince Edition
and a Princess Edition.

15
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:11,077
The Prince Edition features...

16
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:15,462
A woody, spicy fragrance.

17
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,885
What are you doing?

18
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey.

19
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:30,346
What is that?

20
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,616
This belonged to the late Queen.

21
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:37,923
It has been kept
in the First Prince's private vault.

22
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:43,616
The First Princess
stole an heirloom of the late Queen.

23
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:45,808
Take her away.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,654
Move.

25
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,846
Over there.

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,085
Mr. Li, thank you for sharing so much
technical support with us,

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
and for trusting us
with such a major contract.

28
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,777
You are too kind, Your Highness.

29
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:03,662
I look forward
to your continued guidance.

30
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:04,546
Certainly.

31
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,431
Very well.

32
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:06,600
Then I will take my leave.

33
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:08,046
Of course. Safe travels.

34
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:09,623
Goodbye.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,123
Boss, something has gone wrong.

36
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:17,290
The Queen sent people to disrupt
the First Princess's livestream.

37
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:22,815
Seize her.

38
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,162
This way.

39
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:34,739
Nobody move.

40
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,585
You are framing me.

41
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,046
I did not take anything.

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,969
It is perfume.

43
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:52,815
Take her.

44
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:56,162
Over here.

45
00:02:58,815 --> 00:02:59,700
You lunatic.

46
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,340
Let go of me.

47
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:07,008
Guan Mengmeng.

48
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:08,854
Looks like today finally came.

49
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,354
You finally made it.

50
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:21,190
Rui, I have missed you terribly.

51
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:24,162
Where is Lan Yue?

52
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,085
Lan Yue?

53
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,354
He went to meet the general.

54
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,892
What happens between us

55
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:34,354
must never reach His Majesty.

56
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:36,090
Wen was a gifted scholar

57
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,315
who grew up alongside Guan Xinrui.

58
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:39,739
They loved each other deeply

59
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,046
and were meant to marry.

60
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:44,162
But to secure
an alliance with Manbo Kingdom,

61
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,508
the Emperor chose Guan Xinrui

62
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:49,662
as a political bride,
separating the lovers.

63
00:03:58,777 --> 00:03:59,354
Mengmeng.

64
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:00,585
Mengmeng.

65
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:02,431
Wake up, Mengmeng.

66
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,354
Wake up.

67
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:07,162
Mengmeng.

68
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:08,623
Wake up.

69
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:18,969
Stop it.

70
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:23,546
Is that you, Mengmeng?

71
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,777
Wen, did you not say you missed me?

72
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:33,585
Rui.

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,008
My Rui.

74
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:36,585
Enough.

75
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:38,123
Who are you?

76
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:46,623
(What just happened?)

77
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:48,777
(It felt as if time froze.)

78
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,392
(Song Pai?)

79
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:54,777
Let her go.

80
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:56,892
Release her.

81
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:00,162
Rui.

82
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,008
Have you lost your senses?

83
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:04,931
Rui?

84
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:07,892
She is my wife, Guan Mengmeng.

85
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:12,162
Second Princess.

86
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:13,931
Second Princess.

87
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:17,123
The Queen is waiting.

88
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:20,123
May I ask,

89
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:22,546
why my wife has been detained?

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,380
The First Princess is suspected
of stealing royal property.

91
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,739
By order of the Queen,
she is to be held for investigation.

92
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,700
You old witch.

93
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,123
Those items were for my livestream.

94
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,585
You have no right to call it theft.

95
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:33,392
Mengmeng.

96
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:35,200
Your Highness.

97
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,730
You cannot shield her
simply because she is your wife.

98
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,354
Theft is not something to take lightly.

99
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,392
Am I asking you?

100
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,354
We were mistaken.

101
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:49,162
Second Princess.

102
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:52,700
Do not look.

103
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:56,546
Leave now.

104
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,157
(In that illusion,)

105
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,850
(the version of me and the woman
who looks like Guan Mengmeng)

106
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,965
(what is the connection between us?)

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,888
Nana.

108
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:34,926
Nana.

109
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,426
Are you alright?

110
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:39,157
What happened?

111
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:42,349
Second Prince,

112
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:44,195
please remember who you are.

113
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,080
Mother really went too far.

114
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,426
Mother is always punishing you like this.

115
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,370
What are you doing?

116
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:54,965
Sit down.

117
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:55,772
Let go.

118
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:56,349
Sit down.

119
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,272
Second Prince.

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,734
If you have nothing better to do...

121
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:05,234
Do not move.

122
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:09,542
Does it hurt?

123
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:13,311
(If Lin Ge put this much effort)

124
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,811
(into fighting for power,
it would be so much better.)

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,208
(Still,)

126
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,938
(he truly is a gentle man.)

127
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,738
Is it done?

128
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:29,777
Yes.

129
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:38,777
By the way,

130
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,162
we have raised one hundred
and twenty million.

131
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:42,777
One hundred and twenty million?

132
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,085
Really?

133
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,623
That puts us just a bit
behind my brother.

134
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,008
We will reach five hundred million soon.

135
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:55,123
I promised you.

136
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,585
I will make sure you win.

137
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:57,815
I mean it.

138
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,508
Nana, you really are impressive.

139
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,469
What is going on?

140
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,150
Why is it happening again so fast?

141
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:23,969
I need to see a doctor.

142
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:09,546
Move in.

143
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:20,815
(This necklace…)

144
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:22,390
(If it stays, it will only bring trouble.)

145
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,508
(It has to be destroyed.)

146
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,508
Ah!

147
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:36,546
Song Pai.

148
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:37,123
Mengmeng.

149
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,046
What are you doing in here?

150
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:40,969
Listen to me.

151
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:41,200
I…

152
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:43,123
You were in the shower for so long,

153
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,580
I got worried something had happened.

154
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:46,931
You creep.

155
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,123
Mengmeng, let me explain.

156
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:51,931
Ah!

157
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,392
Close your eyes.

158
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,431
I am sorry, Mengmeng.

159
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,354
Close your eyes.

160
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:58,085
I swear I did not see anything.

161
00:09:59,008 --> 00:09:59,623
Do not look.

162
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,815
I really did not see anything.

163
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:01,354
Eyes closed.

164
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:03,046
I swear, Mengmeng.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,392
I told you to close your eyes.

166
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:05,623
They are closed.

167
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,469
Keep them closed.

168
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:08,392
Do not open them.

169
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,431
Are you done yet?

170
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:12,854
Song Pai.

171
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:24,931
You can clearly see everything.

172
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:25,623
I…

173
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,085
You jerk!

174
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:47,354
Guan Mengmeng.

175
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,315
You are still the same girl

176
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,277
I fell for at first sight.

177
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:55,931
Thank you.

178
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:57,623
Thank you for coming today,

179
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,123
even after everything.

180
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:04,990
I thought you hated me by now,
and never wanted to see me again.

181
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
We did share something real once.

182
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,008
If you asked to see me,

183
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,354
how could I not come?

184
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:16,315
Are you not afraid

185
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:17,931
your First Prince

186
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:19,508
will be angry?

187
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,508
I was more afraid you would be hurt.

188
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:24,738
I knew you still cared about me.

189
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:25,277
Let us

190
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:27,315
share a drink together.

191
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:28,738
Let bygones

192
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,585
be bygones.

193
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:35,508
