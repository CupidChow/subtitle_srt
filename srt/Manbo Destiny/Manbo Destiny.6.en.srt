=Episode 6=

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,630
Will you release him

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,950
if I become yours?

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,950
Of course.

6
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,050
I never lie to you.

7
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,470
Mengmeng, are you all right?

8
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,630
Mengmeng.

9
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,070
What's wrong?

10
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,750
Have I met you

11
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,220
a long time ago?

12
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,430
Why do I

13
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,360
feel an unexplainable fear

14
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,860
whenever I see you?

15
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,430
I guess you had a nightmare.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,070
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

17
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,190
Don't be afraid.

18
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,830
Go and sleep on the bed.

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,990
Will you release him

20
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,710
if I become yours?

21
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,790
Of course.

22
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,250
Mengmeng, what's wrong?

23
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,070
Tonight...

24
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,430
Mengmeng.

25
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,110
I'm yours.

26
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,120
Mengmeng, what's wrong with you?

27
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,310
Wait.

28
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,230
Wait.

29
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,220
Guan Mengmeng.

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,190
Guan Mengmeng, don't be reckless.

31
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,710
Mengmeng.

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,190
Your Majesty, forgive us!

33
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,390
I beg you.

34
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,470
I beg you to let them go.

35
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,270
They are the people closest to me.

36
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,520
Hmph.

37
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,180
The closest people to you?

38
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,110
They can't even take good care of you.

39
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,910
How are they closest to you?

40
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,500
No.

41
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,940
No.

42
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,430
Someone!

43
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,510
Take them away

44
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,950
- and imprison them for life!
- Yes!

45
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,270
Your Majesty, spare us!

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,310
I beg you to let them go.

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,870
You want me?

48
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,090
I'll give myself to you.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,550
I'll give myself to you.

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,190
Don't you want me?

51
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,350
Now is the time.

52
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Wait, Mengmeng.

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,270
Mengmeng, wait.

54
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,260
Wait.

55
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,610
Mengmeng, wake up!

56
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,810
Mengmeng.

57
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,430
Mengmeng!

58
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,070
Mengmeng, wake up!

59
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,750
Mengmeng!

60
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,910
Mengmeng.

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,670
Sorry.

62
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,030
Was that really me just now?

63
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,230
I treated you so cruelly?

64
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,060
We are finally married.

65
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,630
Second Prince,

66
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,590
there's no need to be so serious.

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,770
We're married in name only.

68
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,710
What do you mean?

69
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,510
I don't love you.

70
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,870
But...

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,090
You said you needed me

72
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,720
and begged me to marry you.

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,770
Yes.

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,750
I do need you.

75
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,920
Don't you need me as well?

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,510
Without me,

77
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,200
how can you compete with Song Pai
for the position of crown prince?

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,310
So, you've only wanted to use me.

79
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,270
No.

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,990
You want to win against Song Pai

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,190
and I want to become the crown princess.

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,590
I'm not using you.

83
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,970
We are just using each other

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,950
and getting what we need.

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,590
Wen Shanna!

86
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,350
I'll tell you honestly.

87
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,160
I only agreed to marry you

88
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,750
because I pitied you.

89
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
I have a soft spot for women.

90
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,790
Second Prince.

91
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,960
I don't care why you pity me.

92
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,240
I also don't care why you married me.

93
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,240
But as long as I'm around,

94
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,790
you will surely be the crown prince

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,150
because I will

96
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,030
surely become the queen.

97
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,310
For your family

98
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,070
and your father,

99
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,470
do you think it's worth it

100
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,030
for you to do this?

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,670
Sacrificing me alone

102
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,710
for my family's prosperity.

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,510
It's a good deal

104
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,670
for me.

105
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,120
A good deal?

106
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,550
It's a good deal for other people.

107
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,020
You should know
my brother's capabilities

108
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,650
better than me.

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,590
With the nutty Guan Mengmeng
by his side,

110
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,460
your possibility
of becoming queen is minimal.

111
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,070
That only means

112
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,150
you

113
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:41,930
are

114
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,250
bad.

115
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:43,970
You...

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,710
Will you be happy

117
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,060
after becoming the queen?

118
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,260
Mengmeng, wake up.

119
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,450
Mengmeng.

120
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,310
(Seriously.
Is this real or is it a dream?)

121
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,790
Mengmeng.

122
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,830
(He's so calm. Was that just a dream?)

123
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,860
What's wrong?

124
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,110
What is this?

125
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,270
Take a look first.

126
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,950
The e-commerce approval?

127
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,350
You got it done so quickly?

128
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,290
Since the contract has been signed,

129
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,060
I'll surely obey it.

130
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,310
Then, what about my reward
for attending the wedding,

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,350
one million Manbo Coins?

132
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,230
Attend the wedding?

133
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,070
That's your own wedding.

134
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,090
I don't care.

135
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,310
I was

136
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,470
a performance guest.

137
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,660
(Transfer to Guan Mengmeng 1,500,000)

138
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,020
(Transfer Guan Mengmeng)

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,070
1.5 million?

140
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,550
Didn't you say it was a million?

141
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,870
The extra 500 thousand coins

142
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,850
was compensation

143
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,550
for last night.

144
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,350
(Gosh, it wasn't a dream.)

145
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,400
You might be the one to act first,

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,990
but I'm not someone
who takes advantage of people.

147
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,270
Yes.

148
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,750
I did act first.

149
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,950
So, I should compensate you

150
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,150
instead of you compensating me.

151
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,380
(Transfer to Song Pai 500,000)

152
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,290
500 thousand coins.

153
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,670
I've transferred it to you.

154
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,110
No.

155
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,850
I'll reject it.

156
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,950
Stop.

157
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,220
In that case,

158
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,520
we'll compromise.

159
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,630
Since we don't think
any of us are at a loss,

160
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,710
why don't we

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,390
think of it as an accident?

162
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
Yes.

163
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,690
That was an accident.

164
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,450
Sure.

165
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,430
I'll listen to you.

166
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,110
But I don't want your money.

167
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,340
In that case,

168
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,790
donate it.

169
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,630
Think of it as the disaster relief fund.

170
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,400
What do you think?

171
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,550
I'll listen to you.

172
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,800
Mengmeng.

173
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,190
Later,

174
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,750
I'm bringing you out.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,670
You should dress up.

176
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,190
Going out again?

177
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,630
Why do royalties
have so many things to do?

178
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,150
One hour.

179
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,390
If you're late by a second,
your money will be deducted.

180
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,910
What a stingy prince.

181
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,730
When I take all your money,
I'll leave this place immediately.

182
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,230
(Leave?)

183
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,790
(Dream on.)

184
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,210
(Hmph.)

185
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,580
(Welcome Back Home)

186
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,270
Don't open your eyes.

187
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,250
Tada!

188
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,950
(Welcome Back Home)

189
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,320
Why are all of you here?

190
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,110
Do you want a company without a team?

191
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,470
I bought this building.

192
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,190
From today onwards,

193
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,270
this will be your permanent office.

194

Thank you, all of you.

196
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,070
Did you

197
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,140
do

198
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,310
all these?

199
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,630
Did you bring all my friends here?

200
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,390
Of course.

201
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,860
This is the surprise
our boss prepared for you.

202
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,710
Our boss...

203
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,670
Enough.

204
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,960
Are you satisfied?

207
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,230
Everyone, thank you

We should thank you instead.

211
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,830
You still remember us
even after becoming the princess.

212
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,910
Am I right?

213
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,310

It's too early to be happy.

217
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,030
Look at this first.

218
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,670
What is this?

219
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,350
These are the projects
you developed in the past.

220
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,190
And your former clients as well.

221
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,350
I contacted all of them.

222
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,120
They are willing

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,110
