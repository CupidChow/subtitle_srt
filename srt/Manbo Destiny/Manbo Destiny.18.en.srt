3
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,054
Zhong Cheng.

4
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:43,054
Song Pai.

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,785
Zhong Cheng, what are you doing?

6
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:46,669
Why is it you?

7
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:48,640
You're finally awake.

8
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:51,986
- Lin Ge.
- Lin Ge.

9
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:52,486
Wen Shanna.

10
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:53,332
Wake up.

11
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:57,678
Who are you?

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,390
We dare to kidnap anyone.

13
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:00,294
Zhong Cheng.

14
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:03,448
Let us go!

15
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,755
Shut up, all of you.

16
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:08,525
You're in my hands now.

17
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,332
Don't waste my time.

18
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:11,853
So,

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,951
you were the one
who reported that livestream.

20
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,605
You were behind it, Zhong Cheng.

21
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,220
As expected of my clever ex-girlfriend.

22
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,182
Your Royal Highness, the First Prince.

23
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:30,759
Hello.

24
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:33,605
So proud as you are,

25
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:36,759
did you ever expect

26
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:39,451
to fall into my hands one day?

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,759
Let us go, Zhong Cheng.

28
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:50,490
The noble Second Princess,

29
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:52,567
did you expect

30
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:55,067
to become my plaything today?

31
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:55,759
Stop it!

32
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:58,720
You scoundrel!

33
00:01:58,913 --> 00:01:59,913
Do you know who we are?

34
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:01,759
I don't care who you are.

35
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:02,874
Are you okay?

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,682
Touch me!

37
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:04,336
Don't touch my brother!

38
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:05,220
Enough talk.

39
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:05,874
Zhong Cheng!

40
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:07,105
Zhong Cheng!

41
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,960
As expected of the First Prince.

42
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,651
Someone did send me to see you today.

43
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:24,959
Song Pai and Guan Mengmeng
disappeared in China.

44
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:29,690
Listen carefully.

45
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,305
Once people disappear,

46
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:34,997
they won't be found again.

47
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,074
Do you understand?

48
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:40,420
Understood.

49
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:42,574
Make it clean.

50
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,190
The Second Prince
and my daughter must not know.

51
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:49,459
Yes.

52
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:50,728
Yes.

53
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:19,375
That man

54
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,798
dares to kill royalty.

55
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:23,952
Let alone me.

56
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:25,875
I'm not that stupid

57
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,067
to work for him.

58
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:28,760
Instead,

59
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:30,760
we can cooperate.

60
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:33,260
As long as you agree to my terms,

61
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,337
I'll tell you

62
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:37,914
who that man is.

63
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,683
We can work together in the future.

64
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,914
What do you say?

65
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,183
Name your terms.

66
00:03:58,298 --> 00:03:59,875
My terms are simple.

67
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,914
Grant me the title of Viscount.

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,875
And,

69
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:08,914
give me start-up capital
for my business.

70
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,183
I'm not asking much.

71
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,837
One hundred million.

72
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:16,067
That's enough.

73
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:18,721
Zhong Cheng!

74
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,798
Why don't you just rob?

75
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,452
Isn't that exactly what I'm doing?

76
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,529
You all think it over carefully.

77
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,760
Think carefully.

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,644
Zhong Cheng.

79
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,183
Come back and let us go!

80
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:35,529
It's okay.

81
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:37,106
Lin Ge.

82
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:38,067
Wen Shanna.

83
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:39,106
Are you okay?

84
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,298
We're fine.

85
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,706
Help me untie this.

86
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,398
Who's there?

87
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:54,744
- An Man.
- An Man.

88
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,129
Why are you here?

89
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,513
Shh.

90
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,206
I saw Zhong Cheng earlier.

91
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,129
I felt something wrong,

92
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,321
so I followed him.

93
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,244
Hurry!

94
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,398
Wait.

95
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,821
We can't just leave like this.

96
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,052
There's no time.

97
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:25,706
Go!

98
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:27,013
I promised An Man

99
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,052
I'd teach Zhong Cheng a lesson.

100
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:28,821
This isn't the right situation.

101
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:29,283
Mengmeng.

102
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:30,090
Don't take risks.

103
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,052
I know what I'm doing.

104
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:48,475
An Man.

105
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:50,629
Why are you here?

106
00:05:53,783 --> 00:05:54,552
An Man.

107
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:56,206
I was forced into it.

108
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,821
I didn't mean to abandon you.

109
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:58,590
An Man.

110
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,206
I'll treat you well from now on,

111
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:00,860
okay?

112
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,437
I know

113
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:02,783
you'll forgive me.

114
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,552
I knew it.

115
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:07,552
Zhong Cheng

116
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,283
would never abandon me.

117
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,167
Of course.

118
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,667
My An Man is the best.

119
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:13,437
Wait here.

120
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,513
I'll deal with them first,

121
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:16,437
then come back to you.

122
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,167
So, have you decided?

123
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:28,975
We…

124
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:29,629
What are you...

125
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,667
What are you doing?

126
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,390
Don't come closer!

127
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,398
What are you doing?

128
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:33,783
Get him!

129
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,206
Don't hit me!

130
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,013
Not my face!

131
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:36,552
I was wrong!

132
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:37,360
Please stop!

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,167
Spare me!

134
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:39,590
I'll do anything!

135
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:41,437
I was wrong!

136
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:43,283
I was wrong!

137
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,013
Please!

138
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:45,552
Enough.

139
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,321
Please!

140
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:47,321
Zhong Cheng.

141
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:48,898
Aren't you so smart?

142
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,206
Let's see how you run now.

143
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:52,860
Please spare me!

144
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:54,398
I'll do anything!

145
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,475
Then tell us,

146
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,167
what use are you now?

147
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:00,013
Mengmeng,

148
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,321
don't trust him.

149
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:03,398
Let's hear him out.

150
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:04,706
Maybe

151
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,283
he's still useful.

152
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,013
If you spare me,

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,513
I'll be your informant.

154
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,052
I'll help you.

155
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,690
I'll help you deal with them.

156
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:17,783
Listen carefully.

157
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,590
If you betray us,
you won't get off so easily next time.

158
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,013
I won't. I swear.

159
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,990
I won't, Your Highness.

160
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:25,129
Lin Ge.

161
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:26,283
Come.

162
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:30,206
An Man.

163
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:30,860
Go.

164
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,860
An Man, I was wrong!

165
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,398
You won't hit me, right?

166
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,167
An Man!

167
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:38,283
Kick him.

168
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:39,513
An Man!

169
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,090
You won't hit me anymore, right?

170
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:00,513
Zhong Cheng.

171
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,975
So this day finally comes.

172
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:18,590
Pai.

173
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:22,475
This thing is ominous.

174
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:24,283
Ominous?

175
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:26,013
What do you mean?

176
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,590
Think about it.

177
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:32,090
Because of this,

178
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:34,013
my brother mistook An Man for you.

179
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:36,475
And the four of us

180
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,167
were trapped in an illusion,

181
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,437
nearly killed by Zhong Cheng.

182
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,244
Isn't that ominous?

183
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:44,052
Yes.

184
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,244
I think Lin Ge is right.

185
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,475
So,

186
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,744
everything started with this pendant.

187
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,475
Even though I believe in science,

188
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,167
this pendant really brought trouble.

189
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,629
So many problems.

190
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,629
So it really is because of it.

191
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:12,052
Mengmeng.

192
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:20,783
This way

193
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:22,513
might be the best choice.

194
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:26,629
I hope it's the right one.

195
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:29,744
This legend

196
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:30,860
is finally over.

197
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:34,621
Boss.

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,450
I'm here to pick you up.

199
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,890
Take us to the e-commerce summit first.

200
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,900
We should still make it.

201
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,544
Let's go.

202
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:44,698
I'll show you our intangible
cultural heritage in Banna.

203
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,813
Hopefully, the people of Manbo Kingdom

204
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,313
can also learn about our traditions.

205
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:55,429
Interesting, right?

206
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:58,006
Thank you all.

207
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,190
Auntie, you're amazing.

208
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,275
What material is this?

209
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:09,621
How much ?

210
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:10,583
This is bark paper.

211
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,121
Handmade pottery.

212
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:12,775
Ceramics.

213
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:15,967
What's this?

214
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:17,967
Spinning thread.

215
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,500
That's fast.

216
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,223
This time,
the e-commerce summit went well.

217
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:38,877
The funding is finally secured.

218
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:43,108
A huge weight
is finally off my shoulders.

219
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,916
It feels so good to be home.

220
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:54,839
Yeah.

221
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:57,262
It really does.

222
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,531
Why are you looking at me?

223
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,185
You finally feel this place
is your home.

224
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:08,685
Mm.

225
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,608
Anywhere you are is home to me.

226
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:14,993
Do you know?

227
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:17,839
Ever since my mother passed away,

228
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:20,685
until I met you,

229
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,916
I realized I'm no longer alone.

230
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,800
Then you should cherish it.

231
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:32,377
Understand?

232
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:36,723
I do.

233
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,031
Good.

234
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,223
I'm going to take a shower.

235
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,339
I'll join you.

236
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:51,262
Let's go.

237
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,993
Hurry up.

238
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:12,954
(If you don't want the fake marriage
exposed across Manbo,)

239
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:14,762
(come see me immediately.)

240
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,954
(The contract was burned.)

241
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,723
(Who is this)

242
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:24,454
(daring to threaten me?)

243
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:35,516
Come out.

244
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,246
Haha.

245
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,208
Saul.

246
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:44,746
What do you want?

247
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:47,170
Your Highness.

248
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,323
If you don't want the contract exposed,

249
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:54,960
issue a statement immediately
and withdraw from the succession race.

250
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Threats have their limits.

251
00:12:57,854 --> 00:12:59,354
That contract was...

252
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:01,200
Was burned by my daughter,

253
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,816
right?

254
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,393
She doesn't even know

255
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:08,162
I switched the contract long ago.

256
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,893
What you burned was a fake.

257
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,893
Song Pai,

258
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:16,700
withdraw from the succession,

259
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,816
and Guan Mengmeng will have a future.

260
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:22,585
Otherwise, her fate...

261
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,162
This has nothing to do
with Guan Mengmeng.

262
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,277
Why drag her into this?

263
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,854
What if I refuse?

264
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:33,277
Oh, how naive.

265
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:34,431
Song Pai,

266
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,277
do you really think you can protect her?

267
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:38,893
In this game of power,

268
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:42,508
a single rumor is enough to destroy her.

269
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:45,816
She'll be confined by the royal family,

270
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,008
despised by the people,

271
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,816
with no chance of redemption.

272
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,562
I'll withdraw from the succession.

273
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,523
But remember this,

274
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,485
if you lay a finger on Guan Mengmeng,

275
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,216
I will never let you go.

276
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,562
Fine.

277
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:13,831
But let me warn you,

278
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,100
don't try any tricks.

279
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:19,639
Your Highness,

280
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,216
I'll take my leave.

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,380

282
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,020
