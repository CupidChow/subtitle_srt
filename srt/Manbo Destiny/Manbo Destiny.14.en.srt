=Episode 14=

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,285
Mengmeng!

4
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:39,054
Mengmeng!

5
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,380
Mengmeng!

6
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,730
Where'd my necklace go?

7
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:18,692
Song Pai,

8
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:20,153
did you see my necklace?

9
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:21,999
Song Pai?

10
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:24,922
Song Pai?

11
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,538
Song Pai?

12
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:33,538
The First Prince of Manbo getting lost

13
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:35,615
the moment he's in Xishuangbanna.

14
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:41,499
Song Pai!

15
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,499
Song Pai!

16
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:52,538
Qi!

17
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:54,922
Did you find him?

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,902
(Qi, Childhood Friend from the Orphanage)
I came as soon as I got your call.

19
00:01:58,768 --> 00:01:59,961
He just vanished like that?

20
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:01,884
Yes. Help me find him!

21
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:03,961
Stay calm.

22
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:08,845
Guys,

23
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:11,038
I want Song Pai's location
in one minute.

24
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,499
Call them!

25
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:15,345
Got it.

26
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:20,538
Guys, make that 30 seconds.

27
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,307
We have to find him right now!

28
00:02:58,999 --> 00:02:59,768
Let me go!

29
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:02,730
My queen,

30
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,268
you can't escape me.

31
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,730
Release me!

32
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:27,115
What's the matter?

33
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:35,615
Guan Xinrui,

34
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,038
do you hate me that much?

35
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:39,845
Lan Yue,

36
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,422
you'll never have me.

37
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:44,807
Not in this life or the next.

38
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:45,807
Guan Xinrui…

39
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,580
(Desperate to find Guan Mengmeng,)

40
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,030
(Song Pai lost his footing and fell.)

41
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,780
(He slipped into a coma.)

42
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,940
(This is a perfect opportunity for me.)

43
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:04,692
Guan Mengmeng,
you were doomed to lose to me.

44
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,845
(I can steal your boyfriend.)

45
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,692
(I can steal your prince too.)

46
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,461
My trusted source

47
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,653
says he's in this room.

48
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,268
A homestay?

49
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:30,499
You don't think…

50
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:39,922
What are you two doing?

51
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:42,961
It's you!

52
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:45,268
Mengmeng!

53
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,807
Are you all right, Mengmeng?

54
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:49,961
I'm Guan Mengmeng!

55
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,153
Insolent!

56
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,350
How dare you address
my princess consort by her name!

57
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,090
Don't you dare lay a finger

58
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,461
on my princess consort!

59
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:05,730
Take a good look

60
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,384
at who I am,

61
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:10,922
and who she is.

62
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:27,422
Pai…

63
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:31,730
Don't let her manipulate you.

64
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:40,422
Song Pai!

65
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,115
Drop the act, An Man.

66
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:47,610
It's all right, Mengmeng.

67
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:48,922
Everything's fine.

68
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:55,845
Fine.

69
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,115
I'll let you two carry on then.

70
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:00,615
Let's go, Qi.

71
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:03,884
You…

72
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:05,750
You'll get what's coming to you!

73
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:08,999
Are you all right?

74
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,884
I'm fine.

75
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:11,922
Everything's okay.

76
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:23,692
Mengmeng,

77
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,230
please stop crying.

78
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:32,307
Mengmeng,

79
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,076
look. I'll show you a magic trick.

80
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:34,845
I'm a flower.

81
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:39,615
You're breaking my heart.

82
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,499
My Song Pai doesn't want me anymore…

83
00:06:43,884 --> 00:06:46,576
He doesn't want me anymore…

84
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,153
Qi…

85
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:50,692
Give me a moment.

86
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:51,730
I'll get justice for you.

87
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,220
(Buddha's Palm)

88
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,576
Song Pai,

89
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:00,076
prepare to face judgment!

90
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:18,999
What?

91
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:22,461
The First Prince and that girl
disappeared in China?

92
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:23,884
Yes.

93
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:26,345
Does His Majesty know?

94
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:30,115
His Majesty is yet
to be made aware of this.

95
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:33,076
Good.

96
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,768
Make sure they never return.

97
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,961
Lock down all news about
their disappearance in China at once.

98
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,230
Understood.

99
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:56,307
Please excuse me, Your Majesty.

100
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,653
My Song Pai doesn't want me anymore…

101
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,307
Stop crying, Mengmeng.

102
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:37,845
Qi…

103
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:38,845
What happened to you?

104
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,999
I'm fine. Song Pai was no match for me.

105
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,153
I beat him up real good.

106
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:45,922
Let me see you.

107
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:47,768
I'm fine.

108
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,538
I'll tell you this.

109
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,268
He got it worse than I did.

110
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:52,845
Trust me.

111
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:55,060
He won't be getting out of bed
for at least a few days.

112
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:57,576
Forget it, Qi.

113
00:08:58,076 --> 00:08:58,922
I'm fine.

114
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:02,153
Let's go. I can't stay here
a second longer.

115
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:02,999
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:05,268
Mengmeng,

117
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:06,422
where are you going?

118
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:08,230
Guan Mengmeng.

119
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:10,961
What do you think you're doing?
Who is he?

120
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,807
You're the First Princess of Manbo.

121
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,268
How can you leave with some random man?

122
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,499
Mengmeng and I grew up together.

123
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:23,576
We're childhood friends
from the same orphanage.

124
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,990
You should be asking the guy
you're supposed to keep in line.

125
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:30,768
My guy? You mean…

126
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,538
Song Pai, this place is beautiful.

127
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,692
Let's take some photos here.

128
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,576
Sure, Mengmeng.

129
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:36,090
Give me the phone. I'll take the photo.

130
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,653
What's going on?

131
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:53,153
Why did my brother

132
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,038
call that woman "Mengmeng"?

133
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,422
From what I can tell,

134
00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:00,384
he probably hit his head when he fell
off the mountain and lost his memory.

135
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:05,422
Amnesia?

136
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:07,499
That's so cliché.

137
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,576
Are you for real?

138
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,153
He lost his memories?

139
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:13,076
Even if that's true,
why does he think An Man is Mengmeng?

140
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:14,692
How should I know?

141
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:22,961
The necklace.

142
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,115
That's my necklace!

143
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,345
Qi,

144
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:28,422
she has my necklace!

145
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:34,153
An Man, that thief!

146
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,461
She's a thief!

147
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:44,384
Pai,

148
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,115
I don't get it.

149
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,845
Why are you so sure
An Man is Guan Mengmeng?

150
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:53,038
I didn't get it wrong.

151
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,038
The An Man
you're talking about is Mengmeng.

152
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:00,884
Fine.

153
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,384
You say

154
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,538
An Man is Mengmeng.

155
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,653
How do you prove this Mengmeng
is that Mengmeng?

156
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:07,807
Easy.

157
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:08,961
The golden snake necklace.

158
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,590
Just because of a necklace,

159
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:15,884
you're sure

160
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,307
she's Mengmeng?

161
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:18,692
Lin Ge,

162
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:19,576
listen carefully.

163
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:24,884
Only Mengmeng can possess
the golden snake necklace.

164
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:29,461
And it's hanging right around her neck.

165
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:33,961
If she's not Guan Mengmeng, who is?

166
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,499
I don't follow your logic.

167
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:37,576
You…

168
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,384
Mengmeng,

169
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,845
I'll teach him a lesson
for you right now.

170
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,538
You'll regret this, Pai.

171
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:53,845
You're impossible to reason with.

172
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:01,692
Let him believe whatever he wants.

173
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:03,268
Mengmeng…

174
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,538
Song Pai.

175
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:11,845
Mengmeng!

176
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,361
Mengmeng.

177
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:25,630
Mengmeng.

178
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:28,438
What's wrong?

179
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:29,438
Don't mind Song Pai.

180
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,784
He's an idiot.

181
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,784
I can't be bothered about him.

182
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,861
I won't waste my time on him.

183
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,400
Besides,

184
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,938
I need to make money.

185
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,438
If men can't be trusted,

186
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,554
then I'll rely on myself.

187
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,630
As if I'd cry my heart out for him.

188
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,707
I could care less about him.

189
00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:01,669
Mengmeng,

190
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,938
you're so upset.

191
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:06,669
I think you might have fallen for him.

192
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,938
Me?

193
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:11,015
In love with him?

194
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,592
Don't be ridiculous.

195
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,707
He couldn't even tell An Man from me.

196
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,390
How could I love a man like that?

197
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:20,784
Ridiculous.

198
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:22,938
Mengmeng.

199
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:26,592
You might fool me,

200
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:29,130
but you can't fool yourself.

201
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:38,169
There, there.

202
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:41,977
Let's forget about him.

203
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:43,169
Don't cry.

204
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:48,630
Song Pai.

205
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:52,900
Let's go.

206
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,554
We'll forget about them.
