00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,980
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,500
Why? You can't even recognize me,

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,180
yet you still treat me
with such affection.

5
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:41,292
Song Pai.

6
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:42,754
Mengmeng…

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,908
What should I do?

8
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:32,155
Guan Mengmeng.

9
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:35,694
I'll show you

10
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:39,309
I'm not someone you can mess with.

11
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:41,963
Who's there?

12
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:43,886
An Man, what do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:44,925
Guan Mengmeng.

14
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,386
I'll kill you!

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,348
Have you lost your mind?

16
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:55,232
You'd burn everything down

17
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:58,040
just to kill me?

18
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,963
Me? Lost my mind?

19
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:15,617
Perhaps.

20
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,771
All of you only ever saw
the surface of who I am.

21
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,732
You only wanted to use me.

22
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:24,617
Not one of you ever cared about me.

23
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:27,155
An Man.

24
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,694
What's gotten into you?

25
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,386
What happened?

26
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:31,348
You can tell me.

27
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,540
You can tell me about it.

28
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:36,194
Tell you

29
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,002
so you can mock me?

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,617
Never!

31
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:51,578
An Man!

32
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,848
Come to your senses!

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,735
Do you understand what you're doing?

34
00:02:58,654 --> 00:02:59,423
Sorry.

35
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,577
I did all of this
because I was forced into it.

36
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:06,923
I didn't want any of this.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,515
It was that scoundrel Zhong Cheng.

38
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:16,746
His investments failed

39
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,900
and he blamed me for it.

40
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:20,746
He was ruthless

41
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:24,054
and abandoned me.

42
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,477
I couldn't take it
and almost ended my life.

43
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,246
If a Chinese man hadn't saved me,

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,438
I'd be dead right now.

45
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,400
I followed that kindhearted Chinese man

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,208
and barely made it here.

47
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:52,515
So

48
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,823
why did you try to burn me alive?

49
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:57,669
Do you hate me that much?

50
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,977
It's all your fault, Guan Mengmeng!

51
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:05,900
If it weren't for you, I would never
have met that scumbag Zhong Cheng!

52
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,054
And now

53
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,438
that I'm finally
about to live a good life,

54
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,015
you come back
and try to take Song Pai from me.

55
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,631
Why do you get to be the Princess?

56
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,554
Why do you get all the men?

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,246
What makes you better than me?

58
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:28,131
I can't accept this!

59
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:36,092
An Man, it's okay. It's okay, An Man.

60
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,708
I don't need your pity!

61
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:40,477
You need me.

62
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,515
I don't need it!

63
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:45,323
Guan Mengmeng.

64
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,708
Do you think Song Pai really loves you?

65
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:56,131
He only loves you
because of that golden snake necklace.

66
00:04:58,362 --> 00:04:59,169
Look at me now.

67
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:02,438
I'm wearing the necklace,

68
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,015
and hasn't Song Pai fallen for me?

69
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:07,323
What is it about the necklace?

70
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,515
What do you know?

71
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:09,900
Tell me.

72
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:21,131
The Chinese man
who pulled me out of despair

73
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,592
was a travel writer.

74
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,323
He had an ancient book.

75
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,785
That book recorded a legend.

76
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,938
A secret legend
of the Manbo royal family.

77
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:37,746
Whoever possesses
the golden snake necklace

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,131
will win the king's love.

79
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,131
So I followed you the whole way,

80
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,938
doing everything I could
to steal that necklace.

81
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:52,746
Is what you're saying true?

82
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,592
That's absurd.

83
00:05:59,015 --> 00:05:59,823
Yeah.

84
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:03,015
It really is.

85
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:12,285
I have the golden snake necklace.

86
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:15,246
I took your place.

87
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,092
So why can't
the power of the golden snake

88
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,169
stop Song Pai from loving you?

89
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,631
Why?

90
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,285
Tell me why!

91
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,285
An Man.

92
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,515
Don't destroy your life

93
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,785
over a man.

94
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:44,054
An Man,
you've already been through enough.

95
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:47,554
Let it go.

96
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,515
If Song Pai will think
you're Guan Mengmeng forever,

97
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:05,400
I hope you'll treat him well.
Can you do that?

98
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:15,708
I promise.

99
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:18,631
I'll be good to him.

100
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:20,977
He's yours.

101
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:24,823
I'm entrusting him to you.

102
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:45,168
Mengmeng,

103
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:48,630
we should go with you.

104
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,245
I want to clear my head on my own.

105
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:02,899
If you're leaving, then go already.

106
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,245
Stop dragging it out.

107
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,130
All right,
you tough-on-the-outside softie.

108
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,707
We've had plenty
of bad moments between us.

109
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:13,822
But the two of you

110
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,938
are my best friends in Manbo now.

111
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,515
I hope we meet again.

112
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:22,784
Okay.

113
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,092
Bye.

114
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:35,130
Guan Mengmeng!

115
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,130
Are you really over Song Pai?

116
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,438
If you still care about him,

117
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,476
why are you leaving?

118
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:49,399
The Song Pai

119
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:54,707
who only had eyes for me is gone.

120
00:08:58,168 --> 00:08:59,168
And hey,

121
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:02,438
men are a dime a dozen.

122
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:04,668
Plenty of fish in the sea.

123
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,053
I'm not going to pine over a man

124
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,361
who can't even recognize who I am.

125
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:23,092
Since he's convinced
you're Guan Mengmeng,

126
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,015
then make the most of it.

127
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,361
Goodbye, Mengmeng.

128
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:54,438
Hmph.

129
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,015
She actually left.

130
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:58,092
Yeah.

131
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:01,322
Back at the palace, we couldn't
get rid of her no matter what.

132
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,707
Even if Guan Mengmeng has left,

133
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,090
how long do you plan
to keep lying to Pai?

134
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:08,707
That's right.

135
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:11,053
Lies always get exposed eventually.

136
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:15,438
When that day comes, you'll be doomed.

137
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:19,399
Let's go.

138
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:28,830
An Man.

139
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:30,907
What happened?

140
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:31,945
You can tell me.

141
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,868
You can tell me about it.

142
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,830
Tell you

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,692
so you can mock me?

144
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,780
Never!

145
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,860
An Man!

146
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,323
(The truth is,
none of this is Guan Mengmeng's fault.)

147
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:56,208
(Was I)

148
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,361
(really wrong?)

149
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:14,823
Mengmeng…

150
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:20,477
Mengmeng…

151
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:28,746
Mengmeng…

152
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,246
If Song Pai will think
you're Guan Mengmeng forever,

153
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,900
I hope you'll treat him well.

154
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,592
Can you do that?

155
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:46,554
I promise.

156
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,669
I'll be good to him.

157
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,323
I'm entrusting him to you.

158
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,980
(Guan Mengmeng is a kind person.)

159
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,780
(She loves him so much.)

160
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,820
(I shouldn't have hurt her.)

161
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,500
(I wish we could be friends again.)

162
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:29,815
Mengmeng…

163
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,508
Mengmeng…

164
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:39,469
Mengmeng!

165
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,854
Pai, you're awake.

166
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:50,200
You're awake, Pai.

167
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:53,546
What's the matter, Pai?

168
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:00,084
What's wrong?

169
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:02,508
Are you all right?

170
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:06,238
Are you okay?

171
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:09,969
What's wrong?
