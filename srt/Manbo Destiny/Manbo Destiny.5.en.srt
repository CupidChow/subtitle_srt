1
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,980
=Manbo Destiny=

2
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,820
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,100
Song Pai.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,830
Instead of focusing on
the southern disaster,

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,630
you should first pay attention
to your Guan Mengmeng.

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,900
If someone like her were to become
a Princess of Manbo Kingdom,

7
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,500
it would truly make people

8
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,370
laugh their heads off.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,670
Father.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,230
Mengmeng came

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,430
to Manbo alone for my sake.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,750
Royal rules are numerous.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,030
Mengmeng was unable
to bear them for a time.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,390
I humbly dare

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,550
to request a pardon decree for Mengmeng.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,480
Father.

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,990
Guan Mengmeng's identity
is already in question.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,770
Granting her a pardon decree
would be inappropriate.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,270
Enough.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,450
The First Princess
has indeed come from afar,

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,980
leaving her homeland behind.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,790
Her culture and customs

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,910
do differ greatly from ours.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,110
Since the First Prince

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,670
has raised this request,

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,070
then I shall

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,480
grant her a pardon decree.

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,470
Song Pai.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,390
However,

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,610
you must also pay a corresponding price

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,400
for this pardon decree.

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,890
I am willing to accept punishment.

33
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,060
As for governing
the southern flood disaster,

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,350
you must give it your utmost effort.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,790
Yes.

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,160
I shall not shirk this duty.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,100
Good.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,150
That will conclude
today's court session.

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,510
You are dismissed.

40
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,430
- We respectfully escort Your Majesty.
- We respectfully escort Your Majesty.

41
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,380
Song Pai.

42
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,310
Do you really think
a single pardon decree

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,990
can protect Guan Mengmeng?

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,190
Lin Ge.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
What exactly do you want?

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,720
As long as I have it,

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,960
I can give it to you.

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,870
But your sister-in-law,

49
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,700
you are not allowed to touch.

50
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,950
These useless people.

51
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,780
They cannot
even catch a female con artist.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,230
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Wait.

54
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,270
You.

55
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,690
Turn around.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,910
Her Majesty is talking to you.

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,910
(I am done for.)

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,350
(I walked straight into the trap.)

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,470
Get up.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,230
Come over here.

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,430
Lift your head.

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,190
So it is you.

63
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,660
Guards.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,830
The swindler is here.

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,040
Take her.

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,500
Yes.

67
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,430
Well done, Guan Mengmeng.

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,030
Let me go.

69
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,590
With makeup on, hiding in the crowd,

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,950
I almost did not recognize you.

71
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,390
Let you go?

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,580
You deceived the sovereign
and defied the throne.

73
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,780
Even Song Pai cannot protect you now.

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,910
Maka.

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,870
You old witch.

76
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,750
You are asking for it.

77
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,810
How dare you.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,670
First Prince.

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,270
By the King's verbal decree,

80
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,390
a pardon decree is bestowed
upon the First Princess.

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,990
What?

82
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,790
Your Highness.

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,430
With this pardon decree,

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,080
no matter what Mengmeng did wrong,

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,270
it is all wiped clean.

86
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,270
Release her.

87
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,550
I am sorry, Mengmeng.

88
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,000
I came too late.

89
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,590
If you were any later,

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,950
I would have lost my life.

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,950
Next time, do not run around alone.

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,950
Oh.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,910
Does the wound still hurt?

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
Let me see.

95
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,190
My Queen,

96
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,550
you finally belong to me.

97
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,790
Let go of me.

98
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,350
My Queen, you cannot escape.

99
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,770
Let go of me.

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,150
I said you cannot escape.

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,230
It hurts.

102
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,390
I was not trying to run.

103
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,990
My real identity was exposed,

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,430
and I was afraid you would
lose your chance at the succession.

105
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,710
So I had no choice but to hide.

106
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,790
I am sorry.

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,230
I do not know
what came over me just now.

108
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,870
Are you alright?

109
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,030
I am sorry, Mengmeng.

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,550
Today, I dragged you into this.

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,280
Originally,

112
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,560
I only planned to muddle through

113
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,350
the day we met His Majesty.

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,390
Once the wedding was over,

115
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,390
I would then, in the name of blessings,
ask for a pardon decree for you.

116
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,630
So you had already thought
through a plan,

117
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,030
yet you did not tell me anything.

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,870
I never do anything without certainty.

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,220
Are you sure that on the wedding day,

120
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,990
they will not cause trouble again?

121
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,270
They do not have the nerve.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,750
As long as the wedding is over,

123
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,520
and you become
the First Princess smoothly,

124
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,410
they will no longer
pose a threat to you.

125
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,470
Then in the future, will I not be

126
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,030
living as if walking beside a tiger?

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,630
Do not worry.

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,710
Once the wedding is over,

129
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,950
you will get what you deserve.

130
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,310
Then what are your plans going forward?

131
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,910
The world is unpredictable.

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,750
All I can do is make sure
every move is right.

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,110
Cunning old fox.

134
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,270
Do you remember the first day we met?

135
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,070
Mm.

136
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,630
The reason they
used Lin Ge to try to kill me

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,470
was because they were certain

138
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,450
that I would spare him
for the sake of brotherhood

139
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,750
and not pursue the matter further.

140
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,910
They were far too arrogant.

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,350
Anyone can kill with a borrowed knife.

142
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,830
(This side of Song Pai is terrifying.)

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,560
(MANBO NEWS)
The highly anticipated royal wedding is held today.

144
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,390
The First Prince and the Second Prince

145
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,870
are marrying their princesses
at the same time.

146
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,010
It is a nationwide celebration in Manbo.

147
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,550
Wow, what a beautiful wedding.

148
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,190
Yeah. Look at that.

149
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,990
- Good.
- Good.

150
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,630
(I never expected)

151
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,350
(my first wedding in life)

152
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,410
(to be filled with deals and deception.)

153
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,580
(But at this moment,)

154
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,590
(I can truly feel the romance
of the wedding.)

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,790
(After fate played
so many tricks on me,)

156
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,990
(this is a small kindness
it has granted me.)

157
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,190
(Maybe the future
is full of uncertainty,)

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,070
(but at least in this moment,)

159
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,660
(I want to fully enjoy
this brief happiness.)

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,950
The wedding ceremony officially begins.

161
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,940
May you as husband and wife

162
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,550
live in love

163
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,790
and loyalty.

164
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,370
In times of happiness,

165
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,390
share with each other.

166
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,770
When you face hardship,

167
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,580
support one another.

168
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,490
Uphold the duties of the royal family,

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,050
and for the people,

170
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,030
devote yourselves.

171
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,310
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

172
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,310
This is a wedding gift
crafted by royal artisans

173
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,670
based on traditional designs,
especially made for you.

174
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,670
May your love

175
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,790
be everlasting.

176
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,630
I will bind you to me forever.

177
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,110
What is wrong?

178
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,110
I do not want to wear it.

179
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,730
So many people are watching.

180
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,120
You must wear it.

181
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,710
Alright.

182
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,520
On behalf of the people
of Manbo Kingdom,

183
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,130
I bless you both

184
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,800
to find true love for a lifetime.

185
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,360
From this moment on,

186
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,360
the two of you

187
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,600
are now officially

188
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,820
Princess Consorts.

189
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,350
(So this is how romantic
and lavish a royal wedding is.)

190
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,330
(The wine is already prepared.)

191
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,030
(Then I will just have a small sip.)

192
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,990
(It tastes pretty good.)

193
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,270
(It is my wedding today.)

194
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,480
(Then bottoms up.)

195
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,600
Hi, Qi.

196
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,600
Look where I am.

197
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,480
What are you doing?

198
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,050
Well,

199
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,960
now that the wedding is over,

200
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,590
I will head back first.

201
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,560
Wait a moment.

202
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,150
What is it?

203
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,510
We just got married.

204
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,500
If you go back and sleep right away,

205
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,380
it might raise suspicion.

206
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,710
That makes sense.

207
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,710
Mm.

208
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,770
You are not going to make me
sleep on the couch, are you?

209
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,060
What else would I do?

210
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,170
What are you doing?

211
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,380
I do not care.

212
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,200
You have not showered yet.

213
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,370
You are not allowed on my bed.

214
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,350
- Guan Mengmeng, get down.
- I want to sleep on the bed.

215
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,960
Do not touch my blanket.

216
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,400
Get down, Guan Mengmeng.

217
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,270
Good night.

218
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,110
Get down.

219
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,750
I will not.

220
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,910
Song Pai.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,510
Ah.

222
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,870
You are filthy.

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,110
Get down here.

224
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,030
Oh my God.

225
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,710
Why are you so heavy?

226
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,190
You are really too heavy.

227
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,750
Put me down.

228
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,330
Put me down.

229
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,460
Sleep on

230
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,850
the

231
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,230
couch!

232
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,580
So heavy.
