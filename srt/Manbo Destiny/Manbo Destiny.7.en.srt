2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,060
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,263
This is the latest update.

4
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,378
Recently, severe flooding has ravaged
the southern regions of our country.

5
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:39,417
A large number of homes, farmlands,
and roads have been submerged.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,780
Transportation has been
completely paralyzed.

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,060
Countless civilians have been
forced to leave their homes.

8
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:44,010
They are now displaced.

9
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:44,763
At present,

10
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,917
rescue operations
are underway at full speed.

11
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,494
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:13,686
Are you troubled
by the situation in the south?

13
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:16,570
The flooding there continues to worsen,

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,609
yet the national treasury is strained.

15
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:22,148
At this point,
providing on-site disaster relief

16
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:25,840
has become extremely difficult.

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,648
Did the First Prince not already swear
a binding military oath?

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,686
Your Majesty may as well
set your mind at ease,

19
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:34,648
and await good news
from the First Prince.

20
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,032
Although you are not
Song Pai's birth mother,

21
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,109
it is rare that you place
such trust in him.

22
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:44,763
I watched the First Prince grow up.

23
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:46,840
He is capable and decisive.

24
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,725
The officials all admire him,

25
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,378
and he commands
great respect among the people.

26
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,455
I believe that this time,

27
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,032
he will surely
prove his ability in fundraising.

28
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:58,686
Indeed.

29
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,378
For Manbo Kingdom to have

30
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,340
a First Prince like Song Pai

31
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,686
is truly a blessing

32
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:08,417
for Manbo Kingdom.

33
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:10,494
That is thanks
to Your Majesty's guidance.

34
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:12,725
However,

35
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:15,071
the First Princess
lacks proper etiquette

36
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,917
and upbringing.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,417
It may be better to place her
under my supervision,

38
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:20,840
keep her in the palace,

39
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:22,378
and discipline her for a time.

40
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:30,955
As for the First Princess,

41
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:33,263
you may decide.

42
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:35,378
Yes.

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,532
(Son.)

44
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,032
(I will make sure that he
and the First Princess)

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,686
(are driven out
of the royal family together.)

46
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,238
Your Majesty.

47
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,264
Disaster relief cannot be delayed,

48
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,071
yet the treasury
is under serious strain.

49
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:00,994
Therefore,

50
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,148
I would suggest

51
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,500
that we proceed as we
have in previous years

52
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:06,225
and appeal to the public for donations.

53
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,033
My two sons,

54
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:12,225
what are your thoughts?

55
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:14,879
Your Majesty,

56
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,379
I do not support this approach.

57
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,000
I believe public donations
remain an option.

58
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,610
Last year,

59
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,225
did we not raise one billion?

60
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:25,302
One billion?

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,740
If such an enormous sum

62
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,210
were to be raised from the common people
in such a short time,

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,994
it could easily provoke public backlash.

64
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:36,879
Hmph.

65
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,802
Without raising funds,
where would the money come from?

66
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,648
We could pursue cooperation
with other nations.

67
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:45,609
No.

68
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:47,730
If disasters strike year after year,

69
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,956
are we to depend on
other countries every time?

70
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,032
This is not a plea for aid.

71
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:55,109
It would be structured as trade,

72
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:57,532
with both sides engaging on equal terms.

73
00:03:58,725 --> 00:03:59,994
The funds obtained

74
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,000
would then be used to
assist the disaster victims.

75
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:04,032
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:06,879
To my knowledge,

77
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:08,956
the First Princess

78
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:11,109
controls a cross-border

79
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,571
e-commerce enterprise.

80
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:15,609
First Prince,

81
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,956
bringing forward
such a proposal at this moment

82
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,148
cannot help but raise doubts

83
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:22,802
about your intentions.

84
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:27,609
Mr. Saul,

85
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,648
are you implying

86
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:32,648
that I would use disaster relief
to line my own pockets?

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,879
I would never presume to.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,763
First Prince.

89
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,340
But once such talk begins,

90
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:43,879
it would place the royal family
in a very difficult position.

91
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,263
(That crafty old fox, Saul.)

92
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,690
(He wants to use my company
to drag Song Pai through the mud.)

93
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,955
(No.)

94
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:57,455
(The situation is turning against us.)

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,186
(I need to take the initiative.)

96
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,840
Your Majesty, and Your Highness,

97
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:11,225
the suffering in the south is severe.

98
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,148
As the First Princess,
I cannot stand aside.

99
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,186
However...

100
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,647
What?

101
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,101
Whoever succeeds
in raising the one billion

102
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,716
will be the first to claim credit.

103
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,447
If all the one billion are raised
by the First Prince alone,

104
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,486
would that not suggest the Second Prince

105
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,101
has effectively stepped aside

106
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,330
from the contest
for the position of heir to the throne?

107
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:34,909
What did you say?

108
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,293
I strongly object.

109
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:42,447
Enough.

110
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,101
The two of you,

111
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,755
each will raise
500 million Manbo Coins.

112
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,678
As for how you accomplish it,

113
00:05:58,716 --> 00:05:59,639
that will be left to

114
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:02,255
your own means and abilities.

115
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,216
(Let us see
what they are really made of.)

116
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:07,340
(Once it is out in the open.)

117
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:12,024
Hey.

118
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:12,870
Song Pai.

119
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,240
What were you thinking just now?

120
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,024
Do you even realize what you just did?

121
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,178
I was helping you.

122
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:20,793
You acted too impulsively, Mengmeng.

123
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,215
500 million.

124
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,946
Do you understand
what that amount means?

125
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,523
This is clearly the Queen and Saul

126
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:29,369
setting a trap for the two of us.

127
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,254
But in that situation just now,

128
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:33,254
I had to agree.

129
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:34,890
At least it gives us
a chance to fight back.

130
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,369
If I had refused,

131
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:39,130
we would have been branded as people
who do not care about the victims.

132
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,110
Do you still want to compete
for the position of heir to the throne?

133
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:45,908
But that is 500 million.

134
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,869
If we fail,

135
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,138
I am a prince.

136
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,215
They cannot touch me.

137
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,408
But what about you?

138
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:54,023
They will make you the scapegoat.

139
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:55,331
I do not care.

140
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,331
We signed a contract.

141
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:58,715
That makes us allies.

142
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,369
500 million or 1.5 billion,

143
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,792
even five billion,
I will still take the risk.

144
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:06,600
I still think...

145
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:08,408
But...

146
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,985
Can you at least have some faith in us?

147
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:13,485
I

148
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,331
am Guan Mengmeng,
the one who never loses.

149
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,523
(Ambitious.)

150
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:18,485
(Bold and calculating.)

151
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,600
(I was right about her.)

152
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:20,408
Alright.

153
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,677
I will take you somewhere.

154
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:23,215
Where?

155
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:25,946
Come.

156
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:34,946
A contract?

157
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:36,254
What contract?

158
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:46,677
Why did you bring me here?

159
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,638
This was a place my mother loved
when she was alive.

160
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:54,523
The late Queen.

161
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:57,946
I brought you here

162
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:00,869
hoping she will watch over us

163
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,792
and see us through the fundraising.

164
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:05,292
I have heard

165
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:08,292
that the late Queen was a woman
of great wisdom.

166
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,831
When I was young,
my mother often taught me

167
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,985
to step beyond the palace walls,

168
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,331
to see different landscapes,

169
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:19,831
and experience different cultures.

170
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,292
She wanted me to broaden my knowledge

171
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:24,600
and expand my horizons.

172
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:26,754
But now,

173
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:30,600
both the person she was

174
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:33,138
and the ideals she stood for

175
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,138
have slowly faded from memory.

176
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:44,869
Mother, you eat first.

177
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:49,677
Mother, is it sweet?

178
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,485
It is sweet. My son is so good.

179
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,331
Promise me this,

180
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,908
that one day every commoner

181
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:58,408
will live well and taste
such sweetness too, all right?

182
00:08:58,408 --> 00:08:59,946
I promise I will.

183
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,638
The Noble Consort has arrived.

184
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,800
Spare my life, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,600
Noble Consort, what are you doing?

186
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:23,715
Your Majesty,

187
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,040
I have never once

188
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,792
shown you any disrespect.

189
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:28,390
Nor have I ever intended

190
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,330
for my son, Lin Ge,
to contend for the throne.

191
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:32,023
I beg you,

192
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:34,215
to spare my son and me a path to live.

193
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,869
Why would the Noble Consort
think such a thing?

194
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,715
Whether it is my son Song Pai,

195
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:50,292
or your son Lin Ge,

196
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:52,230
all of the King's sons

197
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,831
have the right to compete
for the position of heir to the throne.

198
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:57,600
This is something the King
and I agreed upon long ago.

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,523
The heir must be chosen for merit.

200
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,062
Song Pai, let us go.

201
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,014
The Queen has fainted.

202
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,360
Quickly, fetch the Imperial Physician.

203
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,552
I will inform the King.

204
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:47,975
(So he is just like me.)

205
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,591
(He lost his mother at a young age.)

206
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,591
So your struggle for the succession
is for your mother.

207
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:05,091
My mother once taught me as well

208
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:07,360
that as a prince,

209
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,168
one must always seek
the well-being of the people.

210
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,975
I am determined to lead Manbo Kingdom

211
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,629
to keep pace with the world.

212
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,091
I want our people

213
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:25,206
to see a broader world,

214
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,975
no longer bound by outdated conventions.

215
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:31,091
One day,

216
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,937
I will tell my mother
that I have done it.

217
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,040
Greetings, Your Highness the late Queen.

218
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:50,283
I am Guan Mengmeng,
your daughter-in-law from China.

219
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,822
Although I am not
your true daughter-in-law,

220
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:56,514
now that I have entered
into a contract with Song Pai,

221
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:57,745
we stand as allies.

222
00:11:58,475 --> 00:11:59,360
Please rest assured.

223
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,668
I will give everything I have

224
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:04,160
to help Song Pai ascend
to the position of heir to the throne.

225
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,052
(Mother.)

226
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,000
(I have found the one destined for me.)

227
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,822
(Even if, for now, I can only keep her
by my side through a contract.)

228
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:15,591
(I believe)

229
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:16,975
(that one day,)

230
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,437
(she will truly come to love me.)

231
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:19,975
(Please bless us with happiness.)

232
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,014
What?

233
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,706
You are now the First Princess
of the Manbo royal family?

234
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,514
Yes.

235
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,245
Weren't you with Mr. Zhong...

236
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:36,245
Hmph.

237
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:38,591
Mr. Xia.

238
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:40,091
Mr. Li.

239
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,860
You have only just started
doing business in Manbo,

240
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,783
so it is normal not to know.

241
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,168
Zhong Cheng

242
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,552
was pushed out by me long ago.

243
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:03,822
It really is her.

244
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,129
It actually is.

245
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:11,860
Then from now on, Ms. Guan...

246
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,206
ah, no,

247
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:13,860
First Princess,

248
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,322
we will rely on your guidance.

249
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,629
A toast to you.

250
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:22,091
Hah.

251
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,937
What kind of Princess is she anyway?

252
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:28,168
You scumbag, why are you here again?

253
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:30,629
Oh my.

254
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,437
My dear Mr. Li,

255
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,437
and my dear Mr. Xia,

256
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:37,552
the two of you

257
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,822
must not let her fool you.

258
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:43,014
What kind of Princess

259
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:45,591
goes out personally
to negotiate business deals?

260
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,168
Zhong Cheng,

261
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:50,014
do you not follow the news at all?

262
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:53,129
Mr. Li,

263
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:54,668
if the two of you

264
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,206
continue working with her,

265
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,930
you could be heading
for serious trouble at any moment.

266
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:02,399
Why not

267
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,322
continue partnering with me instead?

268
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:06,629
The contracts

269
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,014
have already been prepared for you.
