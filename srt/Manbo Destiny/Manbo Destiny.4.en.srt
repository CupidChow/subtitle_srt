00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,930
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,450
The Second Princess did very well.

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,230
First Princess.

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,470
It is your turn.

6
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,030
Your hand.

7
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,310
Higher!

8
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,190
What are you doing?

9
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,330
Why did you hit me again?

10
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,870
The First Princess did not do well.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,230
You deserve to be punished.

12
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,330
I have walked back and forth
no fewer than ten times.

13
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,230
Every time you find an excuse to hit me.

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,750
Try hitting me one more time.

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,300
Miss Maka did the right thing.

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,510
If it is not corrected now,

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,390
at the wedding,

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,190
losing face for you
would be a minor matter.

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,230
The First Prince represents
the entire royal family.

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,460
Where are you

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,270
supposed to put his dignity then?

22
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,520
You...

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,900
If you want to stay in the royal family,

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,750
you must follow the royal

25
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,510
rules.

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,700
Since Miss Maka mentioned rules,

27
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,600
then let us talk about them.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,710
Miss Maka is the first one
who broke the rules.

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,350
The Second Princess is speaking to me.

30
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,110
Why are you interrupting?

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,460
How dare you.

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,190
She is the Queen's
principal lady in waiting.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,750
How dare you strike her.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,670
Are you disregarding the Queen?

35
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,070
The Second Princess is right.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,070
Miss Maka dared to strike a princess.

37
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,720
Is she disregarding the First Prince,

38
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,030
or disregarding the royal family?

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,320
First Princess.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,580
I was wrong.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,030
Such a sharp tongue.

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,600
You are nothing
more than Song Pai's tool.

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,830
Do you really think
he wants to marry you?

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,410
Since you say I am Song Pai's tool,

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,620
then Second Princess,

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,230
whose tool are you?

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,790
Alright.

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,430
I have practiced enough too.

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,460
I will head back first.

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,510
Stop right there.

51
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,360
What do you want?

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,400
Want to fight?

53
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,270
I suggest you be more careful.

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,310
This royal family is not somewhere
you can stay just because you want to.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,230
Besides,

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,110
Song Pai is not what you imagine.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,990
Do not fantasize

58
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,910
that he can be used by you.

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,630
Whether I can stay

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,670
depends on my mood.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,990
What does it have to do
with the Second Princess?

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,510
Also,

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,700
the Second Princess
keeps bringing up Song Pai.

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,410
Why?

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,100
Are you trying to rekindle old feelings?

66
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,010
Sorry,

67
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,630
that is already impossible.

68
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,530
He

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,830
is mine now.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,550
You...

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,780
Remember this.

72
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,330
I,

73
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,560
Guan Mengmeng,

74
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,350
am not someone to mess with.

75
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,230
Hmph.

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,850
Guan Mengmeng.

77
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,390
Guan Mengmeng.

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,390
Guan Mengmeng.

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,130
Hey.

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,750
First Prince and Second Prince arrive.

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,810
(Wow.)

82
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,860
(That acting would be wasted)

83
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,300
(if you did not become an actress.)

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,830
Why did you hit me?

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,420
Mengmeng.

86
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,140
Mengmeng.

87
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,670
Get up first.

88
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,870
I have already been trying
very hard to learn.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,950
Why do you still have to hit me?

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,950
Wen Shanna.

91
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,920
Out of respect for you
as Lin Ge's princess,

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,430
I have tolerated you again and again.

93
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,190
But today you actually
dared to threaten Mengmeng.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,300
I did not.

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
It was clearly her.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,570
Song Pai.

97
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,070
We had no idea what happened just now.

98
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,370
Maybe

99
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,170
Guan Mengmeng staged it herself.

100
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,320
Lin Ge.

101
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,680
Do not blame them.

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,180
It really is because I am stupid.

103
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,950
I learn too slowly.

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Lin Ge.

105
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,100
You should show more respect
to your sister in law.

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,190
She is such a fragile woman.

107
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,030
Yet she is already crying like this now.

108
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,870
Do not cry anymore, Mengmeng.

109
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:50,930
Your Highness.

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,950
She is not gentle at all.

111
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,190
Just now,

112
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,310
she even struck me hard.

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,310
She hit you?

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,510
Yes, Your Highness.

115
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,430
Then you must have done
something utterly unforgivable.

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,020
To actually provoke my gentle princess.

117
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,320
Speak.

118
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,430
What exactly did you do?

119
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,320
Your Highness, please spare us.

120
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,460
We

121
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,930
will never dare again.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,460
Baofan.

123
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,990
Here.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,700
Drag them away.

125
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,350
Punish them severely.

126
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,990
Yes.

127
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,780
No.

128
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,350
Wait.

129
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,450
She belongs to the Queen.

130
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,210
She is the Queen's person.

131
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,730
Then whose person are you?

132
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,380
She

133
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,070
is my person now.

134
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,660
Then keep your people in line.

135
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,340
Do not be afraid. Let us go.

136
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,710
Guan Mengmeng.

137
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,920
My noble Miss Guan,

138
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,700
how long do you plan to let me hold you?

139
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,960
Is the First Prince really that weak?

140
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,730
You cannot even handle this short walk?

141
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,210
Stop pretending.

142
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,220
Anyone could tell you
were fake crying just now.

143
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,920
You saw through it long ago.

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,510
If anyone tries to make things hard
for you again,

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
remember to come find me.

146
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,100
That will not be necessary.

147
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,720
I can beat anyone,

148
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,790
anywhere, on my own.

149
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,830
Hmph.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,350
They really hit you?

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,910
Why else would I go after them?

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,400
What are you doing now?

153
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,050
Let go of me.

154
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,280
It is not what you think.

155
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,420
You are just like Song Pai,

156
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,600
trusting a foreign woman
instead of me, is that it?

157
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,970
You still have the nerve to say that.

158
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,350
You cannot even beat a foreign woman.

159
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,490
Do you know how embarrassing
that is for me?

160
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,310
It is all because that Guan Mengmeng
is too scheming.

161
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,110
Come here.

162
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,870
Do not move.

163
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,590
Does it still hurt?

164
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
It does not hurt anymore.

165
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,190
I told you not to move.

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,350
Here. I will apply some medicine
near your ear too.

167
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,870
I will do this part myself.

168
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,590
You cannot see it.
How would you apply it?

169
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,910
Ah.

170
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,030
Why are you suddenly being so kind?

171
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,680
No.

172
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,800
You are injured. It is normal
for me to apply medicine for you.

173
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,410
Besides, I am worried you
will be left with a scar.

174
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,600
Then you might back out
of the contract again.

175
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,190
You can rest assured.

176
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,490
We are only
in a contractual relationship.

177
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,110
Once the three months are up,

178
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,380
I will take my money

179
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,710
and leave far away.

180
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,870
Then you should apply it yourself.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,110
So strange.

182
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,820
Do you want some?

183
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,160
No.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,190
Do not worry.

185
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,710
This is our little secret.

186
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
I will not tell anyone.

187
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,950
Alright?

188
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,820
Come.

189
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,740
Pinky swear.

190
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,680
This is for you.

191
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,510
Our little Princess Wanida,
you're so adorable.

192
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,110
Unlike your eldest and second brothers,

193
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,630
who fight each other
all day to the death.

194
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,830
Second Brother
really likes Eldest Brother.

195
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,630
Ah?

196
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,110
Wanida.

197
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,020
So you are here, Wanida.

198
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,600
Second Brother
really likes Eldest Brother.

199
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,750
What did you say?

200
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,120
Where did you run off to?

201
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,430
You gave Mother such a fright.

202
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,310
Little Princess Wanida

203
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,970
just wanted to share some food with me.

204
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,870
Please do not scold her.

205
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,590
For the First Princess's sake,

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,750
let this one go.

207
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,510
Hurry and thank the First Princess.

208
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,670
Let us go.

209
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Thank you, First Princess.

210
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,800
Bye bye, First Princess.

211
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,260
Goodbye, First Princess.

212
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,030
Bye bye.

213
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,670
Goodbye.

214
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,870
Lin Ge

215
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,680
really likes Song Pai?

216
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,190
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

217
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,350
Your Majesty.

218
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,850
I

219
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,470
returned yesterday
from the southern disaster area.

220
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,520
The southern disaster area

221
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,830
has suffered severe devastation.

222
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,060
The people

223
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,000
have been displaced.

224
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,950
You two princes,

225
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,990
regarding disaster relief,

226
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,510
what are your views?

227
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,350
Father,

228
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,470
I wish to request permission

229
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,030
to actively develop
cross border e-commerce,

230
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,110
to bring greater benefits to our people.

231
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,470
Your Majesty,

232
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,960
I object.

233
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,270
For so many years, we have
handled disaster relief ourselves

234
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,230
and remained self sufficient.

235
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,830
Yet the people are still suffering.

236
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,670
If we cling to outdated ideas,

237
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,710
how can our nation grow strong?

238
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,250
Father,

239
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,860
I also disagree.

240
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,870
Our people are hardworking
and independent.

241
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,100
With the support of the state,

242
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,710
they will surely overcome this hardship.

243
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,110
But if we rely only on
royal relief as in previous years,

244
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,430
how many more will be left displaced?

245
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,930
Guan Mengmeng

246
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,900
is not the daughter of Huasheng Group,

247
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,750
but an orphan with no one to rely on.

248
00:12:59,330 --> 00:12:59,970
What?

249
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,590
Outrageous.

250
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,600
She dared to deceive
the Manbo royal family.

251
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,990
Pass down my order.

252
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,960
Arrest Guan Mengmeng immediately.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,630
Yes.

254
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,430
(Guan Mengmeng)

255
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,030
(fabricating her identity,)

256
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,630
(and deceiving the royal family.)

257
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,470
(I will see
where you can run this time.)

258
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,030
(Oh no.)

259
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,910
(My identity was exposed so quickly.)

260
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,870
(I must get through this first,)

261
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,830
(then discuss countermeasures
with Song Pai.)

262
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,790
(You cannot see me,)

263
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,150
(you cannot see me.)

264
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,950
(Great,)

265
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,390
(I was not discovered.)

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,670
Hi.

267
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,550
What a coincidence.

268
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,550
Guards.

269
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,350
Do not shout.

270
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,750
I am warning you.

271
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,310
My gun has no eyes.

272
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,350
Watch your mouth.

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,670
Otherwise,

274
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,310
I will not spare you.

275
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,310
Guan Mengmeng.

276
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,030
You dared to play me.

277
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,710
Guards!

278
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,190
Seize her.
