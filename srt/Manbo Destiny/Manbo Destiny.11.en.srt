=Episode 11=

3
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:37,862
Does it hurt?

4
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:39,515
This one.

5
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:44,400
Hold it.

6
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,708
Do you know what this is?

7
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:01,592
Guan Mengmeng.

8
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,092
Even if the king himself
showed up today, no one's saving you.

9
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:07,515
You little wench.

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,720
Do you have any idea
how badly you ruined me?

11
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:10,631
Huh?

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,554
Let's see how I deal with you.

13
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:13,092
Come on.

14
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:13,938
Take the hood off.

15
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:15,669
Hurry up! Take her hood off.

16
00:01:21,169 --> 00:01:22,131
Song Pai?

17
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:24,477
Useless fool!

18
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:26,323
You kidnapped the wrong person.

19
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:31,400
We already have him. Maybe we just…

20
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:34,477
Even if you want to die,

21
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,438
don't drag me down with you.

22
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:37,323
Let him go. Now.

23
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:40,938
And

24
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:42,515
don't you dare expose me.

25
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,515
If you do,

26
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:45,631
you'll lose both your money

27
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,131
and your life.

28
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:52,477
Bah!

29
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:54,592
Who do you think you are?

30
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,169
I'm not your servant

31
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,054
to order around.

32
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,323
Crazy woman.

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,438
So what if you're the First Prince?

34
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:14,246
Huh?

35
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,246
I'd like to see
who's coming to save you now.

36
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:19,477
Hmph.

37
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:22,131
Your Highness,

38
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,323
if you die,

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,160
do you really think
that little wretched Mengmeng

40
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,169
will make it out of Manbo Kingdom alive?

41
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:46,823
You two…

42
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:00,054
Do you even know who I am?

43
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,323
You punk!

44
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:05,669
You dare steal our boss's woman?

45
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,092
The punk you're talking about

46
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:11,592
is the First Prince of Manbo Kingdom.

47
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,054
If you're a prince,

48
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:16,246
then I'm your dad.

49
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,554
Is he really a prince?

50
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:32,823
- No way!
- No way!

51
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:34,708
What's wrong?

52
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:35,823
Sir,

53
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:36,631
please sit.

54
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:37,592
Please sit, sir.

55
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:40,015
You can

56
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:40,554
untie me now.

57
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,785
My hands are numb.

58
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,054
Sorry, sir.

59
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:45,015
Please sit.

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,938
Massage my shoulders and neck.

61
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,400
Do a good job and I'll make you
captain of the royal guards.

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Captain of the Royal Guards
of Manbo Kingdom.

63
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,900
Thank you, sir.

64
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,477
My hands are a bit numb.

65
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:57,390
That will do.

66
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:58,823
Does that feel good?

67
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,477
Is this okay, sir?

68
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,390
Put some strength into it.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,192
I see how it is.

70
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,385
You play dirty.

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,360
You want to fight me?

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,600
Try again in your next life.

73
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,457
Baofan!

74
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,298
Zhong Cheng, how could you hit me?

75
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,452
What are you doing?

76
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:26,298
Zhong Cheng!

77
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,452
Sir!

78
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,490
Oh my goodness!

79
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:30,183
You actually hit me!

80
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:31,221
I didn't hit you.

81
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:31,990
Baofan!

82
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:35,798
We're on the same side.

83
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:37,567
Who hit you?

84
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:38,260
He did.

85
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,837
Who hit you?

86
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,875
What's your problem? I didn't hit you!

87
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,183
Ah!

88
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,567
He…

89
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:46,490
He was about to whip me with his belt.

90
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,298
Zhong Cheng!

91
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,529
I didn't hit him!

92
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:49,721
I didn't touch him at all!

93
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,029
Don't listen to his nonsense!

94
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,644
What's wrong?

95
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,760
It might be an internal injury…

96
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,837
An internal injury?

97
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,567
No…

98
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:24,990
You're fine.

99
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,875
Mengmeng, don't leave.

100
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,529
I'm not leaving.

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,546
This is all my fault.

102
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:30,030
If it weren't for…

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,738
If it weren't for…

104
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,238
If it weren't for Zhong Cheng
asking me out

105
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:33,431
and me wanting to catch him,

106
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,431
I… I wouldn't have shown up.

107
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:36,123
It's okay.

108
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:36,777
I'm fine.

109
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:37,738
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,354
Just stay with me.

111
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:40,161
I'm staying.

112
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:40,469
Mengmeng.

113
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:41,260
I'll be right here.

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,330
I'm not going anywhere.

115
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:45,931
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:46,900
I'll stay with you.

117
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,700
I'm sorry, Mother.

118
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:04,200
This was my mistake.

119
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,585
I meant to kidnap Guan Mengmeng

120
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,508
and force Song Pai
to stop the fundraising,

121
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,123
but I didn't expect…

122
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:11,661
I didn't expect you

123
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,661
and your useless subordinates

124
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:15,123
to kidnap the wrong person.

125
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:16,046
Absurd.

126
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:25,661
You've disappointed me.

127
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:29,546
Lin Ge?

128
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,008
Why are you here?

129
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:32,123
Mother.

130
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,880
What is it this time
that made you punish Nana?

131
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:36,931
I had no choice.

132
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,046
But you can't do this to her every time…

133
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:39,738
It's my honor

134
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:41,315
to receive Mother's guidance.

135
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:50,161
Mother,

136
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,469
if you ever torture Nana again,

137
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:54,392
I will turn against you.

138
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:58,623
Lin Ge!

139
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,070
What nonsense are you talking about?

140
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:00,777
Come back!

141
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:01,700
Get back here!

142
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:12,800
Boss,

143
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,646
we've confirmed it.

144
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:15,360
Zhong Cheng works
for the Second Princess.

145
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,390
For now, we don't know where he is.

146
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:18,454
Wen Shanna again.

147
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:20,992
I got it. You're dismissed.

148
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:48,721
Why is it still dark?

149
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,380
(Dark?)

150
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:51,606
(He must still be delirious.)

151
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:53,029
Guan Mengmeng.

152
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,220
Mengmeng!

153
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,290
I can't see. Mengmeng, where are you?

154
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,980
Song Pai.

155
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,420
Mengmeng!

156
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,613
I'm here.

157
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:02,460
I can't see.

158
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:03,960
I'm right here, Song Pai.

159
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:06,498
Why can't I see anything?

160
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:08,921
Good grief…

161
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:10,960
Song Pai!

162
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,690
How many fingers am I holding up?

163
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,113
How many?

164
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:15,498
One.

165
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:16,152
Look.

166
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,267
- How many fingers am I…
- I can't see, Mengmeng!

167
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:20,383
Call the doctor, Mengmeng!

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,915
Doctor, how is he?

169
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:31,761
His Highness…

170
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,208
Your Highness,
I'm afraid you've gone blind.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,490
I'll go get some medicine for you.

172
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,020
All right…

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,162
Guan Mengmeng…

174
00:08:46,354 --> 00:08:48,277
You wouldn't abandon me, would you?

175
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,585
I wouldn't.

176
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:50,546
I would never.

177
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:51,931
Don't worry.

178
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,585
Really?

179
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:53,508
Yes.

180
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:54,680
You'll get your eyesight back.

181
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,585
The doctor said so.

182
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,354
He went to prepare your medicine.

183
00:08:58,354 --> 00:08:59,239
I don't believe it.

184
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:01,431
You will get better.

185
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:02,180
I don't believe it.

186
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:04,393
Isn't that how it always goes
in the movies?

187
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,431
The male lead goes blind
and the female lead leaves.

188
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,662
I won't stop you
if you really want to go, Mengmeng.

189
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:10,931
What are you going on about?

190
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:12,239
Oh, baby.

191
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,190
I would never leave you.

192
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:20,700
I won't abandon you. Don't worry.

193
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,393
Let me apply the medicine.

194
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:25,239
Be good.

195
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,290
Let's apply the medicine.

196
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,790
Father, there's no need for formalities.

197
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,777
Protocol cannot be neglected.

198
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:52,546
Greetings,

199
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:55,508
Second Princess.

200
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:58,662
Father, please be seated.

201
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,008
Sit with me, my dear.

202
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:14,816
Father.

203
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:17,316
I haven't finished raising the funds

204
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,623
for the Second Prince yet.

205
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:21,623
You don't need to explain.

206
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:24,431
You are the most

207
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:27,700
outstanding woman
of your generation in our family.

208
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:29,585
For now,

209
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,239
endure what comes from the Queen.

210
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,470
When you become Queen yourself one day,

211
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,931
there will be no need
to endure anything.

212
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,585
Thank you
for your understanding, Father.

213
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:42,085
As for that Guan Mengmeng…

214
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,777
How dare she make a fool of my daughter.

215
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,277
Father,

216
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,777
don't you think there's something
strange about Guan Mengmeng?

217
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:53,739
Do you think it's because

218
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:55,931
she hails from
that mysterious Eastern nation?

219
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:58,931
One Guan Mengmeng is nothing

220
00:10:58,931 --> 00:10:59,854
to fear.

221
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:02,585
Your priority right now

222
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,277
is to become Queen.

223
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:07,085
Once you are Queen,

224
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,508
our family's position will be secure.

225
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:11,316
You will bring honor

226
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:13,508
to our family.

227
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:16,046
Father.

228
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,390
I'm afraid I won't be able
to live up to your expectations.

229
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:20,777
Nana,

230
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:22,854
you're my daughter.

231
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,695
I believe you have what it takes.

232
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,564
No one but you

233
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,487
can shoulder this responsibility

234
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:31,834
and ensure

235
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,603
our family's prosperity for generations.

236
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:34,757
Nana,

237
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:37,103
you must not let me

238
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:39,603
and the entire family down.

239
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:42,564
I know, Father.

240
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,834
(I must uphold my family's honor.)

241
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,872
(But I don't know how much longer
I can endure this pressure.)

242
00:11:57,757 --> 00:11:58,218
Oh?

243
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,026
First Princess,

244
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:02,526
fancy seeing you here.

245
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:07,564
If I were you,

246
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,064
I'd stop playing tricks.

247
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:10,949
It's better for you

248
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,564
to keep your distance from Zhong Cheng.

249
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,026
You know,

250
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:15,795
I quite envy you.

251
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:17,218
That you can live

252
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,757
so freely.

253
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:21,103
Do you?

254
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:22,257
Here's my warning.

255
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:27,064
I won't give up the succession
over some empty dream.

256
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,026
The position of Crown Prince
belongs to Lin Ge alone.

257
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:31,987
And the title of Queen

258
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:36,257
will only ever be mine.

259
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,177
Then, let's see how it ends.

260
00:12:58,215 --> 00:12:59,062
Wen!

261
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,215
Let's go!

262
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:01,985
If we don't leave now,
it'll be too late.

263
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:02,638
Come on.

264
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:06,754
What's wrong?

265
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:15,446
What's the matter, Wen?

266
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:17,408
Didn't we promise

267
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,177
to run away together,

268
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,254
to escape this place?

269
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,177
Wen?

270
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:27,292
Rui.

271
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,900
You're the officially designated
future Queen of Manbo Kingdom.

272
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
We can't escape.

273
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:35,869
I won't listen to that.

274
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:37,754
I won't have it!

275
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,177
You promised.

276
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:43,754
You promised you'd take me away, Wen.

277
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:46,446
You promised we'd escape together.

278
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:47,254
Come on!

279
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:48,331
Let's go!

280
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:49,369
Look at me!

281
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,023
Where can we escape to?

282
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,408
There's no escape for us.

283
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,446
Wen Shanna!

284
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:04,790
What are you doing?

285
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,023
Let me go!

286
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:13,985
Release her!

287
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,720
Are you all right, Mengmeng?

288
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,869
What happened to me?

289
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:22,408
Guan Mengmeng, what did you do
to me this time?

290
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,677
You did this last time too.
What are you…

291
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:25,177
Wen Shanna, mind your place.

292
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:27,138
Song Pai!

293
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:28,523
You lied to me again!

294
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:30,600
You're supposed to be blind!

295
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,062
