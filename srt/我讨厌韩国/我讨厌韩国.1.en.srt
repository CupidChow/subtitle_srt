1
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:08,170
(Because I Hate Korea)

2
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,520
That day, Ji-Myeong took the

3
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,570
car and drove me to the airport.

4
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,950
He and I officially parted ways at

5
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,240
Incheon Airport on the day of my departure.

6
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,580
Yo, it's...

7
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,540
Almost lost it!

8
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,250
You can't go without it!

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,540
- Gochujan.  - Leave it.

10
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,380
No, you have to remove something heavy.

11
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,220
- What is the point of this?  - Gosh.

12
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,260
Better put it away.

13
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,640
- So bulky... - Not this!

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,760
You can do without it!

15
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,020
Father, let me.

16
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,070
God!

17
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,950
- There is, and what about you? - Fastened.

18
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
I will wait.

19
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,580
No.

20
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,170
You don't have to wait for me.

21
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,380
If it is difficult, you can always return.

22
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,920
And don't eat some junk to save money.

23
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,090
<i>Why did I go?</i>

24
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,600
In short, because I hate Korea.

25
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,190
If a little longer, I can't live here anymore.

26
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,150
Don't criticize me, please.

27
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,900
It is quite natural 
to hate the country where you were born.

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,990
You too have a nice day!

29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,810
(A year ago, winter)

30
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,830
When I worked in an office,

31
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,910
I would wake up every day with tears in my eyes.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,460
- What? - Not because of work, but because of the commute there.

33
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,540
- Hold on!

34
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,500
Have you ever commuted

35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,630
from Incheon to Gangnam during rush hour?

36
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,510
Please wait!

37
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,720
You understand that humanity,

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,300
dignity, or whatever

39
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,560
is nothing in survival conditions.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,900
First I go 12 stops on the bus

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,230
and get off at the subway station.

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,280
Then I take the first line to transfer to the second at the Shimdorim Station.

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,820
After two hours in public transport

44
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,620
I begin to wonder where I went wrong.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,160
As soon as I get to work,

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,540
everything I can think about is getting home.

47
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,380
Even while working

48
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,210
I didn't think very much.

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,300
Even if I were a cog in some organization, I would

50
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,760
not know where this cog fits, how this mechanism

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,680
turns, and in which direction this big cart moves.

52
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,810
- Good morning.   - Hello.

53
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,520
I don't know what I'm doing and why.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,480
I have no idea what the hell this company is doing.

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,730
And I'm not interested either.

56
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,610
The reason I couldn't live in Korea was

57
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,160
because I wasn't a competitive person.

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,580
- Sir, what will you eat?   - Me?

59
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,790
Fish stew.

60
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,250
OK. Auntie, can we have 4 servings of fish stew?

61
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,290
Like an animal that should have gone extinct.

62
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,090
I'm too calm

63
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,840
to do anything crazy.

64
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,890
I did not inherit anything, but demanding as hell.

65
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,310
You know those animals that leopards

66
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,940
always eat in documentaries about Africa?

67
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,940
Like Thomson's gazelle.

68
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,990
There's always one fool

69
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,450
which runs in the other direction and gets attacked?

70
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,790
I'm the same.

71
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,710
If you do not do everything as others, repeating,

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,880
"That's not my headache," you will separate

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,590
yourself from the herd and become a victim of a predator.

74
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,430
But being a gazelle doesn't mean

75
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,140
I'll stand still when the leopard comes.

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,350
No, I'm running as fast as I can to survive.

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,480
That's why I decided to leave Korea.

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,990
Kye-Na.

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,080
Why is there no information about MK Digital in the table?

80
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,000
The results weren't very good, so we decided not to work with them.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,300
But they led this project last time.

82
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,050
There was something strange in last year's documents.

83
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,010
Despite the low score, they won the tender.

84
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
So what?

85
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,560
So I followed the instructions.

86
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,480
No, so what's wrong with MK doing it?

87
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,150
What if we choose another company and everything goes wrong?

88
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,030
How do you know how it will be?

89
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,450
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

90
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,990
Don't you agree? Doesn't everyone do it like this?

91
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,250
Public tenders are arranged for this purpose.

92
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,050
Kye-Na.

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,510
What is most important in relationships between people?

94
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,720
- What? - No.

95
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm asking you what's most important?

96
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,480
How is this relevant to the case?

97
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
You are not flexible at all.

98
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,900
Do you know how much it annoys me?

99
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,320
Is giving work to incompetent suppliers...

100
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,360
- “flexibility”? - No!

101
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,870
We need to trust reliable people!

102
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,580
What do you value most in people?

103
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,040
Trust.

104
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,830
Manager...

105
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,620
You're asking me to fake a score.

106
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,330
I can't do that.

107
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,920
So what if you can't?

108
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,050
I'm quitting!

109
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,310
What is it now?

110
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,680
What? What is it?

111
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,020
You've been offered the director's position? Do you have a lot of money?

112
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,980
You always threaten to quit! Do you know how hard it is for me?

113
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,070
It's not about you.

114
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,410
I'll talk to Director Park myself.

115
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,240
Tomorrow I will bring a resignation letter.

116
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,830
Kye-Na, what happened to you?

117
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,500
Next month we have personnel changes, I

118
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,750
will definitely talk to the HR.

119
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,790
You said the same thing last year.

120
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,920
Everyone who wants to is promoted in the sales department.

121
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,300
I understand you don't like sales or compliance.

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,430
But you agreed to wait until a vacancy appeared elsewhere.

123
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,430
Let's wait a little longer, shall we?

124
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,970
If a vacancy appears in the audit team or elsewhere,

125
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,930
you will be my first candidate, okay?

126
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,440
Thank you, but no.

127
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,070
Kye-Na, am I a joke to you?

128
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,190
I will take responsibility

129
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,450
and handle everything, okay?

130
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,780
What is most important in relationships between people?

131
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,410
Auntie, bring us some soju!

132
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,250
Yeah, so what?

133
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,500
It seems that next month I will be transferred to the administrative department.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,510
Well, you are fearless, Joo Kye-Na.

135
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,630
Really.

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,090
So cool.

137
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,640
This is not so incredible, just when a person is

138
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,650
released, the whole company becomes overflowing.

139
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,730
So my manager was in despair.

140
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,690
You still got lucky with the company.

141
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,740
I'll try it, and if it doesn't work,

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,410
I'll quit.

143
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,370
Quit?

144
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,120
I will leave with Korea soon.

145
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,000
What do you mean?

146
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,380
I decided,

147
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,380
that there are no prospects in Korea.

148
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,800
Kye-Na.

149
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,350
Although there is inequality here,

150
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,970
for hardworking people

151
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,230
this is a country of great opportunities.

152
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,810
In terms of solvency alone,

153
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,060
Korea is among the top 20 in terms of GDP per capita.

154
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,230
It is no different from Spain or Italy.

155
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,900
So, you started studying for the exam and now you know everything?

156
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,650
If it is such a wonderful place to live,

157
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,280
how will you explain the first place in the level of suicide among OECD countries?

158
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,870
I don't understand,

159
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,000
can't we just live in peace?

160
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,580
- I think about it constantly.   - Okay.

161
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,500
You do understand what you are talking about, right?

162
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,550
So what, if you go abroad everything becomes paradise?

163
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,420
Look at immigrants who live in Korea.

164
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,630
They may have studied at the best university in their country,

165
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,260
but here they are just workers.

166
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,760
Do they seem happy?

167
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,760
You are now insulting all immigrants.

168
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,980
Who are you to judge their happiness?

169
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,730
What kind of journalist says that?

170
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,150
Okay, sorry.

171
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,240
If it's that hard, take a break and think things through.

172
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,740
When I find a job,

173
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,120
then I will thank you for all that time,

174
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,040
you fed me, I promise.

175
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,330
You didn't understand anything again!

176
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,420
How many times can you repeat...

177
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,850
K-Kye-Na, we're not finished talking!

178
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,810
How much?

179
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,560
26 thousand won.

180
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,190
Thank you, goodbye.

181
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,570
- Goodbye. - All the best.

182
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,250
Why do you hate Korea so much?

183
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,040
I'm not doing anything wrong,

184
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,420
but my life is not getting better.

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,180
If we continue to live like this,

186
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,140
you will either kill yourself or die of cancer.

187
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,140
Either one or the other.

188
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,730
Do you think things will get better if you leave?

189
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,610
You treat me like I have some alien disease.

190
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,990
But I look at things realistically.

191
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,360
You paid off your student loans.

192
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,160
You have a stable salary,

193
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,700
and...

194
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,620
a handsome boyfreind who is about to get a job.

195
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,870
Isn't that realistic?

196
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,550
As soon as I find a job...

197
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,350
Marry me.

198
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,680
Ji-Myeong and I are the same age.

199
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,980
He is polite, not pretentious,

200
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,980
very responsible and always talks about our future.

201
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,580
If you're going to propose, do it right.

202
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,250
I'm serious.

203
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,000
Really?

204
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,550
Let's see how serious you are.

205
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,180
We met in our first year of university

206
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,850
and we have been together for seven years.

207
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,350
Friends even call us husband and wife.

208
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,190
The problem is that Ji-Myeong

209
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,610
was categorically against my move.

210
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,540
Huh? Joo Kye-Na!

211
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,250
Kyung-Woon?

212
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,800
- Wow! - Long time no see!

213
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,380
Wow!

214
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,380
What are you doing here?

215
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,390
I was going to meet Ji-Myeong.

216
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,470
So you're still dating!

217
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,850
Hey, haven't you graduated yet?

218
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,730
What are you talking about, it's been a long time!

219
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,240
But I haven't moved out of the dorm yet. I'm preparing for exams.

220
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,820
- Really? - Yeah.

221
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,240
I heard you got a job somewhere last year?

222
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,620
Ah, this is...

223
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,040
Well, I got settled, but...

224
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,790
It didn't work.

225
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,760
So Ji-Myeong is graduating soon?

226
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,970
Yes, this is the last semester.

227
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,260
And you are absolutely incredible!

228
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,180
You waited two years while he served,

229
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,890
and now you support him while he looks for a job.

230
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,980
- Well, that's nothing. - Whatever you say.

231
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,230
We need to meet again sometime.

232
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm broke right now, so I can't go out often.

233
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,940
But that's it. Kye-Na,

234
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,070
Next time, treat me to something delicious.

235
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,950
Of course.

236
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,990
So we really agreed?

237
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,290
- Yes. - Treat? Seriously?

238
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,790
Yes, I'll treat you.

239
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,000
- Seriously! - Yes, yes.

240
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,920
Okay.

241
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,750
- I'm leaving. - Goodbye!

242
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,250
- Be careful! - Okay.

243
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
Go!

244
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,470
No, help me!

245
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,810
But where are you going?

246
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,690
Okay, okay, come on!

247
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,230
Don't hit him first, you piece of shit!

248
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,730
Wait, wait.

249
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,650
Okay, let's begin!

250
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,530
Huh? Boy, how...

251
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,350
(Joo Kye-Na, Joo Mi-Na)

252
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,030
Don't follow me! Hey, where are you going...

253
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,280
Because of you we...

254
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,120
Where are you going? Damn it...

255
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,130
This is ridiculous!

256
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,010
What is it?

257
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,390
I hear your keyboard,

258
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,350
can you turn up the micro a little?

259
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,070
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Auckland.

260
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Please remain in your seat and wait for the seat belt indicator to

261
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,830
turn off after the aircraft comes to a complete stop.

262
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,960
When leaving, make sure you haven't forgotten anything

263
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,590
and be careful not to drop anything.

264
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,150
Kye-Na, come here.

265
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,070
Okay.

266
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,990
Come in.

267
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,450
Not bad, right?

268
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,750
There used to be a garage here, but I renovated everything.

269
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,500
You can use all of this,

270
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,050
and if you come out here, you will go straight into the garden.

271
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,710
It is always sunny here.

272
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,550
And if you don't find permanent housing,

273
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,390
you can just stay here.

274
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,850
We'll agree on a cheap rent.

275
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,390
You'll get used to it soon!

276
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,780
Are you planning to stay here?

277
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,450
What?

278
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,240
Many people come to New Zealand,

279
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,700
which were very successful in Korea,

280
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,080
but don't think that everything will be the same here.

281
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,250
If you consider this a new beginning,

282
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
it will be much easier to learn English.

283
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,220
- Okay. - Great.

284
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,390
So, the most important thing is the IELTS result...

285
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,810
No, no.

286
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,270
I will work and study at the same time.

287
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,980
Will it be possible to get a good result?

288
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,280
Yes, of course, of course.

289
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,900
Don't worry.

290
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,530
It's English. You'll learn it slowly.

291
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,240
What is the most important part?

292
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,330
Consider this a new beginning.

293
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,710
Study English diligently, enter graduate school,

294
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,210
get a job and get a residence permit.

295
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,710
Eh?

296
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,970
But everyone says it's harder than it seems...

297
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,140
Yes, it's difficult.

298
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,310
If that doesn't work, catch one of the locals.

299
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,270
Marriage is also an option.

300
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,440
There is a time for everything!

301
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,780
Good afternoon!

302
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,820
Say hello.

303
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,330
Mr. Park Jae-In, with whom you will go to the academy.

304
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,200
And this is Joo Kye-Na.

305
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,330
You're in the same group, so be friends, okay?

306
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,760
I'd better go myself...

307
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,050
Then maybe we should part ways?

308
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,270
I was going to wander around the city, taking my time.

309
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,230
I would be happy to, but we're still going in the same direction, so...

310
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,190
How old are you that you talk so informally?

311
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,780
I am twenty-six.

312
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,610
And I'm twenty-eight.

313
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,910
Really?

314
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,120
I am older...

315
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,580
Mentally, I am ten years older.

316
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,210
That's not how it's done here, didn't you know?

317
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,340
When in Rome, do as Romans do.

318
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,430
I don't think you'll fit into this mentality.

319
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,720
Still thinks this is Korea? What the hell?

320
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,680
Taste it.

321
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,350
- What is this? - Wine.

322
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,270
Are you carrying booze with you?

323
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,190
And treat yourself to some nachos.

324
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,110
All of this together cost less than 10,000 won.

325
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,710
Did you immigrate here?

326
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,790
Does it look like I did?

327
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,460
What did you do in Korea?

328
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,180
Is this an interrogation?

329
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,480
I traveled here on a visa

330
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,320
three years ago, before I joined the army.

331
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
This is the best place I have ever been.

332
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,120
I thought that no matter how difficult it was,

333
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,030
I want to stay here.

334
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,450
In short, that's why I came back.

335
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,080
Why are you here?

336
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,520
I don't really fit in Korea.

337
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,030
I don't have any influential relatives or anything.

338
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,240
And the education is mediocre.

339
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,660
I also barely graduated.

340
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,460
I studied at Hongik University.

341
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,840
Hey!

342
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,470
Drinking in public places is prohibited.

343
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,680
Wine? Ah...

344
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,940
No, no, it's okay, I'm twenty-six.

345
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,150
Everything is okay, okay.

346
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,110
We are legal adults.

347
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,190
Is it English?

348
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,570
Learn the language before you arrive!

349
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,870
Ok...

350
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,620
Sure...

351
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,000
Hey, get up.

352
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,300
Get up, I need to sleep, get out.

353
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,970
Get up quickly.

354
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,110
Mom, we need to fix the boiler, I'm freezing.

355
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,320
Be patient a little longer.

356
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,110
We will be moving soon.

357
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,790
You remember that you have to

358
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,410
pay the balance for the apartment?

359
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,960
There were 60 and 80 square meter ones.

360
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,840
We decided to take the larger one.

361
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,510
So you should help too.

362
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,800
Where will she get that money?

363
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,970
Don't mind her.

364
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,350
We'll find the rest somehow.

365
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,180
Where are you going to look for it, huh?

366
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,980
They don't even give us loans anymore.

367
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,520
So how much more do you need?

368
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,070
Another 30 million won.

369
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,150
Total?

370
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,650
No, you have to pay 30 million.

371
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,450
Where is Mi-Na's money?

372
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,620
Are you asking me to pay for the two of us?

373
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,120
Do you have savings?

374
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,000
Mom!

375
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,670
I wasn't saving them to pay for the apartment.

376
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,420
My job is far away, but I'm constantly commuting!

377
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,010
If you move to a nice place,

378
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,350
then life will get better, right?

379
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,470
Everyone will have their own room,

380
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,480
and when you get married, you can sell it

381
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,610
and collect the dowry. Isn't that wonderful?

382
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,280
Don't worry, when it's time,

383
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,780
I will calculate everything down to the last penny.

384
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,450
Mom.

385
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,450
Do you think housing prices will increase?

386
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,370
And when did I say anything about a wedding?

387
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,910
Why are you so selfish?

388
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,000
Then you will live and pay rent!

389
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,800
And I won't cook anymore! Pay, then eat!

390
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,140
Okay, okay.

391
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,270
Kye-Na?

392
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,480
Kye-Na?

393
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,900
Kye-Na?

394
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,820
Oh, sorry.

395
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,900
Hello, I'm Carol.

396
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,120
Can you show me your ID?

397
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,450
So.

398
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,870
Here you are.

399
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,630
Ok.

400
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,050
Let's talk about you.

401
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,800
What do you do for a living?

402
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,430
I am working in the IT department of a financial company.

403
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,890
Why did you choose that job?

404
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,650
I didn't choose, the company chose me.

405
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,780
I had to work to pay off my student loans.

406
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
Keen on rugby?

407
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,130
- Excuse me? - Do you like rugby?

408
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,130
So why do you want to go to New Zealand?

409
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,810
Because it's warm there.

410
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,060
I actually hate the cold winters in Korea.

411
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,480
What do you want to do there?

412
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,740
I want success.

413
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,370
Success brings happiness.

414
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,170
Welcome!

415
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,600
Got it!

416
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,380
I won't take it, eat slowly.

417
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,130
I was starving.

418
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,810
Tired?

419
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,790
Today was a busy day.

420
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,400
Kye-Na, what are your plans after work?

421
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,450
Hyung-Seo...

422
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,910
was the first person I met in New Zealand.

423
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,790
We dated for about two months,

424
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,790
until I quit the noodle shop.

425
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,550
When we first started dating,

426
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,220
I didn't understand how I could be interested in a younger guy.

427
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,300
But since then I've only ever come across younger ones.

428
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,970
I like you.

429
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,140
You too.

430
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,480
"What makes me so attractive to these young men?"

431
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,900
At first I had no idea.

432
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,910
And then I realized that Korean boys don't adapt well to life away from home.

433
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,160
Enough.

434
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,750
They needed someone they could lean on.

435
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,290
"That's how it is."

436
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,920
"They need a mother."

437
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,960
"I'm too old to be in New Zealand,"

438
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,300
I constantly thought about it.

439
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,010
The guest left a bottle of wine.

440
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,390
And I took it with me.

441
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,850
Why does everyone carry wine in their bags?

442
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Huh?

443
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,060
Never mind.

444
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,400
I know an idiot,

445
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,900
and he also carries wine like this.

446
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,570
But I'm not an idiot.

447
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,410
You've suddenly changed so much.

448
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,870
Will you strangle me to death?

449
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,620
Hey, what's that for?

450
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,420
Drink.

451
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Kye-Na.

452
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,360
Do you see it there?

453
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,480
What?

454
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,490
There.

455
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,780
Sky Tower.

456
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,330
Beautiful.

457
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,290
Are you happy?

458
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,010
Tell me, are you happy?

459
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,300
Raise your hand,

460
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,810
if you are "happy" to be here.

461
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,850
How about this?

462
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,190
Just admit that you are depressed.

463
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,480
- That's where it all starts. - Huh?

464
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,020
This woman

465
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,030
- came to our university. - I know, it's difficult.

466
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,280
- Really? - Yes.

467
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,580
Look, it's her.

468
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,540
I listened to her lecture.

469
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,540
"Gather happiness,"

470
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,500
"not money"?

471
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,380
The book says,

472
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,590
what is most important in life

473
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,350
is not money, but happiness.

474
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,850
What kind of nonsense is that?

475
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,690
We need to save money, not some kind of happiness.

476
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,070
Everyone says money isn't important,

477
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,400
and then they go and invest in some stocks.

478
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,610
Damn financial geniuses.

479
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,120
Exactly, Kye-Na.

480
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,790
Look at this.

481
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,590
"Compass of Hope."

482
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,670
I always wondered, who buys these...

483
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,920
Look.

484
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,430
Look carefully.

485
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,050
You see,

486
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,310
the tip of this arrow...

487
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,690
Shaking a little, huh?

488
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,440
They say it's a little wobbly,

489
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,440
to find

490
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,780
exact direction.

491
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,950
What is happiness for you

492
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,740
at this moment?

493
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,370
The happiness you want now,

494
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,790
not tomorrow, not next year, not in 10 years.

495
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
People always ask:

496
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,010
"Hey, where have you been?"

497
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,730
"Hey, have you been to Japan? Have you been to America?"

498
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,980
This question is "Where have you been?"

499
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,690
How do I put it in English?

500
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,440
It's all very simple.

501
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,980
Let's try it together!

502
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,190
"Have you ever been to..?"

503
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,570
"Have you ever been to..?"

504
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,360
"Have you ever been to..?"

505
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,240
"Have you ever been to..?"

506
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,620
Great. Easy, right?

507
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,040
It remains only to add

508
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,870
some place after "Have you ever been to."

509
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,830
You can put a country or something.

510
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,290
Whatever,

511
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,630
even the most famous landmark in China.

512
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,090
Kye-Na?

513
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
So what is this?

514
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,930
Kye-Na?

515
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,350
What is this? Guess what.

516
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,390
Kye-Na? Joo Kye-Na?

517
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,980
The Great Wall of China.

518
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,240
(The Great Wall of China)

519
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,650
I am late, am I not?

520
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,950
No, just in time.

521
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,950
Wait, do I look normal?

522
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,950
It's okay, let's go.

523
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,760
Not sure if it will taste good.

524
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,720
Treat yourself.

525
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,010
The food here is... so-so.

526
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Why? Isn't it delicious?

527
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,940
We should've gone to Mikoto in the Chaeongdam district, right?

528
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,610
Exactly!

529
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,940
No, Kye-Na doesn't like sashimi.

530
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,990
Really?

531
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,990
No, I love sashimi.

532
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,810
Do you want another drink?

533
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,850
Yes.

534
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,470
My parents aren't usually that weird

535
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,430
like today.

536
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,800
Don't worry.

537
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,430
They are happy because their son found a job.

538
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,520
I think they

539
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,190
intentionally did not ask anything,

540
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,520
so that you don't feel uncomfortable.

541
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,860
What's uncomfortable?

542
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,070
I told them about your situation, so...

543
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,780
What is my situation?

544
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,830
That I am poor?

545
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,120
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

546
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,460
Hey, my parents work a lot.

547
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,300
Don't worry about me, thank you.

548
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,550
No, no, you're not understanding everything again.

549
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,340
What did I not understand?

550
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,890
So I made it all up because of my insecurities?

551
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,140
Don't say that, you piece of shit.

552
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,570
What is it?

553
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,440
No, just...

554
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,240
Mom asked me to give it to you,

555
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,610
but I was afraid you wouldn't understand it.

556
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,950
What's there?

557
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,870
Mom told you to buy everything you need.

558
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,710
She's worried, so show some respect.

559
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,750
Are you crazy?

560
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,960
It's not money, it's a gift certificate.

561
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,460
She gave it to you as a gift, you know?

562
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,050
I have one too.

563
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,800
What's wrong with the certificate?

564
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,760
What is this damn charity?

565
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,680
Don't call it "damn charity."

566
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,350
Why are you making me look poor and unhappy?

567
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,440
We study at the same university!

568
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,780
If I had as much money as you,

569
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,990
I would have entered a much better university!

570
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,070
I'm better than your sister who went to graduate school,

571
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
because she couldn't find a job!

572
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,830
Damn, who studies preschool education in graduate school?

573
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,970
Kye-Na, don't be angry.

574
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,640
You know how often I think about you.

575
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,510
You don't even know

576
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,720
what I don't eat, octopus or sashimi!

577
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,560
Sorry, it's my fault.

578
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,390
Don't apologize to me.

579
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,240
Keep it to yourself.

580
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,410
Joo Kye-Na!

581
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,870
Where have you been? Why so late?

582
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,960
Aren't you going to sleep?

583
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,050
I'll have a glass and go to bed.

584
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,720
I would like a drink too...

585
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,750
Daughter, why are you so pretty today?

586
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,770
Kye-Na.

587
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,280
Live as you want.

588
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,780
Don't worry about mom and me.

589
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,260
Dad.

590
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,180
Can't we just live in a 60-meter apartment?

591
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,150
Ten,

592
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:18,940
nine, eight, seven, six,

593
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:23,780
five, four, three, two, one!

594
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,000
Happy New Year!

595
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,620
Happy New Year!

596
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,170
So the new year has come.

597
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,670
Yes, finally.

598
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,010
Hearing this bell, you realize,

599
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,260
that the new year has truly arrived.

600
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,850
"Dweji".

601
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,480
Yes, "dweji".

602
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,900
"Radio".

603
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,980
Can you repeat that?

604
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,610
- Radio. - "Radio".

605
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,530
Radio is radio.

606
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,610
- "Memie"? - Yes.

607
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,490
Well done.

608
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,830
- "Pujo..." - "Puo..."

609
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,410
- "Puoni." - Yes, yes.

610
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,330
"Puoni".

611
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,170
Ha-Jun, have you ever seen a real owl?

612
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,960
No, I've never seen it.

613
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,090
- In Korean. - "Opsoyo."

614
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,800
Did you hear anything?

615
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,510
No, we didn't hear.

616
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,350
Ha-Jun, didn't you hear?

617
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,310
No.

618
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,650
Didn't you feel the house shake?

619
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,050
Kye-Na, how long have you been here?

620
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,260
Almost three years.

621
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,720
Wow, it's been so long.

622
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,730
Time flies so fast.

623
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,150
How annoying.

624
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,950
There is nothing to do here at night.

625
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,410
Nothing at all.

626
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,750
I still can't get used to it.

627
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,720
This is the kitchen.

628
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,350
Cereal, milk and coffee

629
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,020
are included in the accommodation price.

630
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,520
- Okay. - The one who finishes eating,

631
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,440
can replenish supplies from the pantry.

632
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,730
Of course.

633
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,780
And this is your room.

634
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,990
The bed you will sleep on.

635
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,240
Of course.

636
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:18,960
You can put all your personal belongings in a locker.

637
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,420
They cannot be left in common areas.

638
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,420
- Okay. - Hold the key,

639
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,920
- always close the door when you leave. - Yes.

640
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,390
The rent is $800 per month, as promised.

641
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:37,310
The deposit is $1,200, so it will be $2,000 in the first month.

642
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,560
- Cash. - Yes, of course.

643
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,160
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

644
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,000
- Have a lovely day. - You too.

645
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,640
Kye-Na, wait.

646
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,600
So?

647
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,600
I don't like the way you're dressed.

648
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,730
This whole... situation doesn't fit with our brand.

649
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,190
Look at your shoes!

650
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,150
Our customers don't buy clothes from someone who wears Converses.

651
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,910
Ah, then...

652
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,990
And I don't like your outfit.

653
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,620
At least she has her own style, and it's quite practical.

654
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,750
This is what customers like.

655
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,290
Her shoes are much better than your heels.

656
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,170
Sorry, but I wasn't talking to you.

657
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,130
Moreover, this store is huge.

658
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,590
Heels will completely destroy our joints.

659
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,010
They are not part of the dress code.

660
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,230
Okay, that's enough.

661
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:12,030
She behaved incorrectly. You can't just stand there and be silent.

662
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,110
Thank you for helping.

663
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,910
No need to thank me.

664
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,160
I just pointed out that she crossed the line.

665
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,330
Fucking racist.

666
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,920
I am Kye-Na.

667
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,880
Ellie.

668
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,300
Where are you from, Ellie?

669
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,590
Where am I from? This is our land.

670
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,760
Stand up for yourself. Never be silent.

671
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,810
Is this some kind of Maori way of overcoming problems?

672
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,320
No, they do that everywhere.

673
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,400
Okay.

674
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,410
I just want to say one thing.

675
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,120
It's good to have a clear goal, but it's not a big deal,

676
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,080
if you don't have it.

677
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,460
No one is chasing you, so there's no need to run.

678
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,460
Think about it and calm down.

679
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,680
If you're still nervous, take the risk.

680
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,440
The riskier the adventure, the better.

681
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,490
You know what I was thinking,

682
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,080
when I got a job?

683
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,120
"The hardest part is behind us."

684
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,630
We didn't help you with your studies,

685
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,470
and I'm terribly sorry for that.

686
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,810
I am so proud of my daughter for...

687
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,560
that she didn't give up.

688
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,860
Now Ji-Myeong will find a job too...

689
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,110
Mom.

690
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,240
I know, it seems

691
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,700
that little has changed,

692
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,330
but everything is getting better little by little.

693
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,210
First we used briquettes, then a boiler,

694
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,540
and now, after three winters here,

695
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,090
we are finally moving into an apartment.

696
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,300
So...

697
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,050
Hold on a little longer, okay?

698
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,350
If you don't stop fighting,

699
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,810
then you will eventually get your reward.

700
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,310
That's life.

701
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,900
Mom.

702
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,700
I don't want to endure the pain now,

703
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,620
waiting for the reward that may come,

704
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,290
or may not.

705
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:57,290
Grandma suffered all her life until she died.

706
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,180
Have you never thought about it?

707
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:11,980
Have you ever wondered how you want to live?

708
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,020
Not for anyone's expectations, but for yourself.

709
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,950
How do I want to live?

710
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,740
I just want my family to be healthy and happy.

711
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,990
And I wish Ji-Myeong well.

712
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,500
He is a good guy because he grew up in a good environment.

713
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,510
You are made for each other, right?

714
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:48,010
This is not a reward that may or may not come.

715
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,510
Everything will definitely work out.

716
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,060
Marriage and children is not a reward.

717
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,940
Do you want to get rid of me quickly?

718
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,610
What are you saying?

719
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,410
No, I want my daughter to meet a nice guy,

720
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,790
give birth to a child and live happily ever after.

721
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,870
What's wrong with that?

722
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,790
Little scoundrel.

723
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,460
For me, this is the greatest happiness.

724
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,100
I want to be happy too.

725
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,490
Kye-Na.

726
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,910
What are you doing here?

727
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,290
This is my sister.

728
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,550
Hey.

729
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,390
Do you want a cigarette?

730
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,050
- Kye-Na! - Oh, you! You scared me!

731
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,760
Hello.

732
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,430
Have you eaten yet?

733
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,980
By the way, did I tell you?

734
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,810
I got a job as a cook's assistant

735
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,440
in an Italian restaurant.

736
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,060
- "Vivace"? - Yes.

737
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,360
And on the weekends I make coffee at Joyce's.

738
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,070
So that's why I don't see you at the academy.

739
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,120
So...

740
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,240
I'm thinking about quitting my studies.

741
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,330
Why?

742
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,700
Don't you have one semester left?

743
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,080
Yes, just one.

744
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,500
But I never dreamed

745
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,550
about, like, office work,

746
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,130
with a tie and all that.

747
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,840
No matter how much I study, I can't remember anything.

748
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,140
I guess I'm not made for studying.

749
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,680
When I start looking at the income statements,

750
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,390
I feel like I'm going crazy.

751
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,520
So what?

752
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,060
I will become a chef.

753
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,730
- Chef? - Yes.

754
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,690
I have always loved both cooking and eating.

755
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,360
What did they?

756
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:38,160
After 900 hours of training

757
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,950
and a year of practice, you can apply for permanent residence.

758
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,330
What do you think?

759
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,340
If you really want to do it, do it.

760
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,010
You've come this far.

761
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,220
Why go through this again,

762
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,470
doing something you don't want to do?

763
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,760
Thank you for your support, ma'am.

764
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,270
Don't call me ma'am!

765
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,310
But you're doing well.

766
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,690
You grab onto what you like.

767
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,770
When we first met, I thought you were a real idiot.

768
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,820
- W-who, me? - Yes.

769
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,530
What is this?

770
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,160
You were always drinking and coming late for class.

771
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,290
I remember looking at you,

772
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,540
and I thought you were definitely crazy.

773
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,750
That's it.

774
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,380
Hey, I wasn't late because I was drinking!

775
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,630
Why then?

776
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:38,180
He worked part-time cleaning buildings.

777
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,510
When I enrolled in the academy,

778
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,680
I was left with 200 bucks in my pocket!

779
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,100
And they pay well for cleaning.

780
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,980
So I was late because I was working like crazy.

781
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,360
And if I was late for the train...

782
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,610
Then there was no way I could get to that damn academy.

783
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,110
That's why I didn't go. Shit, I didn't think you thought that way...

784
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,740
Whoops, I'm late again.

785
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,040
I don't want to go...

786
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,580
Excuse me, I have to go.

787
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,630
- Of course. - Goodbye!

788
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,420
- I'll call. - Okay.

789
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:20,590
Have you ever seen a penguin?

790
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,600
No.

791
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,810
Have you seen one?

792
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,100
Yes.

793
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,940
Speak Korean.

794
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,150
Yes.

795
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,440
Saw it on the South Island.

796
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,290
Last year, when I went to the South Island with my parents.

797
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,290
They sailed three thousand kilometers from Antarctica to the South Island.

798
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,500
Really?

799
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,300
How many kilometers is it from here to Seoul?

800
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,090
Not sure.

801
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,470
Did you live in Seoul?

802
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:07,220
Yes.

803
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,890
What is your most memorable experience there?

804
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,060
My friends.

805
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:14,860
Friends?

806
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,780
Do you want to come back?

807
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,360
Don't know.

808
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,530
But dad definitely wants to.

809
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,330
Really?

810
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,620
And you?

811
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,460
I?

812
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,860
Are you still working?

813
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,570
No, I quit.

814
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,410
The coffee shop? Why?

815
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,580
Well, it's kind of boring there.

816
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,840
Do you want to go abroad with me?

817
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:19,710
Abroad?

818
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,170
Where is this all of a sudden?

819
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,760
To New Zealand.

820
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,760
To New Zealand?

821
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,560
Is this somewhere near the Netherlands?

822
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,850
Well...

823
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,110
It is further south.

824
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,570
It's much warmer there than here.

825
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,440
And the hourly rate is high.

826
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,610
You can work a part-time job and look for

827
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,820
something you like.

828
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,030
And you'll learn English.

829
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,540
Don't you want to?

830
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,710
I don't know.

831
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,380
What's in it for me with New Zealand?

832
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,340
I'm so afraid to speak English,

833
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,970
that when foreigners come into the store, I'm as silent as a fish.

834
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,340
And my boyfriend is here.

835
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:15,140
Right, but will Ji-Myeong go?

836
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,860
What do you think?

837
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,240
So cold.

838
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,720
Oh my God, stop it!

839
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,220
- Hold on. - Thank you.

840
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,850
I don't know much about nuclear weapons,

841
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:05,190
but would Trump pay attention to Kim Jong-Un if he didn't have it?

842
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,110
If North Korea has nuclear weapons,

843
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,280
aren't people in the South afraid?

844
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,660
Well...

845
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:19,830
This has been going on for so long, I don't think

846
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,960
that Koreans often think about this.

847
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,170
But it seems to me that maintaining UN sanctions

848
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,930
drives Kim Jong-un into a corner.

849
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,680
Is that how Koreans think?

850
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:38,270
Yes, what do you think?

851
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,560
It seems to me that Trump, on the contrary, wants to convince

852
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,400
Kim Jong-un should not give up his weapons.

853
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:47,780
Because it gives them a reason to attack.

854
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,660
That's American diplomacy for you.

855
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,040
Kye-Na, let's go.

856
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,210
Ellie! Why are you so late?

857
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,470
- Do you have your phone with you? - Yes.

858
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,430
But what are you going to do?

859
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,180
Film me.

860
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:22,730
I'll show you what it means to take risks.

861
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,480
Okay.

862
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:28,070
What if something goes wrong?

863
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:34,200
I won't die! And if I do, that's not bad either.

864
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,410
Start filming!

865
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,490
Okay.

866
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,640
Let's go!

867
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,100
Hello.

868
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,520
Hello...

869
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,030
You know, I would love

870
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,240
to go to Korea if I could.

871
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,150
Really?

872
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:56,820
Korea is a real hell.

873
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,080
Everyone calls it "Hell Korea."

874
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,750
Really? So I can go to hell?

875
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,210
How interesting!

876
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,260
Koreans work so hard that they tire themselves to death.

877
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,680
Yeah, Koreans don't work to live.

878
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,890
They live to work.

879
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,470
I knew a Korean man,

880
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,060
who had three part-time jobs. Can you believe it?

881
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:33,070
In my opinion, Koreans divide people into ranks and classes.

882
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,280
New Zealanders and Westerners at the top,

883
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,320
they are followed by the Japanese and Koreans, and at the bottom are the Chinese.

884
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,620
And at the very bottom are the people of Southeast Asia

885
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,910
But what about here?

886
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,410
You won't guess who's from where.

887
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,880
Because in their eyes we are all the same.

888
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,210
Asians are only divided into those who speak English and those who don't.

889
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,010
That's a bit judgmental.

890
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,890
The richest Asians who come here are

891
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,930
people from Southeast Asia.

892
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,390
People who came from Thailand or Vietnam,

893
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,940
They lived wonderfully in their own countries.

894
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:16,030
Sorry, but did most Japanese and Koreans come here

895
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,650
because of poverty?

896
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:23,580
If they were wealthy,

897
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:26,870
then we would go to the USA or Canada, right?

898
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,590
You're quite screwed up for someone who grew up in a wealthy family

899
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:34,960
without any worries.

900
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,340
I think you and I are the same.

901
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,140
Not everyone has rich parents like you.

902
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,850
Wait a minute.

903
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,970
Aren't you from a rich family?

904
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,350
Oh, I guess you can't hide poverty!

905
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,020
What about you?

906
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,900
Really? And I didn't know.

907
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,710
So?

908
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,340
Are you Ellie Roman?

909
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,510
No.

910
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,800
Did you shoot this video?

911
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,310
So.

912
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,850
Joo Kee-Ne?

913
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,520
Kye-Na.

914
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,980
Joo Kye-Na.

915
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:43,610
You are accused of illegally downloading videos,

916
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,450
illegal sublease and violation of the Housing Code.

917
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:52,080
I didn't know it was illegal. If I had known...

918
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,580
We are investigating here.

919
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:55,790
Just answer the questions.

920
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,420
Where is Ellie Roman now?

921
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,520
Let's go!

922
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,270
So this video cost you two thousand dollars?

923
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,820
This is not funny.

924
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,320
When is the next court?

925
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,450
On the 4th of next month.

926
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:29,410
If I am found guilty,

927
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,750
will have to pay a fine and return to Korea.

928
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,130
Even if found innocent,

929
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,300
records about the trial will be lost.

930
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:49,970
And this will significantly reduce my chances of getting a job and citizenship.

931
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,810
Does this have to be New Zealand?

932
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:03,690
Last week I went to visit my father in Jakarta.

933
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:09,070
He asked what I would do when I finished my studies.

934
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,580
So what? What will you do?

935
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,540
I will return to Indonesia.

936
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,090
I'll borrow some money from my father,

937
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,300
to start a trading business, such as importing auto parts.

938
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,720
Sounds great.

939
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,810
Do you want to come with me?

940
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,650
You will still be a foreigner,

941
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:41,110
be it New Zealand or Indonesia.

942
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:47,570
Aren't there more opportunities in Indonesia than here?

943
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:50,240
Don't you think?

944
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,410
I speak Indonesian, Javanese and English,

945
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,920
and you speak Korean and English.

946
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,590
Are you...

947
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,260
Are you making a business proposal? Or...

948
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,180
It's...

949
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:11,890
Both.

950
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:16,480
Come with me to Indonesia.

951
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,940
You know what's more dangerous

952
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,740
to jump with a parachute from an airplane

953
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,660
or from the roof of a building?

954
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,040
Falling from the roof of a building is much more dangerous.

955
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,790
- Is everything okay? - Damn it!

956
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,960
If you fall from a high place,

957
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,380
you have time to compose yourself

958
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:50,180
before you hit the ground,

959
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:55,010
but when falling from a low place, there will be no such luxury.

960
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:59,690
Hey, don't cry! Let's go, huh?

961
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,350
I can't get up.

962
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,570
Go without me.

963
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,740
Wait here, I'll take everything away, okay?

964
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,040
Where is the address? Address.

965
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,830
Next news.

966
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:21,290
Chae Bok-Hee, the famous preacher of happiness,

967
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:25,920
was found dead on a train bound for Busan.

968
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,340
Yesterday, around 4:00 PM, a cleaning crew

969
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:33,140
found Ms. Chae on the train at Busan Station and notified the police.

970
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,680
Chae Bok-Hee, author of the book "Collect Happiness, Not Money",

971
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,810
was scheduled to give a lecture in Busan on the day of her death.

972
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:41,980
Known as a writer and speaker,

973
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,310
Chae was a preacher of happiness,

974
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,360
which inspired and encouraged

975
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,650
many people

976
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,690
with her fruitful career.

977
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,570
Ms. Chae was reportedly battling terminal lung cancer,

978
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,160
and the police believe she died while traveling on the train,

979
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,490
but the exact cause of death and...

980
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,720
Kye-Na!

981
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,430
That's me!

982
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,260
How are you doing?

983
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,520
Hello, Mi-Na!

984
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,310
- Do you like the new apartment? - Of course!

985
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,020
It's amazing!

986
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,770
Is everything okay?

987
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:32,490
Huh? Call more often, we're dying of curiosity here!

988
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,030
Little scoundrel...

989
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,200
Sorry.

990
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,700
Are you all right?

991
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,290
How is dad doing?

992
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:43,210
- Dad! Dad! - Honey!

993
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,500
- Kye-Na is here! - Kye-Na!

994
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,750
- Kye-Na is calling! - Come here quickly.

995
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:47,290
- Huh? Kye-Na? - Kye-Na.

996
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,790
- Come faster. - Oh!

997
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,130
Look here.

998
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,840
Kye-Na!

999
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,930
We're doing great!

1000
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,470
Sorry, Dad.

1001
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,430
What are you apologizing for? Forget it!

1002
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,930
What's gotten into you?

1003
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,770
- What is it? - Mom!

1004
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,310
- Kye-Na! - Mom, don't go.

1005
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:06,730
She's fine too!

1006
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,440
- Oh, it's back. - No, no.

1007
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,650
Say, say.

1008
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:13,320
Don't worry about us, enjoy life!

1009
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,400
Dad and I...

1010
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:35,350

Manu, what is this?

1016
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:05,000
- Thanks, bro. - No.

1017
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,830
Now it's my turn.

1018
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,330
- What is this? - Hold it.

1019
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,880
Oh, Austin.

1020
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,300
I hate books...

1021
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,510
- I don't read at all! - He doesn't read!

1022
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,420
I won't read it!

1023
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:19,220
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1024
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,010
Cheers!

1026
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:38,030
How is culinary school? Do you not regret it?

1027
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,820
Yes, it's very interesting.

1028
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,950
Next time you want to eat, tell me.

1029
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,040
I'll cook anything.

1030
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,670
I'm going to have some more drinks, do you want to come with me?

1031
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,210
It won't work today.

1032
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,010
What about that Indian?

1033
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,390
He is Indonesian.

1034
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,850
- Yeah. - We broke up.

1035
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,690
Really?

1036
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,860
Yes.

1037
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,900
What about you?

1038
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,410
What about me?

1039
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,910
- What? - What?

1040
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:30,960
Is everything okay?

1041
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,220
Yes, not bad.

1042
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,220
But really?

1043
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,720
So what's up?

1044
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,050
Ha-Jun adored you.

1045
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,630
How unfortunate.

1046
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:23,260
I am also very sad.

1047
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,260
Thank you,

1048
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,560
for letting me work for you.

1049
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,180
Are you graduating already?

1050
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:35,690
- Yes. - My congratulations!

1051
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,650
I remember when we first met,

1052
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,530
you stood confused in the middle of the airport.

1053
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:49,120
I was so nervous then.

1054
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,330
During passport control

1055
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:55,000
I couldn't say what was in my suitcase,

1056
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,000
or the reason I came here.

1057
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,590
Poor soul.

1058
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,380
- Have you already decided what you're going to do? - Yes.

1059
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:08,390
I will pursue my degree to obtain citizenship.

1060
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,100
Good luck to you.

1061
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:15,560
Thank you.

1062
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,240
Dear.

1063
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,820
Dear?

1064
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,160
- Are you okay? - Huh?

1065
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:42,590
Hey guys.

1066
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,220
Even though I didn't get my degree for $80,000,

1067
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,340
Kye-Na did it!

1068
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,980
Wow, well done! You got that damn diploma!

1069
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,650
Everyone knows that Kye-Na studied accounting, right?

1070
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:02,690
What the hell is that?

1071
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,860
I don't know myself!

1072
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,450
Your mandu are ready.

1073
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:08,700
Ma'am, we didn't order mandu.

1074
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:11,870
I heard she got her diploma? Congratulations! It's on the house.

1075
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:16,620
Applause to the owner!

1076
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,580
Thank you, ma'am!

1077
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:22,960
How are you feeling? Are you happy to be in New Zealand?

1078
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,090
I'm not sure, but I feel damn great right now!

1079
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,180
Damn New Zealand!

1080
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,930
Damn New Zealand!

1081
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,010
Good evening everyone.

1082
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:20,770
We will begin today's report with news about a strong earthquake in the Tasman Sea.

1083
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:24,860
Today around 9:07 PM

1084
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:28,490
an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 10 km occurred.

1085
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:33,320
The National Emergency Management Agency has issued a tsunami warning for Auckland

1086
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:35,660
and ordered the inhabitants of the coastal areas

1087
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,410
evacuate to the nearest high ground.

1088
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,540
Our team is currently monitoring the situation and assessing the consequences of the earthquake.

1089
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,670
We will provide details as soon as we confirm everything.

1090
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:48,250
(Magnitude 6.3 earthquake strikes near Auckland)

1091
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:53,720
According to Auckland Police, an investigation has been launched

1092
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,640
upon the discovery of the bodies of the three deceased.

1093
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,640
According to officers, today at around 9:00 p.m.

1094
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,980
they received a message from residents that their neighbor was not getting through.

1095
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,270
The police responded to the call

1096
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:04,810
and found three bodies in the house.

1097
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,190
The victims were a man and a woman

1098
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:08,400
in their 40s and a little boy...

1099
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,840
Did you hear anything from Kyong-Woon recently?

1100
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,760
No, nothing.

1101
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,640
He said that he had passed the exam last year.

1102
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,310
It seems not.

1103
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,390
Really?

1104
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:48,520
Therefore, I think,

1105
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,610
he didn't contact anyone.

1106
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:57,450
Kye-Na, have you heard anything from Kyong-Woon?

1107
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,540
How would she? She went abroad.

1108
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:11,960
New Zealand, was it?

1109
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:26,550
(I made seaweed soup. Bring it to Dad at 5 o'clock)

1110
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,720
I have food here too,

1111
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,890
why did you bring this?

1112
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,850
I would cook myself something right now,

1113
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,100
and that would be fine.

1114
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:54,730
Dad, don't say that.

1115
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:58,450
And thank Mom more often.

1116
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:05,990
Your mother

1117
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:09,620
doesn't listen to me when I ask her

1118
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,120
to not pack a lunch.

1119
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:16,500
She complains that her back hurts all the time.

1120
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:23,220
How are you? Doesn't it hurt anywhere?

1121
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,430
No.

1122
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,770
Here I can move from time to time,

1123
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:30,190
but what about at home?

1124
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,610
Are you not drinking now?

1125
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,360
No, but I still have to drink to fall asleep.

1126
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:44,530
But you shouldn't drink that much.

1127
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,280
Okay.

1128
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:49,750
Do you feel better now?

1129
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:52,460
Yes, Mom's soup helped.

1130
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,380
No, anyway,

1131
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,340
why did you have to drink so much?

1132
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:10,730
Ji-Myeong had to carry you on his back.

1133
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:16,860
I'm sorry.

1134
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,380
Well, a pigsty, right?

1135
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,300
This is how I live.

1136
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,580
How is work?

1137
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,660
You really wanted to go there.

1138
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,130
Yes, I wanted to.

1139
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,470
How are you?

1140
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,930
How is life in New Zealand?

1141
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,560
Not bad.

1142
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,820
You can even live there working part-time.

1143
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:45,490
The salary of a journalist and a bus driver is almost the same.

1144
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,160
Seriously?

1145
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:59,330
Are you staying in Korea now? Or will you come back again?

1146
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,010
I don't know yet.

1147
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,260
I missed you so much.

1148
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,030
Can't you

1149
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,160
just stay with me?

1150
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:18,540
- Ji-Myeong. - Yes?

1151
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,670
Isn't it time for you to get up?

1152
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,880

Cheers!

1170
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:32,040
Thank you to our biggest fans.

1171
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,460
- You are great. - Thank you!

1172
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:37,130
It went well.

1173
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:41,800
So where is New Zealand? Next to the Netherlands?

1174
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:44,140
No, near Australia.

1175
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,260
So how is it?

1176
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:49,140
I'm planning to go abroad this year.

1177
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,440
- Really? Where? - Well...

1178
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,600
- Um... - This... Georgia.

1179
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,690
He is going to Georgia next month.

1180
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,690
The one in America?

1181
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:58,530
No, no, this is the country.

1182
01:32:58,610 --> 01:32:59,820
Well, this one, Georgia.

1183
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,860
- Georgia. - Georgia, yes.

1184
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,990
What are you going to do there, traitor?

1185
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:05,700
We need to fight here.

1186
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,700
- Fight for change! - Here he goes again.

1187
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:09,040
- For the sake of the homeland! - Oh my God...

1188
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,500
Fighting is pointless.

1189
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:15,290
I just want to go somewhere quiet with my guitar.

1190
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,920
Hey, you're a freak here,

1191
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,670
so who will need you there?

1192
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,880
Stop calling everyone freaks!

1193
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:23,720
I don't think we're the weird ones.

1194
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,510
- Madness is the new normal. - Yeah.

1195
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:28,560
Your music is the best I've ever heard.

1196
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,020
So am I also kind of crazy?

1197
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,350
You just love me so much.

1198
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,980
- Let's drink! - Let's drink!

1199
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:43,030
Kye-Na, stay for another hour.

1200
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:46,740
I'm very tired, so I'd better go.

1201
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,200
What are your plans?

1202
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,250
I'll stay with them. And Hong-Won is here too.

1203
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:53,040
It's still so early,

1204
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,170
come with us!

1205
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,000
She said she was tired.

1206
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,210
Kye-Na, don't worry. Can you go home alone?

1207
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,840
Yes, I'll manage somehow.

1208
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,340
I'm still hanging out. See you at home.

1209
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,680
Come inside!

1210
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,010
- See you at home! - Bye.

1211
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,470
- Be careful there. - Yeah, bye-bye.

1212
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,430
Goodbye.

1213
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:42,960
We had to wait so long.

1214
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:22,420
What is it?

1215
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,380
You...

1216
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,100
Eat with such pleasure.

1217
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:33,970
I...

1218
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,810
I was so hungry to eat something fatty.

1219
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,940
You know, the kind that makes you feel sick.

1220
01:35:58,710 --> 01:35:59,750
It's...

1221
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,420
really the last time.

1222
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,880
If it doesn't work, I'll try something else.

1223
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:13,050
There has to be

1224
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,640
work for me too, right?

1225
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:20,020
Of course, it has. Definitely.

1226
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:26,980
Lately, I've been thinking a lot

1227
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,990
about happiness and all that.

1228
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,070
I think,

1229
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:36,660
this word is overrated.

1230
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,790
It's enough for me if I'm fed and clothed.

1231
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:45,790
For me, this is true happiness.

1232
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:49,090
For me...

1233
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:58,640
If the air is clean

1234
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:03,650
and my room is sunlit, it's fine.

1235
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:08,110
That's all I need.

1236
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:15,410
After exams

1237
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:19,080
I want to go somewhere far away.

1238
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:28,800
How long have I been walking around with a gloomy face among people?

1239
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,840
I'm fed up with this.

1240
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:36,180
Where do you want to go?

1241
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,100
Just...

1242
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:41,600
to some nice place.

1243
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:43,890
It would be nice

1244
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:47,270
to just sit outside and look at the sky.

1245
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:51,650
Yeah.

1246
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,070
Do you think I can do it?

1247
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:01,120
Why not? Of course.

1248
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,500
- Do you think so? - Yes.

1249
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:11,630
But...

1250
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:14,260
Why are you so kind today?

1251
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:20,220
You're too gloomy.

1252
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:26,310
Can you bring more ketchup?

1253
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,360
Okay, wait here.

1254
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:36,220
Attention airport passengers...

1255
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:40,680
Once upon a time, there lived a penguin who hated the cold.

1256
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:42,930
And his name was Pablo.

1257
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:47,520
Pablo tried his best to get to a warm place,

1258
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,140
but constantly failed.

1259
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:51,480
But friends came to his aid

1260
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,110
every time.

1261
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:58,110
So Pablo didn't give up until the last moment.

1262
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:03,370
Eventually, he carved out all the ice around his igloo

1263
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:04,910
and made an ice ship.

1264
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:06,540
Sorry.

1265
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,250
That I won't be able to be there.

1266
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,210
Everything is fine.

1267
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:15,050
Don't worry about mom and dad. Just be happy.

1268
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:16,210
Do you hear me?

1269
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:19,340
Have a good trip.

1270
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,800
Go already.

1271
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,350
Stay healthy.

1272
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:28,680
At first everything was fine, but the ship slowly melted,

1273
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:32,730
leaving behind only small pieces of ice.

1274
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:37,900
However, Pablo was determined to sail on.

1275
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,620
He sailed aimlessly day and night,

1276
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:47,370
and eventually landed on a warm island similar to Hawaii.

1277
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:53,500
So he stretched a hammock among the palm trees,

1278
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:56,630
laid down, drank and said

1279
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,050
"I will never be cold again."

1280
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:24,070
Haven't you flown yet?

1281
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,530
Not yet.

1282
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:27,410
Finished work?

1283
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:28,790
Almost.

1284
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:30,910
Wait a minute.

Hey, what is it?

1291
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:55,900
Is this not an ordinary cake?

1292
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,860
And my birthday is next week!

1293
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:00,860
What are you doing? Blow faster.

1294
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:09,450
Congratulations on your thirtieth anniversary!

1295
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:12,330
Stop it!

1296
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,670
If you miss me, I will always wait for you.

1297
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:23,380
Stay healthy.

1298
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:26,050
You too.

1299
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:31,600
Goodbye.
