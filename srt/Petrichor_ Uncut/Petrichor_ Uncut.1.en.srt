3
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,280
Today, the Senate have approved the marriage equal bill,

4
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,480
making Thailand become the first country in the Southeast Asian region

5
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,520
to legalize same-sex marriage.

6
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
Code 40, report 203.

7
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,079
Fire engulfed a vehicle

8
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,480
on the outer ring road Kanchanapisek outbound.

9
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
One person is found dead.

10
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,280
No, no.

11
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,480
Though I dress to the nine,

12
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,400
today is my shift,

13
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm on call.

14
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,880
Let me ask you one thing,

15
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,960
If you keep working like this,

16
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,640
when am I going to meet your sweetheart?

17
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
Glad you brought that up.

18
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,079
Take your bouquet back

19
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,000
I’m not getting married. I’m not interested in romance, either.

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,160
I don't want to have more headache.

21
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,040
So, you gonna spend you entire life living in the hospital,

22
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,960
dissecting bodies?

23
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,880
Don't worry.

24
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,880
I'm gonna resign next month.

25
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,800
I'm tired of working with all the red tape,

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,320
Before they can make any move,

27
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,680
they always need to wait for their boss's order.

28
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
Super boring!

29
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,760
That mouth of yours!

30
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,760
You have lived this long, safe and sound

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,000
just be careful, one day the police will come at you!

32
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,320
Honestly, it’s a wonder you’ve survived in your field
without getting into trouble.

33
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Come on.

34
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,520
Everyone can just go their own way.

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,560
I can't do it anymore.

36
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
I think...

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,480
Just a sec.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
Yeah, I'll be right there.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,880
Sorry, duty calls.

40
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,120
Let's celebrate next time, okay?

41
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,960
Tul,

42
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,480
why did our boss order us to look at this case?

43
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,800
- Is there anything wrong?
- I'm curious too.

44
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,320
Inspector Tul,

45
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,320
you're the first team to get to the scene.

46
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,680
The boss ordered me to take this matter away from the local police,

47
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,280
for fear that they will overreact.

48
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Investigate it quickly and report back to me.

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
So I can talk with the boss.

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,520
Oh, and another thing,

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,240
I don't want this case to be on the news.

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,600
Can you keep this quiet, Inspector?

53
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,080
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,760
Look at your face, the commander just called, huh?

55
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,000
Why are the higher-ups so good at giving orders?

56
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't they freaking know how the people on the front line
actually do their jobs?

57
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
Look at this.

58
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,040
The son of Mr.Siraphob,

59
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
the biggest media mogul in Thailand.

60
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,600
That's why they don't want the local police to interfere.

61
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
Where's the forensics?

62
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,600
Why haven't they shown up yet!?

63
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,360
Go in and look around.

64
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Phu and Jiu, if you find anything suspicious,
take a pic of all of them.

65
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
But don't touch anything yet.

66
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,480
Copy that!

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,920
Please check

68
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,120
What does this perfume have to do with the deceased?

69
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
Why did it fall in the car?

70
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,080
And those cigarette ashes.

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
Keep them all away.

72
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,320
- Yes, madam.
- Thank you.

73
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Phu,

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
inform the family

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,320
and ask for all the information.

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
And don't forget to check

77
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,480
the incoming calls and outgoing calls

78
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,400
of the deceased

79
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
to see if there’s anything unusual?

80
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,120
Go.

81
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,680
Evidence has been collected.

82
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
How much longer do we have to wait, Inspector?

83
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
We have to wait until the forensic team show up.

84
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
We can't do anything with the body first anyway.

85
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,440
What are you doing?

86
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,880
Don't touch the body.

87
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,080
I haven't touched or moved the body before your team arrive.

88
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,840
But Doctor, your all dressed up like this

89
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,480
maybe the timing isn't quite right, huh?

90
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,840
If you're busy and gonna be late,

91
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,640
isn't it better to send other people who are more ready to work?

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
Beauty

93
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,440
has nothing to do with my ablity to work.

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Police Major

95
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
Tul Charnwimol

96
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,680
Special Investigation Team 3

97
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,280
You just moved here, right?

98
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm sorry to let you wait.

99
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,919
Forget it.

100
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,080
- Just help me watc--
- But if there were tons of doctors like cops,

101
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,559
then, there must be someone arriving at the scene before me.

102
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,080
No livor mortis.

103
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,560
Pack it up and send to the autopsy room.

104
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,200
Doctor, wait!

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,320
Keep an eye on this for me.

106
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,200
What have you got, Doctor?

107
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,280
Can you tell me the cause of death first?

108
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,520
Not yet.

109
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,640
Just anything, Doctor.

110
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,080
I work against the clock.

111
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,200
Inspector, you need time,

112
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,480
Lab results and autopsy report also take time too.

113
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Doctor.

114
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,520
Look at the names of the license plate holder, look at the old news.

115
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,200
You know that the dead is the kid of someone important.

116
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,440
Even if I don't rush you,

117
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,440
someone will anyway.

118
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,080
Inspector, instead of talking to me why don't you use your precious time

119
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,720
to investigate witnesses and check with CCTV footage?

120
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,800
The identity of the deceased can't be identified yet.

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,800
The body was burned, and the estimated time of death
is within the last two hours.

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
That's all I can give for today.

123
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,600
If you want more, you need to wait.

124
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,160
Whoa, whoa.

125
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,120
So fierce,  definitely your type, huh?

126
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,640
Why did you pick a fight with Doctor Run?

127
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,480
Is she someone you know?

128
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,760
She freaking knows how to get under people's skin.

129
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,840
She's a friend of an old friend.

130
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,840
Doctor Run is always like this.

131
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,480
Always frank and blunt.

132
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,720
You two gotta work together for this case for a long time

133
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,360
It's better to not get into fight with her.

134
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,560
I didn't want to pick a fight.

135
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,400
But it looks like you beloved doctor want to have a problem with me.

136
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
How about the case?

137
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,520
When look at the situation,

138
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,080
I think it might have been an accident,
because the deceased had smoked.

139
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,840
Still not sure.

140
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,960
But what we can assume is Wasan was
probably waiting for someone before the incident.

141
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,120
Otherwise, he wouldn't had smoked this much.

142
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,520
Look at how much he smoked, if he was't addicted to it,

143
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,040
then he must be under a lot of stress.

144
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,920
That's why we need to know who Wasan was waiting for.

145
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
Phu,

146
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,320
you go check all the street cameras around here.

147
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,640
You mean every streets?

148
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Yes!

149
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,280
There must be an explanation for this anyway.

150
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,920
Who was  Wasan waiting for?

151
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,240
Or why did he park his car at this place?

152
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,200
The body is in Pugilistic attitude.

153
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,520
The whole body is charred except the sole of feet.

154
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,080
And there's some kind fabric buried in the skin tissue.

155
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,880
Let's start the autopsy.

156
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Epidural hematoma.

157
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,880
Is it a heat artifact, Doctor?

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
It's definitely not heat hematoma.

159
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,880
But this case also has depressed skull fracture

160
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,360
and the brain contusion at the same location.

161
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,080
This looks like a static head injury.

162
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,280
That means he had been hit in the head before got burned, right, Doctor?

163
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,960
Let's go check the airways.

164
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,560
No soot found in vocal cord.

165
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,760
Probably died before the fire started.

166
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
Send the sample to the toxicology lab.

167
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,440
Yes, Doctor.

168
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,440
Go ahead and close it up.

169
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,480
Doctor!

170
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,760
What have you got?

171
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,880
Can you tell me anything?

172
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,760
Have you looked at all the other evidence?

173
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,440
I've looked at them all. Only your autopsy report left.

174
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,760
Just tell me what you got.

175
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,480
So I can come up with a conclusion today.

176
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,360
Actually,

177
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I can conclude something.

178
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,280
But I'm gonna have to wait for the lab results anyway.

179
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,520
Both murder and accident are all possible.

180
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,680
I think Inspector should wait and see the lab results.

181
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,280
Clear, straightforward. Everything done is one go.

182
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,240
Can't you say something first,  just a little, Doctor?

183
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,080
I'll call you every hour.

184
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,800
Are the police always like this?

185
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,880
What wrong with her!?

186
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,560
Anyway, I think it wasn't just an accident.

187
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,480
Imagine if you gonna kill yourself,

188
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,200
would you do it in such a difficult way?

189
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,560
Smoking while spraying perfume? That doesn't make any sense.

190
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
So you think it's a murder?

191
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,280
Absolutely!

192
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
But we

193
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,240
still haven't found the weapon at the scene yet.

194
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,880
We need someone to check again.

195
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
Especially the area approximately

196
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,880
5 kilometers around the scene.

197
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
in case of finding something useful.

198
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,680
Copy that.

199
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,520
And the CCTV footage you've asked,

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,880
I found a clip from the gas station

201
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,680
near the scene.

202
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,280
We can see Wasan's car from this clip.

203
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,200
But there's something

204
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,000
a little bit off.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,760
Why?

206
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,840
Wasan's car didn’t just pass by once—

207
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,720
it went back and forth multiple times.

208
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,880
The time stamp in the clip is around

209
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,520
11 p.m. I already checked in with the gas station staff,

210
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,640
they all remember this car

211
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,720
because the driver was a real jerk.

212
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,720
What was he doing around there?

213
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,680
It's not near his house.

214
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,280
It's the way to his girlfriend's house.

215
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,280
And from what I have gathered,

216
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,280
before Wasan died,

217
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,280
he went to a party with this group of friends.

218
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,840
The first one is Pokpong.

219
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
He is a national tennis player.

220
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,240
They met at a clubhouse.

221
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
This person is Techin.

222
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,800
He is the son of a famous politician.

223
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,080
They knew each other through their fathers' society.

224
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
This is Methee.

225
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,000
He's the only one who knows Wasan since high school.

226
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,960
The last one,

227
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,040
her name is Belle.

228
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,120
Wasan's girlfriend.

229
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,400
She doesn't have a job.

230
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,680
I looked up her social media account,

231
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,520
it looks like they had been dating for less than a year.

232
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,440
How was the party?

233
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,440
Just a typical party.

234
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,480
But I had a headache that day, so I excused myself.

235
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,840
Can you tell me,

236
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,280
why did Wasan end up at this kind of place?

237
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,280
Directly under the bridge,

238
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,079
everyone knows it's where kids deliver drugs.

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,680
Wasan went there often.

240
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,000
Does that mean Wasan was doing drugs?

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,560
Both booze and drugs. He did all that.

242
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,680
And whenever he drinks,

243
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,480
he changes to a different person.

244
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't want to say anything without evidence.

245
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,160
and I don't wanna get in trouble with Wasan's dad,

246
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,880
but all his friends know that Wasan had a history of domestic violence.

247
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,480
If I were Belle, I wouldn't put up with him either.

248
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,520
How was your relationship with Mr. Wasan?

249
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
Have you two ever get into a fight?

250
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,480
Any habits that Wasan liked to do with you

251
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,800
Did he have any habits that

252
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,480
like using violence?

253
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,960
No.

254
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,440
We love each other.

255
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,680
Or will it be Belle?

256
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,880
Everything makes sense.

257
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Both motive for killing,

258
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,960
and the location of the crime scene that's is not far from her house.

259
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,680
It's possible.

260
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,760
While we're waiting for the forensic report,

261
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,880
go do some digging for me.

262
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,440
After coming back home,

263
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,760
according to what she told us, where did she go?

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,480
Sure. Copy that.

265
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,000
Thanks.

266
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,840
Tul!

267
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,080
Hello!

268
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,640
Hello, Inspector Dansiam.

269
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
What's your business?

270
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,560
Just call me Dan.

271
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
I don't have any business.

272
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm just worried.

273
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,480
I see you're working with Wasan's case.

274
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,360
If there's anything I can help, just tell me.

275
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,280
Consider it as an advice from colleagues who've
stayed here longer than you.

276
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,280
Thank you, Inspector.

277
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,680
But it's my case.

278
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,480
I can handle it on my own.

279
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,840
Excuse me.

280
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,560
Just like you think,

281
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,080
I found very little Hemoglobin level.

282
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,680
Because the deceased was a smoker.

283
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,360
But this level is too little,

284
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
he definitely died before he can inhale any smoke.

285
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,480
Thank you for speeding up the results.

286
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
It's really chaotic.

287
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
If I don't speed up the results,

288
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,160
that inspector will come in and destroy my department for sure.

289
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,040
I saw her at the hospital early in the morning.

290
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,040
But come on!

291
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,760
It's been a long time since we last saw the police this hardworking!

292
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,680
Just help her!

293
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,280
It's annoying.

294
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,440
Don't know who she thinks she is.

295
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
The media's making a mess of this.

296
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,280
Look like it’ll affect SR News’ stock sale next week.

297
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,880
What are you talking about? SR News is selling stocks?

298
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,680
If the forensics report reads opposite of an accident,

299
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,480
it's going to be a disaster for sure!

300
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,480
Nothing but a big mess.

301
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,760
How much worse can it get?

302
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,360
Just wait and see,

303
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,640
Soon enough, they'll order us to overlook everything and close the case.

304
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,200
I can already tell, no one cares about the truth or
what really happened to the dead person.

305
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,200
They just go with the flow and follow orders from the top.

306
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,000
Any updates, Doctor?

307
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Today we should have a clearer picture, right?

308
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,920
So...

309
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,560
after almost 24 hours,

310
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,440
is there anything useful for the case yet?

311
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
The body was charred all over,

312
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
except for the feet.

313
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,200
There's a heat fracture in the skull,

314
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,000
but also fractures and  brain contusion

315
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,840
suggesting static head injury.

316
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,440
And toxicology screening

317
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,680
doesn't show any Benzos or alcohol.

318
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,120
We’re still checking for other sedatives.

319
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,080
There’s no soot under the vocal cords,

320
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,680
and the carboxy level is only 3%.

321
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,680
Can you put that in simple terms for me?

322
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,480
Because right now, what you said

323
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,480
sounds like an alien language. I don't understand.

324
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,400
I told you, the deceased didn’t inhale smoke.

325
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,640
Do you think someone who's committing suicide by
setting themselves on fire with the car

326
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,720
or someone who gets into an accident,

327
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
will you find anything like this?

328
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,000
So, you’re saying

329
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,600
Wasan had died before the fire even started?

330
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,480
The living may lie.

331
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,440
But the dead can never lie.

332
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,400
You might think this case is a suicide case.

333
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,880
Or just an ordinary accident.

334
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,480
- But I think...
- I though it was a homicide in the first place.

335
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
The reason I’ve been pushing for information from you

336
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,680
is to confirm what I already suspected.

337
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,480
I noticed another tire mark at the scene
that didn’t belong to Wasan's

338
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
Plus, the evidence

339
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,480
like cigarette butts that fell outside the car.

340
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,360
It looks like Wasan was probably waiting for someone.

341
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,360
Someone who was waiting to hurt him.

342
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't want to admit it.

343
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,560
But maybe the Inspector's instinct is right.

344
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,080
This is a homicide.

345
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,080
Not an accident.

346
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,840
Thank you so much, Doctor. It helps a lot.

347
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,000
Can you send over all the forensic documents?

348
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Commander sir,

349
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,040
I'm gonna investigate this case anyway,

350
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,680
because it's a homicide.

351
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,040
If we rush through criminal cases like this,

352
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,960
we could end up with serious consequences in the future.

353
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,680
The family doesn’t want us to dig further.

354
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
Dragging this out will just make things messier.
You know that, right?

355
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,360
But now the killer is still out there.

356
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm about to catch the killer.

357
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,680
Do you really think you’re the only good cop here?

358
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,760
You think if I don’t give in to Siraphob,

359
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,200
do you know how many of our people will suffer?

360
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,480
You know exactly how powerful he is,

361
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,920
Who he is backing.

362
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,080
Don’t pretend you don’t.

363
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,720
Whether you want to make a fuss and keep digging because of your sense of justice or just to show off, fine

364
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,400
But I’m not gonna risk the whole department just for you.

365
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
I know.

366
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,800
I’m fully aware that my stubbornness is
causing trouble for everyone.

367
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,280
But I’ll take three days to wrap up the details of this death,

368
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,280
Give me some time.

369
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,520
You have only three days.

370
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,440
That means you need to find the evidence to prove this was an accident, and you need to do it fast.

371
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,480
And that means you have three days to find evidence to conclude that this case was an accident.

372
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Yes, sir.

373
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,440
Mr. Methee,

374
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,080
your friend told me that the night before the party,

375
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,120
you got into a fight with Wasan, is that true?

376
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,400
Hey!

377
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,320
Why did you let Belle go home alone? It's already late.

378
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,040
What the hell’s your problem?

379
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,440
She came here by herself, she can leave by herself too!

380
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,680
What the hell, man? She’s your girlfriend.
You’re supposed to take care of her.

381
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,760
It’s late, and you just let her go home alone?

382
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Let me ask you real quick,

383
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,600
You don’t care about her at all, do you?

384
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,600
What's wrong with you, huh?

385
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,200
You like my girl, right?

386
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,560
If you're so worried about her,

387
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
just follow and fucking send her home!

388
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,080
You can’t even get her to like you,

389
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,880
so don’t come acting like a dog in the manger!

390
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,480
That's so pathetic. Damn it!

391
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
What the fuck is wrong with you?

392
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,440
Hey!

393
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,400
Calm down!

394
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,880
Damn!

395
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,360
Such a loser! Asshole!

396
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
I don't like what he did.

397
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,320
It's me.

398
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,440
I stopped them from fighting like a dog.

399
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,080
Wasan was probably so mad,

400
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,640
that he stomped out of the party.

401
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Did you use this perfume?

402
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,320
No.

403
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,520
But we found this perfume in Mr. Wasan's car.

404
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,680
Your boyfriend.

405
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,680
Wasan would never use this grade of perfume.

406
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,120
Wasan only used premium brands from head to toe.

407
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,320
The perfume in the car is more likely someone else's.

408
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,800
Mr. Pokpong,

409
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,520
You think among your group of friends,

410
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,400
who seems to be most angry with Wasan?

411
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Uh, uh,

412
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,920
I don't know if anyone have told you about this yet.

413
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,400
Methee had a huge crush on Belle before.

414
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,840
He was trying to win her over before she started dating Wasan,

415
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
but in the end, he didn’t succeed.

416
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,200
Wasan got her.

417
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,680
Honestly, though, that was a while ago.

418
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,800
I think Methee’s moved on by now.

419
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,320
So, with all this,
it looks like Methee has the strongest motive, right?

420
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,520
I mean, they argued at the party,

421
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,120
and he has that grudge about Belle, the one he liked, being taken.

422
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,920
We can probably rule out Belle since she has a strong alibi,

423
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,280
there’s even a CCTV footage showing her picking up
food outside her house.

424
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,600
Yeah, Methee’s the only one without an alibi
during the time of Wasan's death.

425
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,120
Then should we detain Methee?

426
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,440
We can't do that.

427
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,360
We need to find the weapon that killed Wason

428
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
before being set on fire.

429
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,080
Withou the weapon,

430
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,040
we can't catch Methee.

431
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,920
You and Phu, go check

432
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,520
his phone records, both incoming and outgoing calls during that time.

433
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,880
In case we can get anything from identifying phone signal.

434
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,120
We might know the exact location of where Methee is.

435
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,080
Copy that!

436
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Inspector Tul.

437
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Yes, Commander.

438
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,840
You called the deceased's friend for further questioning, huh?

439
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,760
Yes, sir.

440
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,560
I found something suspicious.

441
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,440
But didn’t I instruct you

442
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,040
to wrap this case up as an accident?

443
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,400
So why are you still running around interviewing witnesses?

444
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,440
But the evidence suggests

445
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,920
that this isn’t just an accident.

446
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,320
How am I supposed to conclude that?

447
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,920
so who’s the superior here, you or me?

448
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,760
Commander, sir.

449
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,040
Don’t think that being promoted to Inspector so young

450
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,600
means you can do whatever you want and
don't care about your superior's order

451
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,320
I didn't mean that.

452
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,520
But if I wrap up the case and

453
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,840
just let that killer walk free like that,

454
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,520
isn't it worse?

455
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,400
If you can't do this, then I'll let someone else do it instead.

456
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Dan, team 2 will handle this case from now.

457
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,880
And I expect you to wrap it up quickly.

458
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,920
Yes, sir!

459
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,160
Hey!

460
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,920
You can’t just barge into my office like that!

461
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,760
I just finished questioning the deceased’s friends.

462
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,480
One of them seems to have a strong motive to be the killer,

463
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,200
and on top of that, there’s no alibi for him
at the time of the incident.

464
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,160
Good for you.

465
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,920
Why are you telling me?

466
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,800
The problem is, we haven't found the weapon that killed the deceased yet,

467
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,360
Other than the skull fracture from the heat,

468
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,680
you didn’t find anything, did you?

469
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,080
With the body all burned like that,

470
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,560
any traces left would have been destroyed.

471
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,680
What if we examine the body again?

472
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,120
I already checked thoroughly the first time.

473
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,240
I don't understand,

474
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,920
why you are still digging into this case.

475
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Didn’t your boss and Mr. Siraphob already agree to announce it as an accident?

476
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,520
I can't do that.

477
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,440
It's obvious that it's not an accident.

478
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,000
The dead can't speak the truth,

479
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,600
so we have to speak for them instead.

480
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,200
Actually,

481
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,320
I already wrote in the autopsy report.

482
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
but you might have missed it,

483
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,720
or maybe,

484
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,000
my language was too difficult for you.

485
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,920
What did you write?

486
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,440
Although most of the victim’s body was burnt,

487
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,400
I found some fibers clinging to his torso.

488
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,320
The fibers seem to come from felt.

489
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,720
There weren’t many,

490
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,560
but I had them analyzed, and that’s definitely the kind of material I told you.

491
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,280
Fibers like these

492
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,320
are often found in sports equipment.

493
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,720
This is the first one.

494
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,920
His name is Pokpong.

495
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,360
He is a national tennis player.

496
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,880
They met at a club house.

497
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,840
You are amazing!

498
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's  go!

499
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Where are we going?

500
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
To find more evidence.

501
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,880
I'm not going.

502
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,160
I’m actually about to submit my resignation.

503
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,880
You better wait for the new forensic doctor, and then you can go find evidence together.

504
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,760
Resign? You?

505
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,320
Yeah.

506
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,200
Consider those details I told you as the final task we’ll do together.

507
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,800
You! What!

508
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,320
What the hell are you doing?

509
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,520
You can’t resign now!

510
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,560
That’s nonsense.

511
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,560
Your job isn’t finished yet.

512
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,560
You have to stay and help me find the truth.

513
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,360
Let's go!

514
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,200
Go!

515
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,560
Wait!

516
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,080
Why are you suddenly rushing out like this?

517
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,320
Wait a sec, Doc.

518
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,400
How is it, Phu?

519
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,120
Did you find anything?

520
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,440
We've found the evidence.

521
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,240
It’s a tennis racket that was tossed into the roadside brush,

522
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,560
about 4 kilometers from the crime scene.

523
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,040
There’s blood on it, too.

524
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,200
That's great! This will nail him for sure.

525
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,880
Tul, another thing

526
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,640
I think we need to hurry up.

527
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,280
I heard that

528
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,560
the commander has started contacting the media

529
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,240
to make an announcement about Wasan’s death.

530
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,960
Okay.

531
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,360
Go, Doctor.

532
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,000
Hold on! Mr. Pokpong.

533
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,080
I’m going to need you to come in for further questioning.

534
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,640
I don't have time to play with you guys.

535
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,240
I need to hurry up for a tennis game.

536
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,880
I’m inviting you to come in for questioning at the
Investigation Department,

537
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,040
as well as to examine all your tennis rackets.

538
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,320
Hey, let go of me! Let me go!

539
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,120
If I'm innocent

540
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,760
but can't get to the game in time,

541
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,600
You'll all be paying for this!

542
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,000
You’re not the only one taking your job seriously.

543
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,960
I'm committed to mine too.

544
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,679
If you’re truly innocent,

545
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,800
I can’t do anything to you.

546
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,920
But if you’re unwilling to cooperate like this,

547
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,120
I think it looks suspicious.

548
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,679
Bring him in.

549
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Hey! Hey!

550
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,400
What the fuck? Let me go!

551
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,720
In the case of the tragedy that occurred to Mr. Wasan,

552
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:07,080
the police are considering that it was an accident
caused by his own negligence

553
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,520
The reason that the police are rushing to wrap up the case like this

554
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,040
by fears that Mr. Wasan’s news could negatively impact
SR NEWS’s IPO launch?

555
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Uh, uh...

556
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,120
- The public deserve the answers on this.
- Are these two things related? Please answer.

557
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,040
Has Mr. Siraphob personally requested
any assistance in this case?

558
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,600
I have no knowleadge about this IPO matter,
so I couldn't answer.

559
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,920
Let’s avoid linking up unneccessary rumors.

560
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,520
Mr. Siraphob

561
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,440
has just lost his son.

562
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,840
Uh, and defenitely want to seek for the truth.

563
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,720
But I think this is what the public wan--

564
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,240
Hey!

565
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,400
This is the press's right!

566
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,360
While we are waiting for more information,

567
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,520
may everyone be confident in the police's honesty.

568
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,680
Now the police continue to search for the truth

569
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,480
by using our best resources

570
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,040
and personnel to handle this case with integrity.

571
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,520
Here it is.

572
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,320
Hello, everyone.

573
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,320
I, Police Major Tul Charnwimol,

574
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,920
Investigation Inspector of Special Investigations Team 3,

575
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
have new information to report.

576
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Based on solid evidence and witnesses's accounts,

577
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,880
Mr. Wasan’s case is not an accident,

578
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,600
but a murder case.

579
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,720
Really?

580
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,600
Be sure of your own words, Inspector.

581
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
Commander, sir.

582
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
We just found a solid evidence.

583
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,360
We've found a tennis racket

584
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,200
near the scene.

585
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,520
It looks like the racket in your Instagram.

586
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,760
Can you answer me, Mr. Pokpong?

587
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,720
How did your racket end up near the crime scene?

588
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,600
Don't try to push me.

589
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,920
It's just a racket with a blood stain.

590
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
Who knows if the blood there is real or not.

591
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,480
The tire marks at the scene

592
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,160
also match the tires of you car.

593
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,720
Am I the only one in this country with that car model?

594
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,760
Or are you just trying to frame me?

595
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,120
Let me go now.

596
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,520
You have no right to detain me here.

597
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,840
I think you better wait to hear the results first,

598
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,640
Mr. Pokpong.

599
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
The DNA test.

600
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,280
We found Mr. Wasan’s DNA on the handle of the racket.

601
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,120
And that's not all,

602
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,440
I managed to retrieve data from the victim’s phone.

603
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,480
It shows that just before the incident,

604
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,200
he made several calls to you, Mr. Pokpong,

605
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,840
and even sent messages arranging to meet.

606
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,320
I believe we have sufficient evidence now

607
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,400
to arrest you for the murder of Mr. Wasan.

608
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,440
Taking forever for you to come, huh? You jerk!

609
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,560
Making me wait all day for you.

610
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,000
How much did you bring this time?

611
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,760
Before I give you anything,

612
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,920
I have something to ask you.

613
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,640
What the hell do you want to talk about?

614
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,760
I don't want to talk to you.

615
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,240
I’m here for the stuff.

616
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,440
It's about my sister.

617
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,480
Why do you keeo talking about the past?

618
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,320
Your sister’s crazy, and it has nothing to do with me.

619
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,560
How the hell is it not your fault?

620
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,040
If you hadn’t fool her to love you,

621
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,840
she wouldn’t be in a madhouse right now!

622
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,360
Wait a minute.

623
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,280
You sister is crazy.

624
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,920
I haven't done anything.

625
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,600
She’s the one who keeps following me around.

626
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,280
And another thing,

627
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,600
maybe you should teach her to really know her place.

628
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,200
Then why did you beat her up?

629
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,640
Damn it.

630
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,120
Why the fuck you keep talking about it?

631
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,920
Didn't my father pay you?

632
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,160
What the hell do you want from me?

633
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,800
You want to blackmail me?

634
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,720
Or you need money?

635
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,120
How much do you want? Just fucking say it!

636
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,720
I'm sorry.

637
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,480
I'm so sorry.

638
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,720
That fucking asshole who loves using violence

639
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,920
and always look down on others

640
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,200
deserve much worse than this.

641
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,880
Mr. Pokpong Siriliaowanich,

642
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,800
a close friend of the deceased,

643
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,960
is the murderer.

644
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,920
The motive is personal revenge.

645
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,000
The deceased had previously assaulted the killer’s sister.

646
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,120
For further details,

647
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,760
Commander Pichet will continue the interview.

648
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,120
Yes, yes.

649
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,840
As I've mentioned,

650
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,200
the police have committed all best resources and personnels

651
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,520
in persuit of the truth.

652
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,080
Now the truth has indeed been revealed.

653
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,680
Thank you.

654
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
Wow, Inspector Tul is really something!

655
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,520
I believe you now that she isn't like anyone else.

656
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,520
That's so brave of her.

657
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,320
She is practically putting her neck on the line.

658
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,120
Yeah, definitely.

659
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,360
It’s like walking into a death trap.

660
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,600
I really admire her, seriously.

661
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,520
Going so far as to humiliate her own boss in public,

662
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,120
I'm sure there will be no place for her in the future.

663
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,400
Congratulations on closing the case, Inspector, but you better be careful.

664
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,640
- Congratulations on closing the case, Inspector, but you better be careful.
- Thanks.

665
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,760
You just came back, don’t lie down yet.

666
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,400
Get up and have something to eat first.

667
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,640
Well, I'm so tired.

668
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,840
Nah, you don’t need to pick up after me, Tin.

669
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,000
It’ll just get messy again.

670
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,560
It won’t, if you stop making it messy.

671
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,120
Now that's the hardest part.

672
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,880
If something’s out of place, you gotta tidy it up, right?

673
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,520
- It's nothing.
- Look! Just like this one.

674
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,320
This piece of trash,

675
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,520
it needs to go.

676
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,320
Keep it in place.

677
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,960
Roger that. Mr. Commander of cleanliness.

678
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,160
Well, that's great.

679
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,840
I’m so lucky to have you.

680
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,840
You’ve made my life 50% easier.

681
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,280
And the other 50%?

682
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:05,240
This little troublemaker right here, Nong Hed,
If I didn’t have her, I’d be 100% chill and at ease.

683
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,240
Haven't I told you already?

684
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,520
Look!

685
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,920
I saw that.

686
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,000
Put it in place!

687
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,120
I'm just teasing you.

688
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,040
But Hed,

689
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,200
What kind of cat is this, huh? So hard to please.

690
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,280
You won't eat this, you won't eat that.

691
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,360
I feed her every day,

692
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,000
and she still won’t let me hold her.

693
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,320
Aw, just give her time.

694
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,320
Maybe someone hurt her before,

695
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,120
which is why she doesn't trust many people.

696
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,720
After a while, she would be better.

697
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,560
Um,

698
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,520
I hope so.

699
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,800
Anyway,

700
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,800
I heard you did something big today.

701
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,080
That’s amazing, my girl.

702
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,160
You saw it too?

703
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,000
Sure! It's all over the news.

704
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,840
But no idea whether I'll be fired or not.

705
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,240
Why? You were threatened?

706
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,880
Not yet,

707
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,680
but it's not hard to guess.

708
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,480
I don't care about those who love to kiss their boss' ass anyway.

709
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,080
Tin,

710
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,520
I think if I keep performing up to standard like this,

711
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,160
I might consider applying for a transfer to the Crime Suppression Division.

712
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,120
Crime Suppression?

713
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,520
That's good.

714
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,280
But why? Isn't the special investigation something you enjoy?

715
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,720
It's good.

716
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,960
But I want to work on bigger cases,
ones that take me all over the country.

717
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,240
Just don’t go overboard.

718
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,920
If you get hurt,

719
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,400
I’m the one who has to take care of you.

720
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,720
Well, that's it.

721
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,440
That's why I'm not worried about anything.

722
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,680
With you around, Tin, I’ll be totally fine.

723
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,320
Um,

724
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,720
Do whatever you want.

725
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,120
Just be careful.

726
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,880
Like today,

727
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,320
embarrassing your boss like that.
Is that really a good idea?

728
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,080
Don't worry.

729
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,720
I can handle it.

730
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,960
Just trust you sister, okay?

731
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,440
She is a beauty with brain.

732
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,720
I know you're good.

733
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,520
You better be good at tidy up you mess as well.

734
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,440
Well, I haven't finished eating yet. Who said I'm done?

735
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,240
Hurry?

736
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,360
You little rascal!

737
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,160
I'm getting fat from eating all these snacks!

738
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,840
Do you have any idea,

739
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,880
how many times I had to go and apologize to Mr. Siraphob?

740
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,400
You know he’s a major donor to the party I’m running for.

741
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,680
By doing this, you’ve outright disrespected me.

742
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,400
My apologies, sir. I've thought that errors will occur.

743
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,080
Well, it’s a good thing

744
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,080
the press haven't caught on yet.

745
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,920
They think it’s just a minor quarrel between friends.

746
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,520
If they find out about Siraphob's son’s assault issue

747
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,760
and start digging into it,

748
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,320
it’ll be a huge problem.

749
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,560
I assure you, sir, that

750
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,640
from now on, I won’t let anything jeopardize your retirement.

751
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,880
That's good to hear.

752
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,520
You’ve been my right-hand man for a long time, Pichet.

753
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,520
The last job you have to do for me is

754
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,920
to do whatever it takes

755
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,920
so I can step down with a clean reputation.

756
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,480
If you still can't make your subordinates follow your order,

757
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,720
how can you replace me in the future?

758
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,280
I'll be more careful next time, sir.

759
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,720
If things escalate,

760
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,800
I’ll just transfer her to another department.

761
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,240
No need to go that far.

762
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,000
You can go now.

763
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,000
Is there something you need? The case is already closed

764
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,680
I'm here to thank you.

765
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,920
No need for that.

766
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,840
It's my job anyway.

767
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,240
Well,

768
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,760
you play a crucial role in helping me solve this case.

769
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,320
I really have to thank you.

770
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,240
Is that all?

771
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,040
If so, please go.

772
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,320
Wait!

773
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,240
I mean, I want to know if you still want to quit your job or not?

774
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,080
Don't quit, please.

775
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,640
Trust me.

776
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:10,320
I think one mad dog  tore up my resignation letter.

777
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,600
I’m too lazy to write another one,

778
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,560
so I guess I’ll stay for a while.

779
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,520
That's perfect! Doctor.

780
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,160
How about having dinner this evening?

781
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,720
No. Thank you.

782
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,760
Hey, why so quick to turn me down?

783
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,160
I don’t see any reason to go.

784
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,360
Well,

785
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,200
I want to treat you as a thank-you for helping me close the case.

786
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,520
Plus, we’ll be working together for a while.

787
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,520
Might as well get to know each other.

788
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,120
I think you and me,

789
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,760
we know each other just fine at work.

790
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,520
That’s not enough.

791
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,400
I mean, I understand why you don't like cops that
you've worked with in the past.

792
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,440
but I’m being completely sincere here.

793
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,400
Can’t you give me a chance to be a real colleague?

794
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,280
If you don’t want to go with just me, you can bring May along.

795
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,960
Please.

796
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,480
Let's go

797
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,760
It's all on me.

798
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,360
If you're quiet like this,

799
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,120
I'll take it as yes.

800
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:39,960
Run!

801
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,560
Tiwa.

802
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,760
Oh, sorry! Didn’t know you had company.

803
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,880
It’s fine,

804
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,800
she's  leaving.

805
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,720
Oh.

806
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,320
Thought we are going for a dinner.

807
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,400
You said it yourself.

808
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,560
Inspector Tul, right?

809
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,600
How do you know me?

810
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,760
The inspector who dared to stand up to her own boss?

811
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,800
How couldn't I know?

812
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,120
But what I still don't know is

813
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,600
who do you work for?

814
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,520
I’m Tiwa, by the way, a journalist.

815
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,320
It's nice to know each other.

816
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,240
I'm an Inspector at the Special Investigation Department.

817
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,120
I work for the state,

818
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,760
not for anyone in particular, if that’s what you mean.

819
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,840
Really? Not anyone’s lackey?

820
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,840
Getting promoted to this rank

821
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,080
so fast at your age,

822
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,880
that's impressive.

823
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,440
Guess so.

824
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,320
I’ve had a good track record, so promotions come with it.

825
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,400
Isn't it normal in the working world?

826
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,920
I think you better go back, Inspector.

827
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,320
Okay.

828
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,560
So...

829
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,320
see you in the evening, Doctor.

830
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,800
I'll wait.

831
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,480
Whoa.

832
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,040
My Jew! You look extra pretty today,

833
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,040
You’re getting this worked up just for a dinner with a girl?

834
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,400
If it were just a regular dinner,

835
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,520
I wouldn’t be excited.

836
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,320
But it’s May we’re talking about!

837
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,320
Didnt you two already know each other?

838
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,360
Don’t act like you’ve never done this before.

839
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,120
We haven’t talked in five years.

840
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,000
How could I not be nervous?

841
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,560
And why did you come up with the idea to
invite Dr. Run and May for dinner?

842
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,000
And also why did Tul agree with this idea, huh?

843
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,000
Well, that's right.

844
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,720
Hey, you should follow her as well.

845
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,400
She's just getting the ball rolling.

846
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,320
If you keep hesitating like this,

847
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,960
you’re never gonna win over Dr. May.

848
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,920
Here you go!

849
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,880
Thanks, but no thanks.

850
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,120
And how many times do I have to tell you?

851
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,720
May’s a scientist,

852
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,080
not a doctor.

853
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,920
Nah, close enough!

854
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,080
In my dictionary, she works in a hospital, so I'll just call her doctor.

855
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,520
Ow!

856
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,160
Tul, can’t you just go alone?

857
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,680
Jew, don’t chicken out!

858
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,000
Just hurry up already.

859
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,400
Look good already. Go.

860
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,280
Yeah, yeah.

861
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,120
why does it have to rain now?

862
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,400
It was so hot all day!

863
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,440
Yeah.

864
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,400
Jew, answer the call for me.

865
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,920
Hello, Commander.

866
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,080
Inspector Tul is driving.

867
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,040
Understood.

868
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
We’ll head there right away.

869
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,520
Look like we’re not having dinner with the doctors tonight.

870
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,440
There’s been a murder,

871
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,840
and Commander Pichet wants our team to check out the scene right now.

872
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,120
Run,

873
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,720
I think we’ll have to change the meeting place
with the inspector and lieutenant.

874
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,320
Why?

875
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,160
The restaurant is right there.

876
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,480
Why change plans now?

877
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,720
There’s been a murder case.

878
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,440
The two of us have to go too.

879
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,240
Sorry that you have to come here instead.

880
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,280
You’re dressed up nicely again.

881
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,040
Thank you.

882
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,080
But beautiful people

883
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,120
look good in anything.

884
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,120
The garbage man found the body.

885
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,920
about 20 minutes ago.

886
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,720
There’s no bag nearby,

887
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,520
and there are no tattoos or marks to identify her.

888
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,320
We’ll probably need to use DNA to identify her.

889
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,920
What do you think?

890
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,800
Doctor.

891
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:02,920
Hey!

892
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,800
Run!

893
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,360
Are you okay?

894
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,800
Run!

895
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,200
Hey, you!

896
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,640
If you're not feeling good,

897
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,640
you can go back to rest.

898
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,000
This case is...

899
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,520
like a serial murder case from 18 years ago.

900
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,120
From all of the evidences, Wisut is the most suspect.

901
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,880
Ploypapat Case seems similar to the case from 18 years ago

902
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,960
but the method is different.

903
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,040
Now cops like you guys are targeting only at one person

904
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:56,280
but it's possible to be someone who close to us, not Wisut.

905
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,760
But maybe there's someone looking for a loophole from this.
