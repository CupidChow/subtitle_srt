3
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,479
Do you think Ploypapas's case

4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,280
is it possible that Wisut isn't guilty.

5
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,040
Well, why would you think that?

6
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,000
Police ike you are targeting at only one person.

7
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,520
But maybe it's someone close to the victim.

8
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,240
Maybe it's not Wisut.

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,520
Maybe there's someone looking for a loophole from this.

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,840
Just like Yardpirun's father.

11
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,640
I want to know more about Ploypapas' works.

12
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
Has she ever told you about her problems at work?

13
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,480
She usually didn't talk much about work.

14
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,840
Well,

15
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
how about her close friends at work?

16
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,200
Did she have any?

17
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,280
There were some.

18
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,000
Mostly women.

19
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
They are Por and Nuch.

20
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,000
They often went out together on the weekend.

21
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,440
What about her boyfriend?

22
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,440
No. She didn't have one.

23
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,960
Someone from the bank sent the flower here, when Ploy had COVID.

24
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,079
Hello, Tul.

25
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,000
Tomorrow morning at 9,

26
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,040
You and Phu meet me at the bank where Ploypapas worked.

27
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Huh? What Ploy?

28
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,240
Didn’t you get ordered to drop this case?

29
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,240
Yeah.

30
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,120
9 o’clock. Don’t be late.

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,600
Wait!

32
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,120
Excuse me,

33
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
where is the patient from this room?

34
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,440
The doctor just discharged her this morning.

35
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,880
What are you looking at?

36
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,440
Don't you have anything to do?

37
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm just looking at you.

38
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,240
I'm worried.

39
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,640
You're overworking youself.

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
You should take a day off. Your dad won’t scold you for it.

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm fine.

42
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
You’re so in love with your work that at the end you couldn't quit.

43
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,840
But seriously, you need to rest.

44
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,040
Got it?

45
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,440
Give it to me.

46
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,000
No.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Give it back!

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,960
No!

49
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
The police can wait.

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
Why are you so worked up?

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,680
They need the results by tomorrow.

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,840
I have to finish them tonight.

53
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,520
Hey.

54
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,280
Why didn't you tell me that you've been dischaged?

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,840
Do I have to report to you everything?

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,640
You should have told me.

57
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
Last night, we were together all night , Doctor.

58
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,880
I even bought something for you.

59
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,640
Are you feeling better?

60
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,720
If I weren’t, my doctor wouldn’t have let me go home.

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Don't worry.

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
That's good.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,400
So...

64
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,440
I'll leave these for both of you.

65
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,320
Hmm. Thank you, Inspector.

66
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,280
Are you always this nice to everyone,

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,440
or just certain quiet, feisty one

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,000
around here?

69
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,880
I’m glad you’re better now, Doctor.

70
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
Thanks for helping me close the case,

71
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,520
but honestly,

72
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,640
you overstepped a bit that time.

73
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,240
Thank you for the snack.

74
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,000
You can leave now.

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm leaving.

76
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
Hm?

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,880
The reason you didn't quit,

78
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,080
it's not just about work anymore, right?

79
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,480
Is it because of this person too?

80
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,880
Mind your own business!

81
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Then let me have all of these, okay?

82
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Go to work. Go!

83
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,840
How close are you to Ploypapas?

84
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,920
Well, we started working here around the same time,

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,159
so we got close pretty fast.

86
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,440
Actually, Ploy wasn't very close to anyone except me and Por,

87
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,480
just like what you saw in the picture.

88
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,120
Before Ploy's death,

89
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,159
was there anything suspicious?

90
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
No.

91
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,159
She always went straight home after work.

92
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,360
What about Ploypapas' work history?

93
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,040
It was average.

94
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,760
But she often skipped work without reporting first.

95
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,120
To be honest, if the company has to reorganize.

96
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,320
Ploypapas would be among the people that will be laid-off.

97
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,360
And have you ever warned Ploy about this?

98
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
Yes. I have.

99
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
Sometimes, we could tell she wasn’t actually sick.

100
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,960
But your company seems generous to the employees,

101
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,000
you even sent her gifts while she was sick.

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,360
Gifts? When?

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,560
We don’t have such policies in place.

104
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Could you gather a list of employees whose names
start with “R” for me?

105
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,600
Urgently, please

106
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,560
We’ve talked to so many people with “R” names,

107
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,240
and we’ve got nothing.

108
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Tell Phu to hurry up with the summary,

109
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,960
in case we'll find something useful.

110
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,520
The manager asked me to bring you this;

111
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,320
the details of the remaining employees.

112
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Thank you.

113
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,440
Don't forget to eat

114
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,200
and take care of yourself.

115
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,840
Yeah.

116
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,320
Who's that?

117
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,560
I'll go first.

118
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
If you need anything,

119
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,400
just let me know.

120
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
Thank you.

121
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,320
You.

122
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,840
RUEANGRIT WITTAYAKITTISAK

123
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,320
Mr. Rueangrit,

124
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,320
why weren’t you included in the questioning?

125
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,880
Oh,

126
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,320
I don’t work in the department that deals directly
with the credit division.

127
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,120
Which department are you in?

128
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm just a messenger in the company.

129
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,880
So, you must’ve seen Ploypapas occasionally, right?

130
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,680
Yes.

131
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,800
In fact, we were pretty close.

132
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,640
Our houses are near each other,

133
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,320
so we often went home together.

134
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,440
So have you ever noticed anything unusual about Ploypapas
before she died?

135
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,320
No.

136
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,080
She looked nornal.

137
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
Being happy.

138
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,360
Then, can I ask you one more question?

139
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,200
Mr. Rueangrit, did you visit her

140
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,480
when she was sick with COVID?

141
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,640
Yes, I did.

142
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,440
The company sent me there.

143
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay.

144
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,640
Should we continue questioning?

145
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,840
No need.

146
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Let’s head to the security camera room.

147
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,000
I checked the CCTV footage. This man clocked out

148
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
right after Ploypapas on the day she was killed.

149
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,200
I reviewed earlier footage,

150
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,720
it turns out he had been doing this for months.

151
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
And take a look at this.

152
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,280
Looks like we’ve caught someone red-handed, huh?

153
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,400
Now all that’s left is solid evidence.

154
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,080
I'll go get a search warrant.

155
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,960
No.

156
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If we ask for a search warrant,

157
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,040
The commander will know that I've been working on this case.

158
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
I want to find evidence in my own way.

159
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,120
Rueangrit just left the house.

160
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,320
Follow him. Hurry up!

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Okay.

162
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,680
Doctor.

163
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Are you busy?

164
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,560
I have to go out. What's wrong?

165
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,040
I want to talk to you.

166
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
Just for a sec.

167
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,480
Could you take this handkerchief and test

168
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,560
for the DNA?

169
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,840
Of which case?

170
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,560
Just check if there's DNA in here.

171
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,360
If there is any, see if it matches anyone.

172
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,840
In my field of work,

173
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,320
I don't test any evidence without proper documentation.

174
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,080
This

175
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
will help identify the real killer of Ploypapas.

176
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,640
But I'd like to ask you something, Doctor.

177
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,640
Could you keep this a secret?

178
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,359
Don't put it in the report yet.

179
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
If we can catch the real killer,

180
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,400
there won't another victim.

181
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,839
I'll talk to May.

182
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,680
Thank you, Doctor.

183
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,400
I better get going.

184
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,720
Should we issue an arrest warrant?

185
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,160
No, Jiu. We can’t.

186
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
We obtained the evidence improperly.

187
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,280
Not us!

188
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,280
You’re the one who went in improperly! So what do we do now?

189
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,240
It looks like he’s already targeting a new victim.

190
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,520
Dr. Run is speeding up the DNA results.

191
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,400
I think having Ploypapas’ DNA in his room, combined with his obsession with the "Raindrop Killer,"

192
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,120
should be enough for us to take action.

193
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,880
But won't it be too late?

194
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,720
What do you mean?

195
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,440
Auntie, check please.

196
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,320
Sorry!

197
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm sorry.

198
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,280
If Rueangrit really idolizes the Raindrop Killer,

199
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,000
then he must always act on rainy nights.

200
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
In that case, Rueangrit might strike again tonight.

201
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,320
Hey, stop.

202
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,480
Jiu!

203
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,920
Are you okay?

204
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,320
Who the fuck are you?

205
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,120
Ugh!

206
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,520
Let me go!

207
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,880
Are you injured?

208
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,520
Jiu, are you okay?

209
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,200
Do you need to go to the hospital?

210
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,160
It's okay. I'm fine.

211
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,720
You better get ready to rot in jail, Rueangrit.

212
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,480
Stop moving!

213
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,640
You should hit him back a few times.

214
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
Don't you always the one who slaps first?

215
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,320
You 're lucky today.

216
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,000
You are the hero of the day. Our unit is so lucky to have you!

217
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,760
Ow!

218
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,240
What's wrong with you?

219
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,680
Will you two talk forever?

220
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,400
Take him to the HQ.

221
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,960
Get up!

222
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,720
Are you okay?

223
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,120
Are you alright?

224
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Phu.

225
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,040
Check the computer for me.

226
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Hello, Doctor.

227
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,640
The DNA test on the handkerchief is out.

228
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,000
The DNA matches with Ploypapas'.

229
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
Thank you so much, Doc.

230
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,560
Now I've caught the killer.

231
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,560
Yeah, I saw the news.

232
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,640
If you want to say

233
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,560
'Inspector Tul, you are the best' ,

234
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,280
feel free to do it.

235
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,080
Say it to yourself, Inspector.

236
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,640
Oh, here he is.

237
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,280
How do you feel about almost being a scapegoat in this case?

238
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,840
Everyone, don't worry.

239
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,800
I'm not charged with this case.

240
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,680
How does it feel to have another killer imitate what you did

241
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,600
18 years ago?

242
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,200
I didn't feel anything.

243
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,960
Do you think there will be public backlash

244
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,960
against the police collaborating with the ex-con like you?

245
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,880
Everyone need to understand

246
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,440
that sometimes in order to catch a criminal

247
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,160
you have to think like one.

248
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
When the news first came out,

249
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,480
we aimed to make the real killer let his guard down.

250
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,720
It was actually my idea.

251
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,720
Thanks to the police

252
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,040
for working so hard to catch the criminal.

253
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,560
I was just

254
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,040
helping for a little.

255
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,120
Please excuse us.

256
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,800
Yes.

257
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,240
This case has clearly shown that

258
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,040
the police are committed to bringing perpetrators to justice, by any means necessary.

259
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,480
Heading home, huh?

260
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,240
Looks like I'm getting famous.

261
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
Even the police have to escort me to the train station.

262
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,440
I'm not here to send you off.

263
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,240
Don't flatter yourself.

264
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I just want to talk to you.

265
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,840
Hurry up, then.

266
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,640
I don't have that much time.

267
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,040
Wisut.

268
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,200
this isn't the first time you are told to say certain things , right?

269
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
What did you mean, Inspector?

270
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,440
The interview you gave to reporters this morning,

271
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,760
and the confession 18 years ago.

272
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,960
Someone forced you to talk, right?

273
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,080
Don't cops always choose to listen to what they wanna hear?

274
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
In the Ploypapas' case,

275
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,520
weren’t you just ready to pin it on me

276
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,080
for the sake of closing the case?

277
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,920
Don’t lump me in with them.

278
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,400
I’m not that kind of officer.

279
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,960
Dear passengers,

280
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,640
The next train is the ordinary train

281
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,360
number 408.

282
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,560
The train will depart from the platform number 3.

283
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm leaving, Inspector.

284
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,760
Hello, Dr. Rak.

285
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
Hello, Inspector Tul.

286
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,520
I have something that may bother you, Doctor.

287
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,040
I need the victims' forensic details

288
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,080
from the Raindrop Killer's case,

289
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,040
18 years ago.

290
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,240
As detailed as possible,

291
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
including anything that wasn’t made public

292
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,640
or might have been overlooked.

293
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,760
What are you going to do with it?

294
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,600
I think

295
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,240
there's something behind this case that we haven't noticed before.

296
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,760
I don't know what you are trying to do.

297
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,000
But the case has been closed for 18 years.

298
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,720
I think reopening it

299
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,880
would only harm you, Inspector.

300
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,320
Doctor, I'd like to ask you,

301
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
do you really think that

302
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,400
Wisut is guilty?

303
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,160
When I found out about the details of the Raindrop Killer

304
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
while I was working on the Ploypapas' case,

305
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,000
I can feel that

306
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,840
what we've known

307
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,680
and the reality of what actually happened might not be the same.

308
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,680
Let's give her the information, Dad.

309
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,280
Maybe,

310
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,400
she might find something that we missed before.

311
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,400
The cause of death of every case

312
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,520
is head trauma.

313
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,960
Upon observing, in the first two cases,

314
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,480
you can see that the skulls had multiple fractures

315
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,000
it seemed the killer wasn’t very skilled yet.

316
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,040
But after the third case,

317
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,640
the strikes became precise, targeting the Pterion.

318
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,960
One hit was enough to kill.

319
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,560
Why weren't the last two cases examined here?

320
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,200
The police dropped me from the case out of the blue.

321
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,280
I've tried to tell them

322
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,760
that I should continue the autopsy,

323
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,120
because I was  the one who know all the forensic details of each case.

324
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,280
But in the end, the cases were reassigned to

325
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,120
Dr. Kerdpong,

326
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,800
a forensic doctor who is close to Big Tech.

327
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,920
Not long after Kirdpong performed the autopsy

328
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,640
on the last two cases,

329
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
The police immediately concluded that

330
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Wisut was the killer.

331
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,440
This is a significant breakthrough—

332
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,920
the arrest of the copycat killer

333
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,360
by the special investigation team,

334
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,400
led by Big Tech.

335
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,240
Former murder suspect Wisut has been appointed as the consultant…

336
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,120
Consultant, my ass!

337
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Always eating desserts, huh?

338
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,640
Aren't you afraid of diabetes, Doctor?

339
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,840
Aren’t you worried about getting scolded

340
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,960
for meddling in someone’s food choices, Inspector?

341
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,120
It’s tiring to stand and chat.

342
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,560
Can I sit with you?

343
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,480
Suit yourself.

344
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,080
Well,

345
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,280
I got information from your father.

346
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,960
Thank you so much for convincing him,

347
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,880
otherwise I wouldn't have all the information.

348
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
You also thinks the same as I do, right, Inspector?

349
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,840
What has been happening

350
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,360
isn't commited by Wisut.

351
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Actually,

352
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,680
I feel like there's something off.

353
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,200
but no one in the police force dared to reopen it.

354
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,000
Then, I met a crazy bulldog like you.

355
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,280
Looks like we’re on the same wavelength.

356
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,760
No, we just happened to think the same.

357
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,120
Doctor.

358
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,760
Don't think too much.

359
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,800
I'm looking for information from Dr. Rak

360
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,720
because I'm willing to do whatever it takes

361
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,320
to bring justic to this case.

362
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,560
It's all for the victims including your mother as well.

363
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,040
Dad and I kept the documents at home.

364
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,200
So if you don't mind,

365
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,800
I'll be there to take a look at them.

366
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,280
Maybe the case will progress.

367
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,160
We all want to know the truth  as soon as possible, right?

368
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,880
You can come,

369
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,840
but don’t think I’ll let you walk away with those documents easily.

370
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,520
Deal!

371
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,760
See you this evening after work.

372
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

373
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,040
You go first.

374
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,320
Have you ever talked to Wisut?

375
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,080
What kind of a person is he?

376
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,840
A pain in the neck.

377
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,080
Can you explain something more useful?

378
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,400
But he really is.

379
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,040
He’s evasive, inconsistent—

380
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,840
one day he says he’s the killer,

381
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,920
the next he denies it.

382
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,440
And he’s always making demands.

383
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,920
Could that be a smokescreen to hide something else?

384
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,440
You really think someone who has been in jail for almost 20 years

385
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,440
will be easy to understand?

386
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,720
I don't know,

387
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,040
But honestly, the day I talked to him at the train station,

388
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,680
he seemed off.

389
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,240
What he said was also strange.

390
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,720
It seemed like he was implying that

391
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,040
he isn't the killer.

392
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,600
He made me feel

393
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,080
that the police particularly targeted him.

394
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,920
Then, why didn't you ask him that day

395
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
what exactly does he want to say.

396
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,680
We only talked for a moment.

397
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,920
I didn't get a chance to ask him anything.

398
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,840
And it seemed like he didn't really want to talk.

399
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,720
Well, Doc.

400
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,480
In your point of view as a doctor,

401
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,680
What kind of a person the Raindrop Killer should be ?

402
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,880
I think

403
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,880
that person might have some internal conflicts.

404
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,600
Maybe mental illness or

405
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,840
personality dirorder of some sort.

406
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,680
The external factors are probably family issues and

407
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,600
gender bias.

408
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,720
At first glance he may seem  completely normal,

409
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,040
or even very likable.

410
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,840
I don't know

411
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,680
whether you will guess the apperance correctly or not.

412
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,680
but I’m certain about one thing: all the victims were targeted because they were sex workers.

413
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,400
Except for my mom.

414
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
Why?

415
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,640
Oh,

416
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,000
I've never thought that you are addicted to dessert this much.

417
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
I will buy you a cake next time.

418
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,080
I don't eat cake,

419
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,240
I only eat bread and pastry.

420
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
That's great, Doc.

421
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,400
I'll take you to the best bakery in the world.

422
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,600
Let's take a break. I'll bring you there.

423
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,720
Is there anyone here?

424
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,520
Win!

425
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,840
Hey!

426
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,040
Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?

427
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,760
Then it wouldn’t be a surprise!

428
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
I hate surprises, you know it.

429
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,640
Wow.

430
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,440
A baker boy.

431
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,200
You've grown a lot, huh?

432
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,080
That's enough.

433
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,040
Did you do all of these by youself?

434
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,240
Yeah.

435
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
So, how long are you staying in Thailand?

436
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,240
No set plans.

437
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,640
I’ll stay here for a while

438
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,080
until my business project

439
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,560
takes shape.

440
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,640
I just got to work on a new project.

441
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,880
I'm planning to bring a famous dessert chain from England

442
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,120
to open a new branch in Thailand.

443
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,400
And when I came back,

444
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,200
you were the first person I thought of.

445
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,640
Uh-huh.

446
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,320
I mean, actually

447
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,280
I want you to be my dessert consultant.

448
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:32,480
Are you sure I'm good enough?

449
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,440
Tin,

450
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,640
If you're not good enough,

451
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,080
then no one is.

452
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,240
Plus,

453
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,600
you’re the only friend I’ve got.

454
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,680
You deal?

455
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,080
Okay.

456
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,480
Thank you so much.

457
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,640
Love you, man!

458
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,760
Yeah.

459
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,400
At first I thought you wouldn't say yes.

460
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,240
Do you run this place alone,

461
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,120
or with your girlfriend?

462
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,440
Girlfriend? Please.

463
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
It’s just me and Tul, like always.

464
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't have time to find any girlfriends.

465
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,040
Are you planning to stay single forever?

466
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,200
Are you crazy?

467
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Come here, come here.

468
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,520
let me set you up. What’s your type?

469
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,720
I'll find one for you.

470
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,520
You better mind you own business, okay?

471
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,120
Worry about yourself first.

472
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
How many breakups have you had now?

473
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,400
Can I borrow your toes to help me count?

474
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,520
You want me to count, huh?

475
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,600
It's countless.

476
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,080
Oh, Kawin.

477
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,360
Hello there.

478
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,840
Tul, right?

479
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,600
You’ve gotten even prettier. I almost can't remember!

480
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,320
Prettier?  Nah, look at this face first.

481
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,280
Who is this, your friend?

482
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,280
You look like you're hungry, huh?

483
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,480
Dinner’s on me tonight.

484
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,640
Kawin, go home!

485
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,840
My little sis is a respectable cop.

486
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,600
If anyone sees her hanging out with a playboy like you,

487
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,840
it’ll ruin her reputation.

488
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,280
That's harsh!

489
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,840
You're so dramatic.

490
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,080
Relax, Tin. It’s not every day Kawin comes back.

491
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,120
Stay and eat with us, okay?

492
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,840
Nah, better not. The longer I stay, the angrier Tin will get.

493
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
I’ll leave now.

494
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,440
I’ve got a meeting with a partner anyway.

495
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,880
I’ll contact you later.

496
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,440
Okay.

497
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm leaving.

498
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,520
Bye bye.

499
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,920
Fine, go.

500
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,120
Sorry if my friend caused any trouble.

501
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,360
Is this your friend?

502
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,920
This is Doctor Run.

503
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,240
The forensic doctor I've worked with on the cases

504
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,480
This is Tin.

505
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,880
The owner of the most delicious bakery.

506
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,880
Hello, Tin.

507
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,480
Please have a seat first.

508
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,000
I have some dessert that I want you to test too.

509
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,880
Let me get it for you.

510
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,320
Quickly, please.

511
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,840
I know!

512
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Hey.

513
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,080
You tricked me into eating your brother's dessert, didn't you?

514
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,880
Nah, just try it first.

515
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,880
My brother

516
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,680
is really a good baker.

517
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,040
Which one isn't delicious, you can just tell me.

518
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,160
Oh, Hed!

519
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,760
How did you get in?

520
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,760
Sorry, Dr. Run.

521
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,360
Tin, don't scold her.

522
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,360
Well, I don't want her to bother the customers.

523
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,160
Some customers are also afraid of cats.

524
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,160
It's okay. I'm not scared.

525
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,280
Hm.

526
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,040
Look at how she makes a face.

527
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,920
Normally, she doesn't let anyone to touch her,

528
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,640
even someone who feeds her everyday.

529
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,840
She doesn't even like you!

530
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,000
That's true.

531
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,640
This means she really knows whom she can rely on.

532
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,640
Only choose to play with pretty people like Dr. Run, right?

533
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,200
What else?

534
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,520
Dr. Run! The officer is attacking me.

535
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,040
May I?

536
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,120
How does it feel, huh?

537
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,480
To capture Rueangrit.

538
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,880
It feels good.

539
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,240
Finally the real killer has been punished.

540
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,920
And the innocent is set free.

541
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,960
Well done, Inspector.

542
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,680
You’ve proven yourself

543
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,640
a top-tier detective in the special investigation unit.

544
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,240
You deserve a reward.

545
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,840
I’ll recommend you for a promotion to head of the Crime Suppression Division.

546
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,240
With what condition, sir?

547
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,880
Just stop digging up the case from

548
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,840
18 years ago.

549
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,960
I don't want that crazy Raindrop Killer to shake
the public's confidence in us.

550
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,640
I just caught Rueangrit.

551
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,440
I haven't done anything about the Raindrop case yet.

552
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,400
Really?

553
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,040
But I know that you're trying to contact Wisut.

554
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,640
Do you really think that

555
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,400
this kind of thing can escape my notice?

556
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,480
Did Wisut tell you?

557
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,680
That's none of your business.

558
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,600
Let's just say you're willing to accept my offer.

559
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,920
I haven’t done anything significant enough to deserve the place in the Crime Suppression Division, sir.

560
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,040
Besides, I have my principles.

561
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,720
I know the kind of officer I don’t want to become.

562
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,600
A bird without feathers,

563
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,080
a man without allies

564
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,840
can never soar high.

565
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,640
And I can't guarantee that you'll get a second chance like this again.

566
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,040
If those feathers mean

567
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,440
making connection,

568
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,400
serving the higher-ups

569
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,440
and running around, looking for political favour

570
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,040
then, I'm content with my current position.

571
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,240
No need to trouble yourself, sir.

572
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,280
I've heard that

573
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,080
you’re entering politics after your term ends.

574
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,200
Congratulations in advance.

575
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,840
I hope you win

576
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,160
without any scandals tarnishing your record.

577
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,160
As for me,

578
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,840
I’ll focus on my current responsibilities.

579
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,600
If there's nothing else,

580
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,560
I may excuse myself.

581
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,920
Sir,

582
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,440
You almost framed Wisut as the scapegoat in the Ploypapas' murder, how do you plan to take responsibility for that?"

583
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,400
Please answer.

584
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,280
Let me go!

585
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,160
I already gave the interview that I invited Wisut to be the consultant.

586
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,200
Then is it possible that Wisut might not be guilty of

587
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,880
the case you closed eighteen years ago?

588
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,200
You think being a journalist makes you
have the right to stir up baseless stories?

589
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,840
Do you have any evidence?

590
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,520
I'm just asking on behlaf of the people.

591
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,880
Because there are a lot of people who doubt this,

592
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,480
Which news agency are you from?

593
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,720
Are you even a real journalist?

594
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,200
I think you should calm down.

595
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,160
I'm not answering any more questions.

596
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,960
If your agency has any concerns,

597
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,080
they can submit an official inquiry.

598
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,440
Don't forget about  that eletrรc cigarettes news too.

599
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,320
Got it?

600
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,720
Go!

601
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,840
Tiwa!

602
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,400
You still dare to come to the station, huh?

603
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,160
Do you even realize what you’ve done?

604
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,280
What have I done?

605
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,040
The boss has ordered you to stop digging up that case,

606
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,760
or else we all will get in trouble.

607
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,440
I'm just asking questions.

608
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,440
People want to know about this.

609
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,680
Damn it! I've told you so many times

610
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,440
not to touch the case 18 years ago.

611
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,960
Otherwise, our department will be screwed up.

612
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,760
But we haven't done anything wrong.

613
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,280
Don’t let them intimidate us, Sumet. High-ranking officers always bully the media like this. Don’t give in.

614
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,120
You're always like this!

615
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,840
Do you know what I've been through?

616
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,320
The lawyer filed one condition.

617
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,360
If we accept it, Big Tech won't press charge.

618
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,160
The only condition is your news program has to be
 pulled from the schedule.

619
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,600
What?

620
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,000
It's an order from the above.

621
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,840
Your programe won't air anymore.

622
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,400
What your future will bring, I have no idea.

623
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,400
Sumet.

624
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,080
Hold on--

625
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,520
Shit!

626
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,640
And what will you do next?

627
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,960
Getting cut from the program schedule is basically being shelved.

628
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,240
I 'm thinking of starting my own news channel on social media.

629
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,040
Everyone likes to watch short, concise new clips these days.

630
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,360
Well, are you okay?

631
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,200
Do you want me to be there?

632
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,600
I'm fine.

633
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,440
Run, no need to worry.

634
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,040
Are you sure?

635
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,160
If there's anything I can help, let me know.

636
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,840
Um, thank you so much.

637
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,640
Hey.

638
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,040
You.

639
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,800
I'm sorry.

640
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,480
I didn't mean to wake you up.

641
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,480
It's getting late.

642
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,480
I'm sorry.

643
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,440
I think I'd better head back.

644
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,800
Tin.

645
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,480
Aren't you going out to the shop?

646
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,440
I just walked back

647
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,640
to pack more bread.

648
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,840
But you

649
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
come back at dawn for many days already, huh?

650
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,520
Are you okay?

651
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,120
It’s just a busy period.

652
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,440
Once this case is over, things will settle.

653
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,120
Well, I don't know what case you're working on.

654
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,440
But I've got only you, okay?

655
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,600
Uh-huh.

656
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,200
What are you complaining about?

657
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,120
You are just lonely.

658
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,080
because I'm not around.

659
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,280
No! It's not!

660
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,440
I think

661
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,400
if you're lonely lately,

662
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,640
why don't you call Kawin and ask him to come here?

663
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,960
Oh, oh

664
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,640
Oh what?

665
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,520
Your face changed.

666
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,520
What?

667
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,720
Didn't I tell you that there’s nothing between me and Kawin?

668
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,520
Don't try to set me up,.

669
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,720
I haven't said anything.

670
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,720
You're overreacting.

671
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,240
But...

672
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,080
you're not so young anymore,

673
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,440
you should care more about love.

674
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,800
Why don't looking for someone?

675
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,760
Just be careful.

676
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,640
Or else you'll be lonely when you're old.

677
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,760
I don’t have time for that.

678
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,640
Just taking care of you for the rest of your life

679
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,240
require so much work already.

680
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,080
Don't forget.

681
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,240
I won't stay with you forever.

682
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,600
I'll have my own family one day.

683
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,760
But you

684
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,360
hm?

685
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,640
I haven't asked about you and Dr. Run yet.

686
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,000
What's the deal between you two?

687
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,000
You brought my dessert for her. Bring her home.

688
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,120
Except Hed,

689
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,120
you never brought anyone home.

690
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,200
Okay

691
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,080
Alright, I'll ask you then.

692
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,680
Have you ever been so close to anyone

693
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,000
that your heart beat faster than normal?

694
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,360
Does that mean you like someone?

695
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Well, is this about Dr. Run?

696
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,760
It's not!

697
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,440
I'm just asking in general.

698
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,240
Okay.

699
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,960
Just in general.

700
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,800
Well,

701
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,040
When  you like someone,

702
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,680
well, everyone feels differently.

703
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,440
It's hard to put it into words.

704
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,720
But for me,

705
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,040
one thing that I can recommend

706
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,760
is to ask yourself first

707
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,720
and when you know the answer,

708
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,960
you better be honest with yourself.

709
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,320
That's it.

710
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,840
Is it really that easy?

711
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,880
But I warned you.

712
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,080
Good and beautiful people like Dr. Run

713
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,120
won't stay single for a long time.

714
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,640
You came to see me this early,

715
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,840
anything I can help?

716
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,240
Well,

717
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,680
I brought you some desserts.

718
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,440
Thank you.

719
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,880
But...

720
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,200
is there anything you wanna talk about?

721
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,440
Um...

722
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,240
I saw you talking to that reporter last night.

723
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,880
You mean Tiwa?

724
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,840
I want to know...

725
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,600
how close are you and Tiwa.

726
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,640
And why would that matter to you?

727
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,080
Of course it matters.

728
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:10,600
Tiwa has been reporting on the Raindrop Killer
and Big Tech cases a lot.

729
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,320
I’m worried she might manipulate you into giving her information
that she can misreport.

730
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,240
Tiwa wouldn't do that.

731
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,000
I've known her since the early days of studying Forensics.

732
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,000
She only publishes truthful stories,

733
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,040
unlike other reporters.

734
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,200
Don't worry.

735
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,560
Are you that close to her personally?

736
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,000
Why would you want to know about me and Tiwa?

737
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,120
What if I want to tell Dr. Run I like her?

738
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,080
How do I even start?

739
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,120
Well, I know that

740
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,640
you always speak what you feel.

741
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But for this kind of thing, you should take it slow this time

742
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,520
You should drop hints,

743
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,400
observe her reaction. Got it?

744
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,640
Um...

745
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm not thinking of you as just a colleague anymore, Doc.

746
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,440
I like you.

747
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,200
My brother said I have to do something,

748
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,000
because a beautiful woman like you
won’t stay single for long.

749
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,040
Well,

750
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,680
what kind of advice your brother is teaching you?

751
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,600
Is your whole family this odd?

752
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:54,720
But...

753
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,320
if you don't like me, that's fine.

754
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,640
I'm a grown woman.

755
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,440
I can handle my own feelings.

756
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,600
Staying quiet like this.

757
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,240
Does that mean you also feel the same?

758
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,800
No, it's not.

759
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,120
Okay.

760
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,200
So...

761
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,880
I better excuse myself.

762
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,440
Focus on your work then.

763
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,920
Well,

764
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,040
I didn't say that

765
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,920
I'm not gonna like you.

766
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,240
But...

767
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,320
I don't want our relationship to affect work.

768
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,560
You know how important this case is to me.

769
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,840
So...

770
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,440
once everything's solved,

771
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,280
we can talk about this again, okay?

772
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,080
What you are saying

773
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,440
means that you also like me!

774
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,640
I said it's not!

775
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Maybe get your ears checked sometime!

776
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,240
Then I'll take you to the hospital, Doc.

777
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,720
Well, well, well

778
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,840
what happened at forensics?

779
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,560
Don’t keep your little bro and sis in the dark!

780
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,800
What?

781
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,760
I just went to ask about the case. Nothing else.

782
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,040
The case or the love, huh?

783
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,920
What's wrong with you guys?

784
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,560
You guys are so weird.

785
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,520
You and Dr. Run have been ‘off’ for a while now.

786
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,840
I’ve been rooting for you two so hard,
I don’t even know how to root anymore!"

787
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,440
And who told you to root for me?

788
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,040
Until we can solve the Raindrop Killer case,

789
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,440
everything else has to wait.

790
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:56,040
Dr. Run said she didn't want our relationship to affect work, okay?

791
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,640
Ah?

792
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,040
Are you saying that

793
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,200
you've confessed to Dr. Run already?

794
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,120
You're not answering, huh?

795
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,280
You're really something, huh? No wonder why you're
the best of the best!

796
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,440
Really?

797
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,080
You're overacting!

798
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,080
But I guess nobody cares about that.

799
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,320
If you want to date her, just do it.

800
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,600
Go!

801
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,600
Uh-huh.

802
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,000
Well, Jiuberry

803
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,400
you're teaching others now, huh?

804
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,680
My Inspector Tul

805
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,960
always knows what's the right thing to do.

806
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,920
She knows her game; she moves fast,

807
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,440
while you, well..

808
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,840
you’re still stuck in neutral.

809
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,520
When will you get to date May?

810
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,040
Oh.

811
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,000
You underestimate me.

812
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,760
Watch.

813
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,640
I’ll win May over

814
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,800
before Tul and Dr. Run get together.

815
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,840
Really?

816
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,760
Sure!

817
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,240
I'll wait and see!

818
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,280
Hello, S.R. news desk.

819
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,120
Serg., found any signs of the suspects?

820
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,320
Just some footprints, but the rain’s washing them away.

821
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,520
And there’s no sign that the body was dragged here.

822
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,080
Everything is clean, like it was placed there on purpose.

823
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:13,920
Hello.

824
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,720
Got it.

825
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,960
Everyone, gear up. Head to the scene.

826
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,920
Wait. Hold on.

827
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,960
The Commander hasn’t given us the order to move yet.

828
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,320
But this case is like the Raindrop Killer case!

829
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,080
What are you waiting for?

830
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,840
Let's not interfere with the local police.

831
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,240
It's the local police who just called me!

832
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,320
Phu, Jiu. Let's go.

833
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,800
Inspector.

834
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,440
We'll have to wait for an order

835
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,040
first.

836
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,320
If you want to wait, then wait.

837
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,440
But don't get in my way.

838
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,440
This odd package just arrived.

839
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,840
To Police Lieutenant Colonel Tech Archawasin

840
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,840
That's the rank of  Big Tech

841
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,800
18 years ago.

842
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,320
Shit!

843
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,240
If you're the real killer, I'll handle this case myself.

844
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,280
Don't worry.

845
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,760
I don't like to talk to those cops anyway.

846
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,880
I want to know

847
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,840
if you're mad at me.

848
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,120
Didn't you say that you don't wan to talk to the cops?
