Hey, Tin.

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,080
What’re you up to?

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,520
Nah, it's nothing.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm hungry.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,680
Let’s go eat.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,960
Sure, sure. Get off.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,920
Want a hand?

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,680
Let’s go eat!

11
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,280
Oy Kawin.

12
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,400
Why call me here?

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,120
I called you to come fix a leak at home.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,880
Yeah, yeah. I’ll do it later.

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,680
In 2 or 3 days.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,080
So is it 2 or is it 3?

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,360
Don’t worry.

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
Alright, OK.

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,960
2's good.

20
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,079
3’s okay.

21
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,920
Thank you man.

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,240
Only you can do all this.

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Tin.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Hm?

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,560
Let me ask you straight,

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,680
you’ve been doing it again, right?

27
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,480
Do what?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,640
I've known this for 18 years.

29
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,320
you are the killer that’s in the news!

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,480
I saw what’s in your camcorder.

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
So it was you.

32
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,760
I thought that you had quit.

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
But you haven’t.

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Tin, man.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,320
The world’s so advanced now!

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,720
You won’t get off easy this time!

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
What you need to do,

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,360
you just have to stop.

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,920
Stop it!

40
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
And then run.

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,600
Anywhere’s fine!

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,480
Overseas, somewhere else,

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,840
no one’s gonna find you!

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
I am worried for you.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,079
I just want you to live a normal life, like other people.

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,400
I don’t want you to live like this, bud.

47
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,320
Run away, Tin.

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
I’ll help you.

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
‘Kay. Thanks.

50
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,840
I’ll help you.

51
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,040
There’s a case report saying that,

52
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
3 months ago.

53
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
3 months ago.

54
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,360
a case happened the same way.

55
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,880
Same method.

56
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,800
Same antler symbol.

57
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,640
And the killer,

58
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,880
is my brother.

59
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,760
When on a mission of four

60
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,120
He shot Pae Sae Heng to death instead of me.

61
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,080
Thanks.

62
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Actually, you don’t have to stay here.

63
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,880
How can you stand it?

64
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,880
Tin used to live here, Run.

65
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,640
But this is your home too.

66
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,800
You’re sure that Tin must’ve left some trails behind, aren’t you?

67
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,400
I am not here only because I am worried for you.

68
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
But also because

69
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,600
we need to finally make things right for everyone.

70
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
Are you sure about all this?

71
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,080
That what you said isn't just to soothe me.

72
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,880
Of course.

73
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,480
You promised, didn’t you?

74
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
You won’t break it,

75
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,440
right?

76
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
Yeah.

77
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,159
I won’t go back on my word.

78
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
Thank you.

79
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,480
I don’t want to keep this from everyone anymore.

80
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,120
And,

81
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,280
I don’t wanna play dumb and let the killer run free.

82
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,440
I’m sorry, Run.

83
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,520
I’m truly sorry.

84
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
It’s okay, Tul.

85
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,000
Shoot me!

86
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,600
Why won’t you shoot?!

87
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,960
Tul.

88
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,000
Don’t worry about Dr. Run’s safety.

89
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,480
Right now our agents are searching for the killer.

90
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,480
He shouldn’t have time to go after Dr. Run for a while.

91
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,280
Yeah.

92
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,480
Well, how about your search?

93
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,880
Found anything?

94
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,000
Here.

95
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,640
I’ve checked.

96
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,520
This rental car’s similar in appearance to the car that day.

97
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,800
You sure, Phu?

98
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,680
This is big, you know that?

99
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,640
Well, I recalled that the plate’s 5326,

100
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,400
so I checked with both the Transport Department and the rental car network.

101
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,080
But somehow every single car’s got an alibi.

102
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,920
It just felt off,

103
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,480
so I, genius that I am,

104
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,680
changed the 6 to an 8.

105
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
And…jackpot!

106
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Definitely the same car

107
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Same conditions.

108
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,960
If it’s a rental,

109
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,160
then the plan was to kill from the start.

110
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,640
We gotta go ask the owner.

111
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,200
They might know something.

112
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
Maybe they have info on the renter.

113
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,720
I got the renter’s number,

114
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
but calls just didn’t connect.

115
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,480
So, we go through the footage from the shop then,

116
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
or from the surrounding area, Phu.

117
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,480
Phu!

118
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,800
Phu!

119
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,120
A word in the office. Now.

120
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,280
As I thought, you are still on your brother’s case.

121
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,040
How obstinate, like him.

122
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,040
I should’ve sent you to medical school, and not here.

123
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,080
That had nothing to do with you.

124
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,280
I chose to be a police myself.

125
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,360
Soon, I’ll retire.

126
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,080
My influences won’t be protecting you for much longer.

127
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,080
You. Have some obedience.

128
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,720
Do as I ordered you to.

129
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,760
A dog that doesn’t listen to orders

130
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,840
won’t end well.

131
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,720
Don’t be all talk.

132
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,960
You want to get into politics?

133
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,480
Who knows if you’ll get votes.

134
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,160
Oh well, that’s okay.

135
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,080
So from now on, good police will have a place to shine.

136
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,600
Without evil to drag them down.

137
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,040
Starting now, you are on indefinite suspension.

138
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
You can’t stop me.

139
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,840
Even if I’ve to put my own brother in jail,

140
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,720
I will catch the Raindrop Killer myself.

141
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,400
I want you all to focus on the latest victim.

142
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,080
MP Chutikarn’s case.

143
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,040
Because not just anyone would have access to her.

144
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,680
Arthit is on record for assaulting his sister,

145
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,120
The Raindrop Killer’s sixth victim.

146
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,440
He also knows MP Chutikarn personally.

147
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,920
Does this mean that Wisut’s been innocent this whole time?

148
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
So, this means

149
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
that we took in the wrong guy?

150
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,520
Look,

151
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Arthit’s panicking because his assistant Wisut’s gone.

152
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,080
And so the fact that they’ve been partners since 18 years ago has surfaced.

153
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,200
We tell the people this,

154
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,600
and all will be over.

155
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,680
The police is gathering evidence and witnesses,

156
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,280
to request an arrest warrant from the court for Arthit

157
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,040
on charge of cooperating with Wisut

158
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,080
to murder seven victims since 18 years ago.

159
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,160
We found evidence that Arthit was well-acquainted with every victim.

160
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,120
Especially MP Chutikarn, the latest victim.

161
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,840
Arthit’s movement in the time period without Wisut

162
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,760
gave us leads and links to the past cases.

163
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,800
We will catch the real perpetrator

164
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,880
and prove to all the integrity of our profession.

165
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,400
That the duty of the police is to protect the general public,

166
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,320
and not influential people or others.

167
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,480
I promise that as long as I remain a policeman

168
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,480
or involved in other capacities,

169
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,080
I will do all I can

170
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,920
to prevent such horrifying murders from happening
in our country again.

171
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,640
To suddenly dismiss you like this, this isn’t right!

172
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,240
This is just bullying you from going further.

173
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,120
Don’t worry you two.

174
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,440
If I can’t play by the rules,

175
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,080
then I am getting around them.

176
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,920
I am going now.

177
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,880
Commander.

178
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,040
Aren’t you the one who’s been working closely with Big Tech all this time?

179
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,720
Right now Big Tech’s on the prowl for a new scapegoat.

180
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,840
Someone’s going to get the Wisut treatment.

181
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,600
We need to do something.

182
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
I am in a tough spot already.

183
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,800
What authority can I use to help you catch the perpetrator?

184
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,280
You don’t even have to help catch the perp.

185
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,080
Protecting an innocent man is enough.

186
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,480
How about we join hands to reveal the true past?

187
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Give it up.

188
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,720
There’s no point in fighting.

189
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,480
Every profession has its good and bad people.

190
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,000
The police is no exception.

191
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,800
But isn’t the police law enforcement itself?!

192
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
Commander,

193
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,680
can you really just accept

194
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,800
that there are both good and bad cops?!

195
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
If you are police,

196
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,720
shouldn’t you be a good one?

197
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,880
Old as you are,

198
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,920
please make yourself useful for once.

199
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,040
For the sake of police honor, can’t you do what’s right for once?!

200
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,200
With things like this, only you can help us.

201
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,480
Just tell the truth from 18 years ago.

202
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
I’ll deal with the rest myself.

203
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm sorry.

204
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,840
But don’t pin your hopes on me.

205
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,080
I don’t want to be on the losing side.

206
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,360
Find a way on your own.

207
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,160
Commander!

208
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,960
Hello, Tul.

209
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,880
You got suspended at noon

210
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,360
and yet you still aren’t home.

211
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
I’ve called you many times.

212
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
Why didn’t you pick up?

213
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
Whether I am a cop or not,

214
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
I don’t care anymore.

215
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,160
No matter where or what I am,

216
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,680
I still can catch the killer.

217
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Are you drunk?

218
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,440
You are drinking, aren’t you?

219
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,800
I didn’t drink.

220
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,640
Just having some beer.

221
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,120
One. Two…

222
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,480
Only four bottles.

223
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,920
Run

224
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,080
Do you think

225
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
I can catch Tin?

226
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,920
No.

227
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,080
I will catch him.

228
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,680
Yes, you can and will catch him.

229
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,880
But now shouldn’t you start by coming home?

230
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,680
This is no time to drink.

231
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,440
Oh.

232
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,480
Why are you scolding me?

233
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't you love me?

234
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Tul.

235
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Don’t be a petulant child.

236
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,080
I’m sad.

237
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,720
If drinking’s no good, you want me as a nun?

238
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
I can’t stand staying there.

239
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Please understand.

240
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,640
But you can.

241
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,800
If I can stay here, then you can stay here.

242
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
Usually when I’m drunk,

243
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,200
the person at home always comes to pick me up.

244
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,080
I am too tired to go back.

245
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Come get me please.

246
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,360
Fine.

247
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,880
Careful.

248
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,280
What’s wrong baby, tell me.

249
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,240
I’m sad.

250
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,080
Things have only made me sad.

251
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
You’re not sad just because of the suspension, right?

252
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,200
So, where exactly did you go today?

253
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,880
Jealous?

254
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,480
Tul.

255
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,960
I went to see Commander Pichet.

256
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,680
Asked him to reveal the truth from 18 years ago.

257
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,800
But that didn’t help.

258
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,000
Everyone’s scared shitless.

259
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,120
What did the Commander say?

260
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,200
A man who can’t stand on his own two feet,

261
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,840
what help could he give us?

262
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,920
I have no cards left to play.

263
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,800
My sole advantage, is probably being the killer’s sister.

264
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,000
Don’t know if this is good or bad luck.

265
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,280
You got me, yeah?

266
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,280
Hm?

267
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
I do get you.

268
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,640
But for now

269
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,960
how about a shower first?

270
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,280
I’m sleepy. I wanna sleep here.

271
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,080
Please?

272
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,360
Didn’t know you get this clingy when drunk.

273
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,320
You like it?

274
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm sleeping here.

275
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,760
Got some soft pillows.

276
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
Pervert.

277
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,120
Who’s that?

278
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,640
I’ll go check.

279
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,800
[ 17 OCTOBER ]

280
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,880
17 October?

281
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,480
Why 17 October?

282
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,600
The Meteorological Department announced that,

283
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
17 October

284
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,640
marks the end of the rainy season.

285
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
This must be a taunt,

286
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,040
saying that he’lll kill again

287
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,680
on the final day of the rainy season.

288
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,000
Tul.

289
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,120
Hm?

290
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,880
I think we should tell Phu and Jiu about this.

291
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,760
We can’t do this on our own.

292
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,640
On the 17th,

293
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,280
Tin will probably do something.

294
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,920
We need to know what that is,

295
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,000
and who will be the target.

296
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,880
If we know,

297
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
we’ll be able to turn this on Tin and catch him.

298
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Don’t bite your nails.

299
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,640
They will get ruined!

300
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,400
Well, I’m stressed.

301
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,320
Come.

302
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,480
Come here.

303
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,640
Come here.

304
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,880
Is this so urgent that we need to take a day off and come here?

305
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,680
Well,

306
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,920
it’s about the case.

307
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,040
The night Run got abducted,

308
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,160
I said that

309
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,120
I didn’t see the Raindrop Killer's face.

310
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,680
That’s a lie. The truth is I remember the killer’s face.

311
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,840
Really!?

312
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,920
Then, should we call a sketch artist?

313
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,480
So they can sketch his likeness to announce.

314
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
No need for announcements.

315
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,480
I know that person well.

316
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,280
That person is Tin.

317
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,880
What?

318
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,480
Tin?

319
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,120
My brother is the killer.

320
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,480
Oy! What’re you doing?!

321
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,560
Hey! What’re you arresting me for!?

322
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,880
Hey! Tul.

323
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,520
The news said that the killer’s been caught.

324
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,600
I didn't do it.

325
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,800
Let me go.

326
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,840
I didn’t do it! I didn’t do it!

327
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,920
Let go.

328
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,160
Please do not worry.

329
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,360
We now have the perpetrator in our custody.

330
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,640
As for what is next, it is our duty to follow the investigation process.

331
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,480
We definitely will not let him slip away.

332
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,120
You all don’t have to be worried.

333
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,680
As long as I am here,

334
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,080
please rest easy.

335
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,000
Even though today is my final day as a policeman.

336
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,960
For I have retired.

337
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,280
But I can still take care of you all in another capacity.

338
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,280
Ah,

339
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,560
try and check if there’s a car with a plate like I said.

340
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,880
Okay, sure.

341
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,880
Ah! Hello Tor.

342
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,320
You really have sent the info yeah?

343
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,680
The plate’s 5328. Black!

344
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,480
Hey!

345
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,520
Thank you, thank you!

347
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,840
You found the car, Phu?

348
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,320
Yep.

349
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,800
Here, my friend at the local PD sent me this.

350
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,240
From the CCTV footage, this car went into an apartment near Trok Rong Moo.

351
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,880
It’s this one, Tul! The same car from that day.

352
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,080
There’s nothing in there.

353
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,840
Excuse me.

354
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,360
What room is the owner of this car in?

355
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,640
Phu.

356
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,880
On the second floor.

357
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
Room 1209.

358
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,880
Thank you.

359
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,560
Go.

360
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
Is anyone there?

361
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,840
Phu!

362
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Tul, look at this.

363
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,480
[ IF YOU SEE MY FACE, YOU WILL DIE. ]

364
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,120
“If you see my face, you will die.”

365
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,960
What does that mean?

366
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,040
I think that it points to

367
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,520
Tin’s next victim.

368
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,680
If you see my face, you have to die.

369
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,360
But that day I went to see him

370
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,440
because I was worried that Kawin was going to kill him.

371
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,080
But Kawin’s already dead now.

372
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,680
I think that

373
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,600
this time, he means me.

374
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,440
But, don’t killers choose similar people for victims?

375
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,360
But Tin has killed Kawin, Tul.

376
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,880
That wasn’t in his plans at all.

377
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,600
I think that he’s killing to get away.

378
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,360
I don’t see any reason why Tin has to kill you.

379
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,640
You didn’t do anything to him.

380
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,400
Have you forgotten?

381
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,080
I was the sole witness at the scene.

382
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,480
I saw that he was the killer.

383
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,680
And him sending a message like this,

384
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,480
means that he’s certain the police can’t catch him.

385
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,960
Unless, he wants you to catch him.

386
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,280
Tul.

387
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,920
We need to take this chance.

388
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,560
What do you mean?

389
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,200
If I am really his target,

390
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,680
then it means that you have a great opportunity to catch him.

391
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,080
What are you talking about?

392
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,280
I will never let you be a bait.

393
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,280
No way.

394
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,600
But it’s the only way to catch him!

395
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,760
I said no.

396
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,920
Tul, listen to me.

397
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,600
Tin killed my mom.

398
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,120
I have the right to do something.

399
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,760
Even if I just stay put like you said,

400
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,000
Tin’s still going to kill me.

401
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,880
He’s taunted us to this extent.

402
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,960
So I’ll counterattack,

403
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,520
by turning this on him with an entrapment.

404
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,760
What’s important

405
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,600
is that we need to keep quiet.

406
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,960
The other cops must not learn of this.

407
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,160
I think, we don’t have to worry about Big Tech interfering.

408
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,040
He’s preparing to turn to politics,

409
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,480
like the media’s been saying nonstop.

410
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,360
Also, seems like the reveal will be at the party’s press conference tomorrow.

411
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,680
That’s good.

412
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,080
It’s convenient for our plan.

413
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,000
If we have lots of police around here,

414
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,480
I fear that Tin’s going to retreat.

415
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,440
[ IT WILL RAIN TOMORROW. ]

416
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,200
Tomorrow’s the last day of the rainy season.

417
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,280
Sky’s gonna be dark all day,

418
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,280
but the rain’s going to get heavy at 7 p.m.

419
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,400
So it means, that Tin’s probably going to act at that time?

420
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,680
Yes!

421
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,960
Tul.

422
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,680
If you actually catch Tin,

423
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,680
and he resists, what will you do?

424
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,280
I’ll do the right thing.

425
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,320
Sorry, Run.

426
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
It's okay, Tul.

427
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,280
I get it.

428
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Even though

429
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,840
you’ve decided,

430
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,800
But I know.

431
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,120
Deep down, you’re still hurt, right?

432
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,920
If you have anything to vent,

433
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,480
you can tell me.

436
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,280
That was the first time that I made it to province level.

437
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,320

438
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,280
At first, I thought no one would come for me.

439
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,160
But in the end,

440
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,880
Tin came.

441
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,480
You still have a family.

442
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
You have me,

443
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360

That’s why I’ve to do everything to protect my family.

446
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,000
I don’t need you to protect me all the time.

447
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,880
I’ll be the one to protect you.

To give up that easily,

Is it possible that he’s turned this on us?

What is so urgent that you need to call reporters in like this?

487
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,960
Does it have to do with the sudden suspension of Inspector Tul?

the truth about the Raindrop Killer case from 18 years ago.

I know that you were dismissed from the forensic team for no reason.

Even though you should’ve been allowed to find your wife’s killer.

494
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,880
I am here to confirm that both Wisut and Arthit

495
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,680
are not the real Raindrop Killers.

496
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,880
They are just scapegoats for the police in a coverup.

497
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,360
Write in the case report that Wisut is the Raindrop Killler.

then he’s the killer.

So he’s a scapegoat?

507
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,240
Wisut’s footprint didn’t match with the actual killer’s.

508
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,440
The patterns were not the same.

509
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,760
Wisut wore shoes bought from a local market,

510
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,360
unlike the killer’s brand shoes.

511
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,040

551
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,080
You think you can control me, huh?!

552
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,480
You should thank me, actually.

553
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,840
For giving you all the promotions.

554
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,360
Tin-

555
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,880
A hero?

556
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,400
You traded your pride for position and money.

557
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,000
Traded away your duty.

558
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,480
Police like you’s no different from a whore, you fuck!

559
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,640
Where the hell are you taking me?

560
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,360
What are you doing?

561
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,280
Where are you taking me?

562
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,720
I said let me go!

563
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,000
Let me go!

564
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,960
Let me go.

565
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,680
What’re you gonna do to me?!

566
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,280
Save your breath, old fuck.

567
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,600
I shouldn’t’ve helped you.

568
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,080
I said shut up!

569
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,640
Got it?

570
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,320
Let me see the medaI!

571
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,920
Here! Gold medal!

572
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,720
Wow!

573
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,680
That’s awesome!

574
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,240
Here! Also got a trophy!

575
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,680
My sister is the best!

576
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,040
I’m so happy you came today!

577
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,520
Of course I came!

578
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,720
My sister’s competing. How could I not come?

579
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,800
How about dad and mom?

580
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,120
Let them be. My support is enough.

581
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,400
Okay?

582
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,360
You’re the best!

583
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,680
Shit.

584
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,240
Tin!

585
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,600
Tul’s phone is off. Her GPS too.

586
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,280
It’s like she doesn’t want us after her.

587
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,560
You think it’s good for us to stay here?

588
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,280
Well,

589
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,640
Maybe we can help Tul if we go.

590
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,920
You are killing a man, Tin.

591
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,120
What you are doing is wrong!

592
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,160
Stop!

593
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,080
Everything is over, Tul.

594
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,360
Truly over.
