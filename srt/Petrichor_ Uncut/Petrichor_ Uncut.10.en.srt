3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,600
Barging into someone’s home like this,

4
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,040
How rude of you.

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,920
Don’t try to distract me.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,440
I don’t have time to argue.

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,200
You are the one who killed Kuljira

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,480
and MP Chutikarn, right?!

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,880
You’re known as the hero. The Raindrop Enforcer.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
But you can’t figure this out yourself?

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,160
Tin.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm warning you now.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Don’t do whatever you plan to do.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,280
Because I can’t be arsed to protect you anymore.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,080
On top of the media and the people,

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,280
that are hounding my men,

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,039
Your sister Tul’s also involved.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,480
You know Tul well yourself.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Know who she is.

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,960
She won’t stop that easily.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,200
That’s just Tul being a good cop.

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,039
She was intent on joining crime suppression.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
Why should I stop her from doing what a cop should do?

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,120
Then if Tul learns that her brother’s a serial killer,

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,320
you won’t have any problem with that?!

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,400
This is my last warning.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
If you don't listen to me,

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,680
then I can’t help you.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,880
Because the person who’s gonna get fucked

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,080
isn’t you,

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,160
isn’t me,

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,080
but it’s Tul!

33
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
She wouldn't pick up!

34
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Let me check.

35
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,760
Damn it.

36
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,880
Tul’s phone is off.

37
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Her GPS too.

38
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,840
It’s like she doesn’t want us after her.

39
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,080
Like she wants to handle this herself.

40
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,320
Even if Tin’s her brother,

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,720
he’s a friggin serial killer!

42
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,080
No way we can let her do this alone.

43
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,200
Can’t you locate her some other way?

44
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,480
What about Big Tech’s guard?.

45
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
He can’t give us anything?

46
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Give me a sec.

47
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
I’ve got nothing.

48
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,920
Fuck, Phu!

49
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,280
If nothing’s working, then

50
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,360
how the hell am I going to find Tul?!

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,080
I don’t fucking know!

52
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,880
What do you want me to do?

53
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,280
Call Big Tech?

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,800
Ask him where Tul is, huh?!

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,680
You are the IT police, dammit!

56
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,280
You wanna just wait for him to send you the location?!

57
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,280
Drink some water, Run.

58
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,280
May.

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
You really think we should just stay here?

60
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,480
Maybe we can help Tul if we go.

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,760
But the inspector told us to stay here.

62
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
If we go and become a burden…

63
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
Better not go, Run.

64
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,040
But I’m worried about Tul.

65
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,080
I know that I won’t be useful.

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,960
But if something happens,

67
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,920
she’ll feel better if I’m there.

68
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,520
Can you promise me?

69
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,520
That if you go,

70
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,800
you’ll just observe and won’t do anything rash?

71
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,360
I don’t make promises that I can’t keep.

72
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,480
How about this,

73
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,400
If you wanna go, go.

74
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,240
But can you wait for Jiu and Phu to get things under control first?

75
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,320
So we know where the inspector is heading.

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,880
The police have not been idle in addressing what has happened,

77
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,680
with both Police Lieutenant General Tech and
Police Major General Pichet.

78
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,159
We have called them in to investigate this happening
and find the truth.

79
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,640
Right now, Pol.Maj.Gen. Pichet is under investigation to verify the facts.

80
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
But to prove our transparency to you all,

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
we have assigned Police Lieutenant General Kwantoon,

82
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
another Assistant Commissioner-General,

83
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,680
to lead the Special Investigation Department for the time being.

84
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,160
Good evening, sir.

85
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,920
You must’ve heard the news about Mr. Tech?

86
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,880
Yes, sir.

87
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,520
The Special Investigation Department is under scrutiny right now.

88
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,880
Especially the Raindrop Killer case.

89
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,680
So the police have sent me to reopen this case.

90
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Who is responsible for this case?

91
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,840
I am, sir.

92
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,159
I, Police Major Dansiam,

93
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,560
head of Special Investigation Unit 2,

94
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,600
is responsible for this case, sir!

95
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,880
From now on,

96
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,880
everything you all do

97
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
must be reported to me directly.

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,680
Acting on your own is forbidden.

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,080
Unit 2, Inspector Dansiam.

100
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,120
You will no longer have anything to do with the Raindrop Killer case.

101
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
I found it.

102
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,680
Big Tech’s location!

103
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Call Inspector Dansiam.

104
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
Yes, Captain Jiu.

105
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,400
Inspector Dansiam,

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,720
I have a lead on the Raindrop Killer.

107
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,480
I also know where he is.

108
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,120
Can you please send back up asap?

109
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,360
I’ll send you the location.

110
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,320
How can you be sure that your lead is legit?

111
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Just believe me!

112
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,360
If it’s not real, Tul won’t be risking herself like this!

113
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,440
What’s the holdup?

114
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,680
Hey, I am not risking any more mess.

115
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I’ve got a mark on my head right now!

116
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I just got ordered to stop my involvement in the Raindrop case!

117
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,800
Inspector,

118
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,120
the person the killer took is Big Tech.

119
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,280
Aren’t you all looking for him?

120
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,120
Fine.

121
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,640
I can report this to my superior.

122
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,080
But I’m telling you,

123
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
if anything goes wrong,

124
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,040
I won’t be responsible for answering any of his questions!

125
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,360
Superior, superior, superior.

126
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,280
Look, you’ve got a higher rank than me.

127
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Can you make yourself useful for once?

128
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,080
Tch.

129
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,480
Excuse me, sir.

130
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
What is it?

131
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,800
Unit 3 sent us intel

132
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
that Mr. Tech might have been abducted by the Raindrop Killer

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
to stir something up.

134
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,440
Right now, Inspector Tul of Unit 3, Big Tech’s daughter is rushing there.

135
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,480
I think that even if this lead may be fake,

136
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,280
we should still send personnel to investigate the given location.

137
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,280
My team has verified the location of Mr. Tech’s phone,

138
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
and it matches what Unit 3 told us.

139
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,880
Then I will send Unit 1 to investigate.

140
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,040
But sir, with the situation like this,

141
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,680
please let me assist as well.

142
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Because my team is ready to move out right away.

143
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,840
So be it.

144
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
But remember,

145
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,120
you will be there only as reinforcement.

146
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,320
Don’t stray again.

147
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,320
There will be no second warning.

148
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,560
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,000
Thanks for getting the location from the Captain, May.

150
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
But Tul’s not found yet, right?

151
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,400
The Inspector’s probably rushing to Big Tech’s location.

152
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,080
Jiu, Phu, and reinforcements are following there.

153
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
Don’t be so worried.

154
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,880
Wait, wait, wait.

155
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,040
I'll drive.

156
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,880
You aren’t fit for it right now.

157
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
Also, I drive a lot faster than you.

158
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
Let’s go!

159
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,280
Ah...

160
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,720
Thought you’d never come.

161
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Good that you still got some wits.

162
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,280
Why are you like this?

163
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,240
Why the hell are you doing this?!

164
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,240
Why am I like this?

165
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,480
You still don’t get it?

166
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,920
The shitty, twisted lives we lived, all because of this fucker!

167
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,720
Even if he did wrong,

168
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,880
you have no right to kill him!

169
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
Tul.

170
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,080
Get a grip.

171
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
I. Kill. Whores!

172
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,240
Those insects that sell their bodies and their souls

173
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
for their own gain. Disgusting!

174
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
They must all die!

175
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
But you are killing people, Tin

176
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,320
What you’re doing is wrong!

177
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,960
Who decides right and wrong, Tul?

178
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,880
What I am doing,

179
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,560
it’s wrong?

180
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,120
How about what they did to my life?

181
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Was it wrong?!

182
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
You think I want to be abandoned?

183
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,440
That I want to have this hard life?

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,880
That I want to become an evil monster like this?!

185
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
Shoot him! Shoot him, Tul!

186
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,160
Shoot him now!

187
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,680
Shoot who, huh?!

188
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,320
He’s gone mad! Shoot him!

189
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,600
Shoot him now!

190
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
Get ahold of yourself, Tin.

191
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
You can still turn back.

192
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,360
I don’t want to hurt you.

193
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,120
Please stop, Tin.

194
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,560
I beg of you.

195
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,880
Freeze!

196
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,480
I said freeze!

197
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,080
The one who should get shot,

198
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
is that me?

199
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,880
You don’t shoot me,

200
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,160
because you think what I’m doing is right, Tul.

201
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,560
You also want this shitty dad gone, don’t you?

202
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,080
Just one smash,

203
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,800
And we will both be free.

204
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
Please stop, Tin.

205
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,760
Or I’ll shoot.

206
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,520
Tin

207
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,040
You are the best brother I have.

208
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,120
The one I trust the most.

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,360
Please come back to me.

210
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,040
Just stop, I beg you.

211
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
I don't want to shoot you.

212
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,680
You think I can stop being who I am

213
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
just on a whim?

214
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,280
I’ve tried.

215
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,280
I just can’t.

216
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,080
So I have to make something out of it like this!

217
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,680
Tul.

218
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,080
Tin, don’t!

219
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,680
Trying to run again, huh?!

220
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
Who's this kid?

221
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,120
What is he doing here?

222
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I…

223
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,880
I don’t know where mom’s gone.

224
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
But Tul is very sick right now.

225
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,800
I need money for the medical bill.

226
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,040
Please, dad.

227
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,920
Whose kid is this?

228
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,640
But you said you don’t have children?

229
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
Aren’t you trying to court my daughter?

230
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,079
How could I have a child?

231
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,280
I’m genuinely serious with your daughter.

232
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,520
This is

233
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
just the son of a former worker I knew.

234
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,720
Probably here for money again.

235
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,000
I helped him once so he’s gotten used to it.

236
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,080
It’s just how the poor’s like.

237
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,120
If he has nothing to do with you, send him away.

238
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,840
What a beggar.

239
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,560
Yes, sir.

240
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,360
Dad!

241
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
Don’t you dare call me dad!

242
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
My new life has started.

243
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,760
I don't have children like you.

244
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,280
Let’s go, boy.

245
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,080
Dad!

246
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,840
Tin.

247
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,920
You are misunderstanding me.

248
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
I, I’ve never hated you.

249
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,560
You hated me!

250
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
You acted like I’m some kind of beggar!

251
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,680
But it’s a whore of a police like you, that’s a beggar!

252
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
If I hated you,

253
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,880
how could I cover for you these 18 years?

254
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,080
I risked my job, my work, everything

255
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,680
for you and Tul.

256
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,840
You’ve gotten away this long

257
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,760
because

258
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,480
I’ve always protected you.

259
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,360
Shut up.

260
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,480
Shut the hell up.

261
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,000
Tul. Do you believe me?

262
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
Tell him who I did it all for?

263
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,680
You didn’t do it for me or anyone!

264
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,080
You did it for yourself!

265
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Acting like you are good police

266
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,880
on that high horse.

267
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,560
But you can’t accept what your own son has done.

268
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,560
All you are good at is sweeping shit under the rug.

269
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,600
Tin, you share my blood.

270
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,040
Every father

271
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,080
love his children.

272
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,800
Lies.

273
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Someone like you speaks nothing but lies!

274
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,880
First time buying?

275
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,680
Let’s have some fun.

276
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,480
You could’ve stopped 18 years ago.

277
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,120
Why’re you doing this again?

278
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,080
Why’d you kill Kuljira and MP Chutikarn?

279
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,160
For what?

280
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,480
They are whores!

281
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,480
Whores, all of them! So disgusting!

282
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,800
Just seeing their faces made me nauseous!

283
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,000
They who sell their dignities are all whores!

284
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Good riddance! Scum!

285
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,920
Actually,

286
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,080
Actually, you almost caught me, Tul.

287
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,480
You’re just a bit too naive.

288
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,440
What do you mean?

289
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Why did you kill Kawin?

290
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
Didn’t you love him?!

291
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,920
It’s just that, he found out that I am the killer.

292
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,800
So he must die.

293
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,360
What about Run’s mother?

294
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,720
Why did you kill her?

295
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
She wasn’t a prostitute.

296
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,280
Didn’t hurt anyone.

297
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,120
Why did you kill her!?

298
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,840
Ah.

299
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,080
Run’s mom?

300
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,880
She was just at the wrong time and place.

301
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,080
Turns out she was the wife of a high ranking surgeon.

302
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,280
So I had to stop.

303
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,480
When I killed her,

304
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
she was still holding a cake.

305
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,480
Shame.

306
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,960
That Dr. Run had to celebrate with mommy’s body.

307
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,520
Shut up!

308
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,040
Tul!

309
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,240
Shoot him already! Shoot him!

310
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,720
If you don't shoot,

311
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,280
he dies.

312
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,320
Go, go, go.

313
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,760
I said stop!

314
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,680
If you wanna be in Crime Suppression,

315
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,040
you gotta be more determined, Tul.

316
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,040
One day you'll be a good cop,

317
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,280
right?

318
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,880
Just not today.

319
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,120
Run, shouldn’t you wait outside?

320
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
It's dangerous in there.

321
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,480
But Tul’s facing danger in there too, May!

322
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,480
But she’s a cop! You’re just a doctor!

323
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,880
Run!

324
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,880
If you wanna shoot, shoot straight, Tul!

325
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,280
I won’t let any shitty cop take credit for this aside from you!

326
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,240
Tul.

327
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,520
Charnwimol.

328
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,400
You are the only one with the right to catch the Raindrop Killer!

329
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,880
Don't you understand?

330
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
No!

331
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,560
Finally.

332
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,840
You did the right thing, Tul.

333
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,280
I thought you would be a stupid cop like dad.

334
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,680
But no.

335
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
You’re smarter.

336
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,480
And more brave.

337
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,720
Tin…

338
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,480
Go, go, go, go!

339
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,640
Tul.

340
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,920
Tul.

341
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,080
Look at me, Tul.

342
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,040
Tul.

343
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm sorry.

344
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,000
That I couldn’t kill Tin.

345
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
I really couldn’t.

346
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,840
It’s alright, Tul.

347
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,280
I don’t blame you one bit.

348
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,280
At least,

349
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,280
you put him in prison.

350
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,760
Everything is over now.

351
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,880
Truly over.

352
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,320
In this era where we all question how the police work,

353
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,360
we must admit that some officers are still dedicated.

354
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,880
Especially Police Major Tul Charnwimol,

355
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,360
who successfully arrested Mr. Tin Charnwimol, the Raindrop Killer,

356
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,440
after receiving a credible lead,

357
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,200
even though the killer shares her blood.

358
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,120
The Special Investigation Department

359
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,880
is gathering evidence to prosecute Tin.

360
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,560
It will be interesting how the police may regain the people’s trust.

361
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,160
Considering how a major case like this

362
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,880
is connected to a high ranking policeman,

363
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,760
and the fact that the real killer walked free for almost 20 years.

364
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,960
Okay!

365
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,880
How was it?

366
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,960
It’s okay.

367
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,440
The last episode got tons of views!

368
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,680
Tiwa, you’re awesome!

369
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,800
Thank you.

370
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,520
My pleasure!

371
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,800
Ah, the boss asked you to interview a guy applying for a job.

372
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,400
It’s said he came from.. SR News!

373
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,000
Who is it?

374
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,680
This one.

375
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,280
It’s Sumet.

376
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,120
My former boss.

377
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,840
Probably got fired without warning as a fall guy for the channel owner.

378
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,680
What a small world!

379
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,960
A man without work ethics

380
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,120
cannot report news well.

381
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,320
Run.

382
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
Have you thought this through, selling this house?

383
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,760
I have, yes.

384
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,680
I can’t take it here for much longer.

385
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,520
Everywhere I look,  there’s only bad memories.

386
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,160
Memories that hurt me.

387
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,880
But this house contains good memories too, right?

388
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,520
Sure, Tin is the Raindrop Killer.

389
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,760
But he also loved and took good care of you here too.

390
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,679
I have something to show you.

391
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,239
If there’s any part that you don’t like,

392
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,760
or any memory you want to forget,

393
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,440
then just erase it.

394
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,400
Shall we create beautiful memories

395
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,719
in this house together?

396
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,720
I’ve been thinking for a while that once everything’s over,

397
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,800
I’ll move in with you for real.

398
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,480
What do you think of me redoing the bakery,

399
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,680
and rebuilding it as our office?

400
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,040
Let's build this house together.

401
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,120
You’re really moving in with me?

402
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,680
I wouldn’t dare ask you to come live with me.

403
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,560
Why are you saying that?

404
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,720
I want to move here myself

405
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,680
You didn’t ask me to.

406
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,680
One more thing.

407
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,520
I can take care of both you and Hed.

408
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,560
Or else I’ll be worried about you two all the time.

409
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,280
I’m serious.

410
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,680
Just, think about it.

411
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,920
Thank you, Run.

412
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,280
These bakery tools,

413
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,320
I’ll donate them to the job training center.

414
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,640
That's good.

415
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,880
I probably won’t use them.

416
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,760
I’lll donate these things too.

417
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,360
You aren’t keeping anything, right?

418
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,440
Well, I’m gonna start fresh.

419
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,240
No use in keeping them.

420
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,480
[ I LOVE TIN THE MOST! ]

421
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
Crybaby.

422
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,000
Heyo, Tul!

423
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,480
Congratulations!

424
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,320
You moved there already, but don’t forget to come buy us food sometimes!

425
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,360
Yeah, Tul!

426
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,520
Come buy me food asap because the flower Jiu picked is so pricey.

427
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,840
I paid half so please come buy me food asap.

428
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,240
- Miss you!
- Miss you, Tul!

429
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,760
See you!

430
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,880
Congrats on your first day on the job, Octospector!
TN: Tul from Tulakhom (October)

431
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,000
Thought I need to die

432
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
before you come visit.

433
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,080
Just kidding.

434
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,040
I got a life sentence anyway.

435
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,800
Doesn’t matter when you come.

436
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,760
But because you’re late,

437
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,080
I get to congratulate you late as well.

438
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,320
Congratulations, Inspector.

439
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
You finally got transferred to Crime Suppression.

440
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,080
Always wanted to work there, yeah?

441
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,560
Plus,

442
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,360
you’re more famous than even the Raindrop Crimebuster.

443
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,640
If I could choose…

444
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,360
This position, I don’t want it.

445
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,160
I want my old brother back.

446
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Happy birthday to you!

447
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,480
Happy birthday to you!

448
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,720
Happy birthday, happy birthday!

449
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,320
Happy birthday to you!

450
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,880
Thank you, thank you.

451
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,120
Come get some cake.

452
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,640
Thank you very much.

453
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,000
Here, for you.

454
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,160
Thank you, Dr. Rak.

455
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,880
Happy birthday!

456
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,080
Thank you so much.

457
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,280
Go already.

458
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,240
Dad and me are gonna talk.

459
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,520
You know me.

460
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,480
Um,

461
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,040
I know that you don’t want cake due to how your mom passed.

462
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,400
But if we don’t leave the past behind,

463
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,280
maybe we won’t be able to move forward.

464
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,000
But everytime I see cakes,

465
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,920
I’d always think of what happened to mom.

466
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,880
I get it.

467
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,640
But I want Run to be happy when thinking of her.

468
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,760
Like this cake.

469
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,480
Run used to love eating them with mom as a kid, right?

470
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,840
She’d probably be glad

471
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,160
to see you happy again.

472
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,960
Hey.

473
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,480
I heard that you’re moving in with Inspector Tul, hm?

474
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,760
Why bring that up now!?

475
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,920
She packed already. Probably leaving soon.

476
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:38,960
Dad.

477
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,720
So,

478
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,120
when’s the wedding?

479
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,920
Is it decided yet?

480
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,640
Tell me quick, so I can get my dress made.

481
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,080
You don’t need to do that.

482
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,960
Who cares about that these days.

483
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,160
Oh? How can you be so sure?

484
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,680
Maybe the Inspector would like to get married with you!

485
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,120
She won’t.

486
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,120
I know her well.

487
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,160
Fine. Whatever you say.

488
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,280
You’ve moved in with her after all!

489
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,960
Just, go wherever. Go!

490
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,360
Hey!

491
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,960
What’s that, Run.

492
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,040
Where’d this cat come from?’

493
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,280
This cat,

494
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,960
I saw her on the roadside while driving home,

495
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,080
but she’s not used to humans yet.

496
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,600
Will it be okay, Run?

497
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,600
The two of us and one cat

498
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,680
are enough trouble already.

499
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,720
There’s so much space left in this house.

500
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
Plus, Hed’s gonna have a new friend too.

501
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,880
But...

502
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,240
we already have Hed, Run.

503
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,880
And we both work long hours.

504
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,440
Will we have time?

505
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,440
Exactly because we’re both busy,

506
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,880
aren’t you worried that Hed might feel lonely?

507
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,240
Just think of her as Hed’s girlfriend.

508
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,320
He’s been alone for a year already.

509
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,560
And he’s been fine.

510
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,200
You can have a girlfriend

511
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,600
but Hed can’t have one too?

512
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,480
How unfair.

513
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,320
Hey. Don’t be sulky.

514
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,760
I named her already.

515
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,240
She’s Somzaa.

516
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,640
I brought her here,

517
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,440
because I thought she looked like you.

518
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,640
Wait a sec.

519
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,280
You already named her too?

520
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,520
No point in asking me then.

521
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,880
Please? Let’s keep her, please?

522
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,720
Please, Tul.

523
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,080
Please, please, please.

524
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,880
Fine.

525
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,200
But if they fight,

526
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,480
that’s on you.

527
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,160
I won’t get involved.

528
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,960
She’ll get used to her eventually. Give her time.

529
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,880
You asked Hed yet?

530
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,440
Hed, may I keep another cat please?

531
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,080
I can? Thank you!

532
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,960
Hed allows it.

533
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,880
Let’s take a family picture.

534
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,160
Congratulations, sweetie.

535
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,920
Thank you.

536
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,960
Doctor?

537
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,720
Let’s go grab a bite to eat. Lots of food that way.

538
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,600
Alright, let’s go

539
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,520
What’s inside?

540
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,240
- Tul!
- I’ve missed you!

541
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,400
Sneaky one, Phu

542
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,040
I miss you so much.

543
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,920
When’re you buying us food, hm?

544
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,840
Yeah, yeah.

545
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,920
Without you I’ve had so much headache.

546
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,600
Listening to Jiu all day’s gonna make me deaf.

547
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,480
You two, can’t you make yourself respectable, hm?

548
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,600
I might be like this,

549
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,480
but at the station, everybody respects me.
Just a bit away from calling me ‘Sir’.

550
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,680
Oyyy! Don’t take him too seriously.

551
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,440
Time changes, and people change so much too,

552
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,400
but only you are still a braggart as always.

553
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,880
Oyyy! You talk so much, it’s smelling of plaques.

554
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,520
The hell are you on about?

555
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,760
Hey, do you know that every day,

556
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,840
I have to put up with Inspector Dansiam’s bullshit,

557
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,720
and then this guy’s dumbness too.

558
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,800
Act grown up already.

559
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,880
Yeah.

560
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,640
Just let it be. It’s true that Inspector Dansiam’s a bit annoying,

561
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,080
but with guidance to keep him straight, I think he’ll do his job pretty well.

562
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,440
Even though he once strayed and believed that,

563
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,920
being a cop means sucking up and selling out.

564
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,880
Well, you can say that. Because you don’t work there anymore.

565
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,680
Oh?

566
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,440
I miss you a fair bit, Jiu.

567
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,760
Ah, my hair!

568
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,320
Noo, help me!

569
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,640
I even tied it up from home.

570
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,680
Without you it’s quite lonely.

571
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,920
Wire me a few, man. If you won’t come, please wire us..

572
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,480
Yep. If you don’t wanna come with us then wire us so we can go eat.

573
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,920
Thank you, Dr. Rak,

574
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,120
for allowing Run to live here.

575
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,440
Even though my family was behind all the troubles.

576
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,920
All that’s in the past. Let it go.

577
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,080
You aren’t the same as your family.

578
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,760
I’m glad

579
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,400
that you and Run got together in the end.

580
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,880
From now on, the only thing I ask of you,

581
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,800
is to take care of Run as well as I did.

582
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,080
I might not be sure about anything else.

583
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,760
But this I swear.

584
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,720
I will take care of Run the best I can.

585
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,360
Better than taking care of myself.

586
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,280
I believe that.

587
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,080
And, in case anything happens,

588
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,480
please remember that you and Run have me here.

589
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,200
And from now on,

590
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,760
please consider yourself my daughter as well.

591
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,400
You can tell me anything, my girl.

592
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,600
We are the same family now.

593
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,480
Thank you,

594
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
Father.

595
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,600
I envy Tul and Run. They’re so in love.

596
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,280
Why envy them?

597
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,560
Aren’t we in love as well?

598
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,440
It’s not like that.

599
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,920
It’s… I envy how they wake up to each other every day.

600
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,360
But when you wake up, you call me first thing anyway, yeah?

601
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,280
May

602
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,040
You know what I mean, I’m sure.

603
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,160
How can I know?

604
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,920
I’m not one to jump to conclusions.

605
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,080
May.

606
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,480
Alright.

607
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,400
No more teasing.

608
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,760
Whose home are we moving to?

609
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,040
Yours or mine?

610
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,200
Either one’s good. All your choices are fine by me.

611
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,880
My home then.

612
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,960
It’s close to both our workplaces.

613
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,040
Deal.

614
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,560
Ah, one more thing.

615
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,520
I won’t cook nor do houseworks at all.

616
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,520
Hired help only. Got it?

617
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,880
Roger that!

618
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,680
Just sit back and relax. I’ll spoil you rotten. I’ll take care of it all.

619
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,160
I told you, you don’t have to.

620
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,200
Hired help only.

621
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,960
Work’s so tiring already.

622
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,840
Okay, as you say.

623
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,280
Your choice’s mine as well.

624
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,960
Enough!

625
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,280
Too much! Too much!

626
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,160
Enough already!

627
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,080
Tul, you okay?

628
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,080
Tired?

629
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,080
I just, think it’s a bit hot. No worries.

630
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,280
Ah, Run.

631
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,320
Today

632
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,560
were you happy?

633
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,680
Of course.

634
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,840
Seeing everyone together again,

635
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,440
I miss that feeling.

636
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,320
It’s good that you’re happy.

637
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,680
Tul.

638
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,600
Huh?

639
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,160
What’s up with you?

640
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,760
You can tell me anything.

641
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,360
Well,

642
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,320
nothing.

643
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,880
Tul.

644
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,080
Is something up? Seriously.

645
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,720
Spit it out.

646
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,680
I…

647
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,680
Marry me, Run.

648
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,720
You wanna marry me?

649
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,360
But,

650
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,560
if you want to stay like this for now, it’s okay.

651
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,720
Just having you,

652
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,680
and Hed,

653
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,320
and Somzaa here is enough.

654
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,720
Statuses aren’t so important.

655
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,360
Well, Tul...

656
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,000
You can give it straight.

657
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,080
I get it.

658
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,560
I’m grown up now.

659
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,880
I just, want to do things right.

660
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,120
Don’t overthink it.

661
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,840
Come up.

662
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:31,960
Hey!

663
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,600
You frightened me there!

664
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,600
Thought you didn’t wanna marry me.

665
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,480
Why would I not want to?

666
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,400
What I was upset about:

667
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,960
you beat me to the proposal!

668
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,240
I was gonna propose tomorrow

669
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,080
I wanted to count tomorrow as our day one

670
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,840
together till we’re old.

671
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,880
Thank you, Run.

672
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,960
So pretty.

673
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,160
And it fits well.

674
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,080
Tul.

675
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,480
Sorry.

676
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,320
We're married now.

677
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,280
Thank you

678
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,200
for becoming my happiness.

679
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:29,360
Even though you are a bit obstinate, headstrong, and blunt.

680
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,800
Still, I love you the most.

681
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,760
Um,

682
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,800
Please continue being my Tul

683
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,480
for me to love forever, okay?

684
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,720
Thank you for coming into my life too.

685
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,360
I promise,

686
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,240
that I’ll love

687
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,640
and care for you your whole life.

688
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,840
My little Run.

689
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,720
Tul, do you know?

690
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,520
Ever since the first time you invite me to dinner as thanks,

691
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:27,000
we’ve never had a formal dinner together.

692
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,520
It’s good that we haven’t.

693
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,160
Well, I didn’t wanna dine out as a friend.

694
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,240
I’d prefer dining like this.

695
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,680
As a couple.

696
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,400
Well.

697
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,520
Yeah.

698
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,080
Oh, why not drink?

699
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,840
Well, there’s a pattern.

700
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,080
I’m afraid I’ll get called in if I drink.

701
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,920
How about you? Not drinking?

702
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,480
Just in case.

703
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,280
But I told the department,

704
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,640
that if it’s not necessary,

705
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,000
I’m not going to any scenes

706
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,320
I think it’ll be fine.

707
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,080
Shall we celebrate to the fullest?

708
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,680
Cheers!

709
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,280
Oh!

710
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,880
Let’s run, Doctor Run.

711
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,960
Let this Octospector take you to the scene.
