3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,080
It's been reported that

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,640
on yesterday evening,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,680
a young woman's body was found

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,600
in a bush.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,080
The 28-year-old female victim was a bank employee.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,560
Her name is

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,240
Ploypapas Arunosree.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,680
I'm afraid this case will be similar to

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,000
the case that happened 18 years ago,

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,560
the 'Raindrop Killer' case.

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,680
The police are not ignoring the seriousness of

14
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,800
what has happened.

15
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,800
We have formed a special investigation team

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,560
to seek for the truth behind this case.

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,040
Police Major General Pichet

18
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,320
will be in charge of this case.

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,120
What about the news reporting that the serial killer

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,440
from 18 years ago

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
has just been released from prison the other day?

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,320
Is that true?

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,640
It's true.

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,440
But right now we haven't found any linkage between
 what has happened with that case.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,440
The police are gathering all evidence

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,440
and will proceed with the investigation as quickly as possible.

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,920
The killer’s methods are similar to 18 years ago.

28
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,200
So, you already knew these two cases may be connected, right?

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,079
Yes.

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,440
Are you okay?

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,600
Do you feel better?

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,600
The victim’s face was struck multiple times with a blunt object.

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,320
There are many wounds;  her skull 's fractured above the left ear.

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,480
Please cut the knot too.

35
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,920
Please check all the blood traces, and then don't forget to

36
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,000
collect her DNA, too.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Pack her up.

38
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,240
You don't look well.

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,440
Why don't take a short break from work?

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,320
It's okay. I'm fine.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
Are you sure?

42
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Well, if you collapse,

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,480
I probably can't help you in time.

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,320
I told you I'm fine.

45
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
And one more thing,

46
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,320
we're at the hospital,

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,920
If something happen to me,

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,080
I don't need your help.

49
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,880
A murder happened after the killer's just been released like this,

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,240
the investigation team must be swamped right now.

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Inspector.

52
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,520
If the killer is the same person with

53
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
the case 18 years ago,

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,680
why is he still using the same method?

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
He should've known that

56
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
he will get caught.

57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,200
In this world,

58
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,720
some criminals lack self-control, and sometimes they get too confident.

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,640
They might think they are better,

60
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
smarter,

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,800
and the police will not be able to catch them again.

62
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,440
Time spent in prison

63
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,840
doesn't always help everyone become a better man.

64
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
Those 18 years

65
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,040
might not have changed the killer at all.

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
Whatever.

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,720
It’s not like there’s much to expect from this country anyway.

68
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,640
Just think of it as renting the place to live.

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,680
Tul,

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,400
the Commander just called for an urgent meeting.

71
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,680
I need to go.

72
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,160
I'll be right back.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
You don't have to come back.

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
If the autopsy results are out,

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,080
I'll let people take them to you.

76
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,240
Nah, I'll be right back.

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
The CCTV footage shows that

78
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
after the victim's time of death,

79
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,560
there's a footage of Wisut walking along the road near the crime scene.

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
And if you compare this case to the case that happened

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
18 years ago,

82
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,800
I think

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,840
these two cases are very similar.

84
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,000
Judging from all the evidence we've gathered,

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,640
Wisut is our prime suspect.

86
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
So you guys

87
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,760
go after Wisut for interrogation.

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
I'll send another team to help.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,640
This case has the public's attention,

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,320
so we must act swiftly to catch the suspect.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,760
Commander, sir.

92
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,160
I got to the scene first.

93
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
And I just ordered Captain  and Sergeant Phu

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,280
to find more evidence and witnesses.

95
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,560
Won't it be faster for my team to take this case?

96
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,960
And let you embarrass me like what you did with Wasan's case, huh?

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,560
Apologies, sir.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,280
But if we had reported that as an accident to the media,

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,960
then later corrected it as a homicide,

100
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,360
wouldn't our department’s credibility look worse?

101
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
You'll investigate, or find any evidence, go ahead.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,440
But you must not interfere with others' team work.

103
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,920
If you find anything, just report directly to Dansiam.

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,640
Do you have any problems?

105
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
No, sir.

106
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,080
If this can help catch the killer,

107
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I'm willing to cooperate.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,920
That's good.

109
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,920
According to the 18-year-old case file,

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,680
Wisut Saenjaisue was the killer.

111
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,480
Wisut was a taxi driver.

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,920
All his victims were his passengers, specifically
from the red-light district.

113
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,280
Each case shows the killer becoming more precise and composed,

114
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,680
especially in the later ones.

115
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,480
It looked like he was calmer and neater.

116
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,440
Um,

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
from what I've found,

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,720
the consistent patterns are the smashed faces,

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
bound hands with green rope tied in a specific knot,

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
and all of these happened in rainy night.

121
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,840
The crime scene will always be

122
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,840
some abandoned areas.

123
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,800
But the pattern isn’t consistent across all cases.

124
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,480
Like the last case,

125
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
the victim wasn’t in the sex industry.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
And the doctor assigned for the autopsy

127
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
had also been changed in the last two cases.

128
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,440
This case was very famous back then.

129
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,680
Big Tech went from an ordinary cop,

130
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,760
to become a celebrity officer,

131
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,960
praised for his relentless pursuit of the killer.

132
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,640
I think Big Tech just want to wrap up the case cleanly,

133
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,400
so he rush to capture Wisut.

134
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,039
Closing the case would’ve been his victory.

135
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
Don't pay attention to someone like him.

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,160
Let’s focus on doing our jobs.

137
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,480
In the meantime,

138
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,040
you two try contacting the victims’ families or acquaintances.

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,840
If you find anything, tell me.

140
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,920
Happy now?

141
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,080
Sorry.

142
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,400
Thank you.

143
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,560
Seriously, have you never been in the autopsy room before?

144
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,840
Why didn’t you dress up properly?

145
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,640
I'm just in a hurry.

146
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
I'm sorry, Doc.

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,480
Do all doctors carry these many pins on their heads?

148
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,240
Just in case someone like you shows up unprepared.

149
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,840
Ready?

150
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,240
Yes.

151
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,800
Have you two eaten?

152
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,880
Not yet, but I'm getting hungry, though.

153
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,800
Okay.

154
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,320
After finishing this case, let's order something.

155
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,840
Same place as usual, right? Offal soup?

156
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,880
Yeah, that shop is good.

157
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,440
That shop's offal is fresh—no fishy smell.

158
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,560
The heart and liver are super tender.

159
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
Okay, I'll order that for you.

160
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,760
For someone who's always ready to fight,
I haven't thought you'd be scared of anything, Inspector.

161
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,720
Well, Doctor,

162
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,320
not everyone has nerves of steel like you,
especially considering you've been working here for years.

163
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,800
Don't look at her as a dead body.

164
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,760
Think of her as someone who we need to seek for the truth for.

165
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,120
Or should I call someone else to replace you?

166
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,040
Stich it up.

167
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Noted!

168
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay. We'll take care of it.

169
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
Look at this.

170
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,120
Though the rope used

171
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
is also green,

172
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,120
some characteristics are different.

173
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,440
The knot-tying method is different too.

174
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,040
The cases from 18 years ago

175
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,360
showed three loops before tying a knot,

176
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,320
but this one only has two.

177
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,120
I looked at the cases 18 years ago,

178
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,040
aside from the similar rope knot

179
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
there are still many points that are obviously different.

180
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
You...

181
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,240
actually went back to read the old cases?

182
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,360
If the cases are related, it helps with the autopsy comparison.

183
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,320
For instance, in this case of Ploypapas,

184
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,640
it’s clear the pattern differs because Ploypapas was struck
with a blunt object randomly around her skull,

185
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,520
unlike the past victims who were struck precisely at Pterion.

186
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,520
Pterion?

187
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,720
Wait.

188
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,200
What is Pterion? Is it a medical term?

189
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,640
It's this point,

190
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,600
where four plates of the skull converge.

191
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,520
A blow here can damage major arteries,

192
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,840
causing brain hemorrhage and death.

193
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,440
Then, it looks like

194
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,760
the killer is more careless and rushed, right?

195
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,840
After killing seven victims,

196
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
he should be more skilled, shouldn't he?

197
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,240
Do you

198
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
really think it's the same killer?

199
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,800
Tul,

200
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,360
I've seen you working hard lately,

201
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
so I went to buy some vitamins for you.

202
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,120
It's okay. I'm good.

203
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,120
Thank you, Inspector.

204
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,200
You should keep it for yourself.

205
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,960
Hey, I already have a lot.

206
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,720
Please, don't worry about it—

207
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,640
just accept my care for you.

208
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,840
Thank you, Inspector.

209
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,440
I'll just take the care you’re offering, nothing else.

210
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,520
Nah. Come on.

211
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
Keep it youself, please.

212
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,160
How long do I have to wait for you two?

213
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,160
Phu.

214
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,320
The last time the victim was found

215
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,600
is around 5:40 p.m.

216
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,200
She left work late because she had to report on bank debtors.

217
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,600
Afterward, she headed home.

218
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,800
Colleagues stated they didn’t notice anything unusual,

219
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,640
and Ploypapas herself didn’t seem to have conflicts with anyone.

220
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,760
So what about autopsy reports?

221
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,960
The autopsy results come out that

222
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,440
the victim died because of multiple blows to the head with a blunt object.

223
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,160
However, when compared to the M.O. from 18 years ago,
there are some differences.

224
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,040
For instance, the knot used in tying ropes is different,

225
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,840
the location of the blows varies,

226
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,240
and there’s no evidence of sexual motivation, unlike previous victims.

227
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,599
Because she was not a sex worker.

228
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,520
This suggests the killer might not be the same person from 18 years ago.

229
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,359
It's good that you're observant.

230
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,680
But I think the killer might be in a hurry this time.

231
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,760
The whole pattern is the same.

232
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,280
Besides, if the killer is really someone else.

233
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,040
What is the motive of the murder?

234
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,680
Can you answer that?

235
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,480
Given Ploypapas' profession as a bank employee

236
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,680
specializing in debt collection and negotiation,

237
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,000
she often had to meet lots of people,

238
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,960
and possibly led to a fight.

239
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
I think it might be possible that

240
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,160
someone held a grudge against her and decided to kill her.

241
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,240
If someone want to flee their debt, why go through the trouble of killing her

242
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,160
They can simply disappear and avoid being contacted.

243
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,640
I don't think the killer is a bank debtor.

244
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,920
Before saying anything, there must be evidence first, right?

245
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,840
We're gonna have to catch Wisut first.

246
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,320
If you want to come up with any alternative theory, fine,

247
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,880
but Wisut still fits the profile better than your speculation.

248
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,480
But as long as we don't have any solid evidence,

249
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,960
we can't assume that Wisut is guilty.

250
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,920
Don't eat again, huh?

251
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,760
You're so hard to please,  quickly!

252
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
It's weird.

253
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,440
What have I done wrong?

254
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Tul.

255
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,840
Look, Hed just ate another goldfish.

256
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,480
The fish was minding its own business in the bow.

257
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,240
Hed!!!

258
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,800
This is too much! You are so spoiled. Bad habit!

259
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,960
The fish didn’t do anything to you!

260
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,040
You can't kill for fun.

261
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,080
Next time, I’ll turn you into spicy stir-fried cat meat.

262
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,320
No wonder she doesn't look me in the eye today.

263
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,880
What should we do?

264
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,320
Should we stop keeping goldfish.

265
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,920
I think she will eat them again.

266
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,480
It’s fine. I’ll get a cover for the bowl so Hed can’t reach.

267
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,880
Don't eat anything then.

268
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,480
See, how can I complain about anything?

269
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,600
I’m sulking now.

270
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,720
Here, try these.

271
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,840
I made two versions. Taste it for me.

272
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,040
How is it different?

273
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,400
Well, taste it and you'll lknow.

274
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,440
I don't see any difference.

275
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,400
How's the texture?

276
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,760
I haven't eaten yet!

277
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,840
Let me try another one.

278
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,960
What is this called?

279
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
Cheese pie.

280
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,440
Scoop in the bottom too.

281
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,480
Okay.

282
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,760
I like the right one.

283
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,200
It's sweeter.

284
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
This one is too sour.

285
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
I think...

286
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,840
this is the right one.

287
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,400
You trust me?

288
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,680
Well, there are only the two of us. If I don't trust you,

289
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,480
there is no one left.

290
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,640
Tin.

291
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,720
What's wrong?

292
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,040
Why are you so clingy today?

293
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,640
It's been rough today, right?

294
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,120
Is it about the case?

295
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,680
I clashed with my boss today.

296
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,720
I just want to do what's right.

297
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,520
But no one understands me.

298
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,880
If you think you're doing the right thing,

299
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,040
just do it then. Don't think too much.

300
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,680
But don't forget to be careful.

301
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,520
Okay?

302
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,480
I wish I could stay like this forever.

303
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,640
Quit, then. I'll take care of you.

304
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,640
Ugh, if I really quit, you'll shiver in fear.

305
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,600
Oh, come on. Give me all the shivers.

306
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,680
You can't really handle me.

307
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,520
I snack all day.

308
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,520
I've a shop full of desserts;

309
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,920
you can eat all you want.

310
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,680
This feels like I am recharging, Tin.

311
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
You little devil.

312
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,000
Tiwa,

313
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,720
I've heard that the interns were reworking content like crazy today.

314
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,720
What happened?

315
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,640
Did you snap at them?

316
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,400
They asked some inappropriate questions.

317
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,800
The woman just lost her daughter, and they pressed on her feelings like that.

318
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,840
So I told them to redo the interview completely.

319
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,400
It’s good to keep them in line,

320
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,760
and I understand why you don't want to dramatize the news

321
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
but remember,

322
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
viewers don’t want complicated news.

323
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,080
Just keep it simple

324
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,240
and avoid stepping on the police’s toes. We don’t need trouble.

325
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,480
Ah, don’t give me that look.

326
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,160
Remember the Siraphob's case?

327
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,080
I barely survived that one.

328
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,240
He is the owner of the station. Don't forget that.

329
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,080
Look like

330
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,640
you want to keep digging up Big Tech, right?

331
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,000
And why did you keep defending him?

332
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,120
I don't really want to support him.

333
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
His network is backed by major sponsors.

334
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,720
The station’s owner is also close to him.

335
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,280
Come on.

336
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,440
Focus on surrounding angles. No need to ask the police.

337
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,720
Talk to relatives,

338
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,800
play up the drama. Got it?

339
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,640
Yes.

340
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,240
I got it.

341
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,240
Hey, I’m saying this for your own good.

342
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,760
You’re one of the few rising women in this channel.

343
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,800
Do you know that?

344
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,240
Yeah, I know.

345
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,160
Good!

346
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,200
THE RAINDROP KILLER; THE SERIAL KILLER IN 2006

347
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
WATCHARIN TRAKULWIPATKUL

348
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,640
Oh, !

349
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,840
Oh, May!

350
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,560
What are you doing here?

351
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,600
You're here for autopsy reports?

352
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,440
Yes!

353
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,000
I heard that forensics police found traces of blood and tissue on the rope,

354
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,200
so I came to check the test results.

355
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,320
What case?

356
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,120
Ploypapas?

357
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,800
Yeah, are they ready?

358
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,240
But I already sent everything to Run.

359
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,800
If you want more details, go ask her, not me.

360
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,440
Seriously, apart from wandering around,

361
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,280
do you ever work?

362
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,840
I do work!

363
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
But cops are busy, you know.

364
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,080
We don’t always get to talk.

365
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,080
By the way, have you eaten?

366
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm hungry.

367
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,600
I haven't eaten anything since morning.

368
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,240
If you're that hungry, go eat something then.

369
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,840
What, are you asking me out?

370
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
If I did, will you go?

371
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,400
No.

372
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,640
And if you’re trying to rekindle anything,

373
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
then stop it.

374
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,760
I’ve already told you,

375
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,040
just focusing on being colleagues is enough now.

376
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,120
I don’t want to talk about the past.

377
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,800
Hi, May.

378
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,560
Hello, Tiwa.

379
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,360
Are you here for Run?

380
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,760
Oh, I better get going then.

381
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,280
Um,

382
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,040
I just wanted to ask if Run is okay.

383
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,040
I heard the police are reopening old cases from 18 years ago.

384
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,800
I’m worried about her.

385
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
Honestly, she’s not doing great.

386
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
But you know Run.

387
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,440
She’s tough. A true iron lady of the forensic lab.

388
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,080
Still, I think it’s best to give her some space for now.

389
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,840
She probably wants to be alone.

390
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,920
Doing this is right. Right, Mom?

391
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Here you go.

392
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,640
Eat up!

393
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,840
Oh!

394
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,240
So you aren’t quitting anymore?

395
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,120
At first I almost gave up.

396
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,840
But someone stopped me.

397
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,760
My girl, someone managed to stop you?

398
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,920
You're exaggerating, Dad.

399
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,520
At first I was really hesitated of what I should do.

400
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,520
until the case of Ploypapas came in.

401
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,800
Are you sure you can handle this case?

402
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,840
I'm fine, Dad.

403
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,120
You know well that there are many strange things

404
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,440
about the case 18 years ago.

405
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,720
I want to find out the truth.

406
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,840
And besides,

407
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,040
it feels like I’m getting closer to mom,

408
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,640
and getting to know her better.

409
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,400
I'm afraid that this case

410
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,720
might stir up something inside you.

411
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,760
If it ever becomes too much,

412
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,480
promise me you’ll tell me,

413
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,440
understand?

414
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,560
Dad.

415
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,320
I'm a doctor now!

416
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,040
Not a little kid anymore.

417
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,440
I know.

418
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
But for me you will always be

419
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,720
my little girl forever.

420
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,280
I'm gonna eat it all!

421
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,920
Doctor.

422
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,960
The police have caught Wisut.

423
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,040
They're investigating him.

424
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,040
Can I have some water? I'm thirsty.

425
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,400
What the fuck?

426
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,120
You think this is hotel, huh?

427
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,920
The moment I got your DNA test,

428
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,640
you are fucking done.

429
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,120
Listen to me,

430
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,840
You have no alibi.

431
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,440
And the M.O. is similar to what you did in the past.

432
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,560
All the evidence is stacked against you.

433
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,680
How long are you going to keep lying?

434
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,120
Have you ever thought about those women you've killed?

435
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,400
Just because you got angry, you could kill them?!

436
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,200
Huh?!

437
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,560
Inspector, you keep accusing me of doing it.

438
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,760
But do you have any evidence?

439
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,240
Where’s this DNA you’re talking about?

440
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,520
Just show it to my face.

441
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,640
But if you don't, just say it.

442
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,640
Listen.

443
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,400
If you don't confess now,

444
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,200
your sentence will only get worse.

445
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,960
Or do you want to rot in jail for another twenty years?

446
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,720
What's your name, Inspector?

447
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,640
Look like a manly name.

448
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,880
But Inspector, I didn’t expect

449
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
you’d be the type

450
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,400
to bark

451
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,400
but don't bite.

452
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,320
Inspector!

453
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,000
Do you want me to question you again?

454
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,520
So, this is how cops interrogate?

455
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,360
You all graduated from the same school, huh?

456
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Inspector! Stop it!

457
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,120
There’s a camera in this room.

458
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,440
I know I shouldn’t interfere,

459
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
but at the very least,

460
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,400
you should respect the suspect’s basic rights during interrogation.

461
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,880
Not to physically assault a suspect like this.

462
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,560
Mr. Wisut, sir.

463
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,800
I'm begging you.

464
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,040
If you confess now,

465
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,640
I'll push for a lighter sentence for you.

466
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,200
Or do you want me to interrogate you over and over?

467
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,000
I'll give you one last chance.

468
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,680
I already told you.

469
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,840
If there are evidence,

470
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,240
I won't be able to escape anyway.

471
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,720
Inspector!

472
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,320
Let's talk outside.

473
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,320
Tul, you saw it, right?

474
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,800
That bastard's playing games to mess with us.

475
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,240
He’s definitely the one who did it.

476
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,440
I get it, Inspector.

477
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,520
But you need to calm down.

478
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
We still don't have any evidence to charge him yet.

479
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,120
There are many cases where the killer is released ,
and then repeat the crime again.

480
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,200
He may be a psychopath and go back to do it again.

481
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
If you think he's mentally ill,

482
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,400
shouldn't we send him to see a doctor?

483
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,440
Rather then using violence like this.

484
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,120
The Commander has told me

485
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,120
many years ago that

486
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,200
Wisut is always like this.

487
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,080
Not confessing so easily.

488
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,520
But I'll come up with some evidence to nail him this time.

489
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,560
Hey!

490
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
Fabricating evidence?

491
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,240
No, Inspector. That's not right!

492
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,040
Inspector Tul,

493
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,040
we need to close the case just like we're ordered,

494
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,680
so that Big Tech and the Commander won't keep bothering you.

495
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,800
You...

496
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
just don't go against them too much.

497
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,680
Inspector,

498
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,520
If you want to be a bootlicker

499
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,560
I won't.

500
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm saying this because I care about you.

501
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,280
Besides me,

502
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
who's gonna protect you?

503
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
I didn't want anyone to protect me.

504
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
I've always done everything by myself.

505
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,800
Are you really sure

506
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,159
that you’ve never used any connections to get where you are?

507
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,400
You can think or say whatever you want.

508
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,239
But if I had to fabricate evidence framing Wisut,

509
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,280
I'd rather not following that kind of unjust order.

510
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,719
Can you please help me?

511
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,480
Please, help me.

512
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,320
My daughter's disappeared.

513
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,040
No one cares about me.

514
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,880
Please, could you help me.

515
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,760
Uncle, please calm down.

516
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,040
This isn’t a place to file a missing person report.

517
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,240
I’ve already reported it to the local police, but no one seems to care!

518
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,120
Go. I'll take care of it.

519
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
Stay calm please.

520
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,120
How can I stay calm!?

521
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,720
My daughter is missing.

522
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,720
A small girl out there by her own!.

523
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,960
I don’t know if she’s alive or dead by now.

524
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
What's going on?

525
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,320
This man came to report his missing daughter.

526
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,400
The local police just accept the case but don't do anything.

527
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,120
Is there anything we can do

528
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,880
to help him?

529
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,520
Tul.

530
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,840
I think we better let the local police handle it.

531
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,560
They already dislike us enough as it is.

532
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,440
I’ll refer the case back to them.

533
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,600
I know,

534
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,040
but can’t we at least take his report?

535
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,440
Commander, sir.

536
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,640
Actually, you can take this case if you want, Inspector.

537
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,160
Technically the Special Investigation Division

538
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,600
has the authority to expand inquiries into missing person cases.

539
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,920
I’ll talk to the local police for you.

540
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,880
Focus on this case for now

541
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,520
and put the Ploypapas' case on hold.

542
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,840
Commander?

543
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,920
I can handle two cases at the same time.

544
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,920
I don’t think that chasing two hares is appropriate.

545
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,240
Focus on this one first.

546
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,280
Look at him.

547
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,880
Poor man!

548
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,920
If you don't help people in need, then it will make you
look like you don't have any empathy.

549
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,040
But it’s your call. Do whatever you want.

550
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,600
Yes, Commander.

551
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,240
I'll take care of this case.

552
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,520
From what I've gathered Yardpirun worked as a hostess at a bar.

553
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,480
and after scholling on her instagram,

554
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,840
she lived a very flamboyant lifestyle.

555
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,280
Eating with elites,

556
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,640
and her Instagram has a lot of followers.

557
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,120
Seems like she’s pretty well-known.

558
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,400
According to her father,

559
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,680
she usually goes to work at night and come home by dawn.

560
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,840
But on the morning she went missing, he couldn't contact her.

561
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,920
Her father searched everywhere but found nothing.

562
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,360
Alright. You two head to the bar where she worked

563
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,840
and talk to her coworkers.

564
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,520
If anyone has any leads, tell me.

565
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,600
Copy that!

566
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,440
Sorry.

567
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,320
TRAKULWIPATKUL

568
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,880
…such as this last case.

569
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,240
the victim was not a sex worker.

570
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,200
Doc,  are you busy?

571
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,320
I’m just reviewing some research papers—not too much going on.

572
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,120
Why? What brings you here?

573
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,680
I came to return your hair tie and clip.

574
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,120
Thank you so much.

575
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,640
You went all the way here just to returen these?

576
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,400
You can take them. I have plenty.

577
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,440
Don’t you police have things to do?

578
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,360
Not like that.

579
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,240
But I've been assigned to handle another case.

580
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,640
It's a missing person case.

581
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,400
I have to look for more information.

582
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,120
And... well, I want to check on you.

583
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,640
Check on me?

584
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,720
You said you had so little rest.

585
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,440
And then...

586
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,480
you look a bit off whenever we talk about the case 18 years ago.

587
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,400
The surname of the last victim

588
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,800
and the surname of the forensic doctor who handled earlier cases...

589
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,200
it's the same as yours, isn't it?

590
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,320
Look, but if you don't want me to talke about it,

591
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,120
It's okay.

592
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,440
I understand.

593
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,040
I'm asking because I'm worried about you.

594
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,880
But if it makes you uncomfortable,

595
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,480
I won't bring it up again.

596
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,080
Actually, it's not a secret.

597
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
The last victim of the Raindrop Killer

598
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,080
is my mother.

599
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,640
And the forensic doctor

600
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,640
is Dr. Rak, my father.

601
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,040
But...

602
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,480
my dad was suddenly replaced by someone else in the last two cases.

603
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
You...

604
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,040
I'm okay.

605
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,480
It's been a long time.

606
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,880
It's just... there are some questions I need to figure out.

607
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,240
I hope you understand, Inspector.

608
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,520
Doctor.

609
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,640
I'll help you.

610
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,640
I'll find out all the truth in the past.

611
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,640
From now on, you don't have to carry it all alone anymore.

612
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,440
You can tell me everything.

613
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,440
That's a bold thing to say, Inspector.

614
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,640
But if you can actually do it,

615
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,680
I’ll be very grateful.

616
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
, what's up?

617
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,600
Tul.

618
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,240
Someone found a mysterious girl's body in a suitcase by the river.

619
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,520
It's the area near Rama 6 Bridge.

620
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,520
Based on the initial findings...

621
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,160
I think it’s probably the person we’ve been looking for.

622
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,080
I'll be there soon.

623
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,760
Tul!

624
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,840
The witness who found the body said

625
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,760
he usually fishes here often.

626
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,720
He spotted a suitcase floating in the water and opened it,

627
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,240
only to find a dismembered body inside.

628
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,280
Though it's hard to see her face clearly,

629
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,040
we suspect it’s Yardpirun.

630
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,560
You've checked everything, right?

631
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,600
Yes, ma'am.

632
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,840
The body is bloated,

633
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,440
Eyes bulging, tongue swollen.

634
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,600
The skin has turned a greenish.

635
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,480
She's been dead for three days.

636
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,320
Full Decomposition.

637
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,360
There’s Subconjunctival Hemorrhage,

638
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,680
which could be a sign of asphyxia.

639
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
There's a butterfly-shaped tattoo on the right wrist.

640
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,160
Take a picture, please.

641
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,040
There's a wooden bit under her fingernail.

642
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
Forceps, please.

643
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,840
Pack the body and send to Forensics.

644
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,720
From the autopsy,

645
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,800
I found traces of sexual intercourse.

646
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,440
So I've swabbed her vagina to collect some sperm samples.

647
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,120
And I also found a piece of wood under her fingernail.

648
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,440
So I sent it for testing.

649
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,440
I hope that we get DNA results maybe from the vagina or fingernail.

650
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,200
May I reveal the body?

651
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,440
The body is starting to decompose,

652
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,640
thus, making it difficult to confirm the identity.

653
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,440
Still, we want the relatives to confirm her identity.

654
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,000
Yes, it's her.

655
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,800
This's my daughter.

656
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,080
Yardpirun.

657
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,640
I think that's enough for today.

658
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,720
Please bring her father out for some rest.

659
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,440
Mr. Karun, this way please.

660
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,720
Inspector?

661
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,640
Did you request a DNA test for her family members?

662
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,640
Yes, I did.

663
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,680
Did you suspect anything?

664
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,880
No.

665
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,320
It's good that you've requested.

666
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,440
Tul.

667
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,800
Phu, what's up?

668
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,320
I managed to recover data from Yardpirun’s iCloud.

669
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,840
The thing is

670
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,680
actually, aside from her job entertaining at bars,

671
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,720
she also worked privately with high-profile clients.

672
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,160
Uh, uh,

673
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,400
And then...

674
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,600
the last person she talked to

675
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,400
is...

676
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,440
Phu, just spill it.

677
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,800
Everyone here is involved in the case.

678
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,240
The last client she met before she disappeared was…

679
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,040
this person.

680
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,040
He is...

681
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,640
Jay, that famous singer who just  released a single.

682
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,920
He is on the rise.

683
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,520
Well, this case is getting bigger than I thought.

684
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:16,240
Jay, Rasorn Russameekrikchai, a rising singer behind the hit song
‘Obsessed’, has been summoned for questioning

685
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,120
at the Special Investigation Unit.

686
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,840
Previously, Jay faced allegations of assaulting his ex-girlfriend,

687
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,720
which led to his temporary disappearance from the entertainment scene

688
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,640
before making a major comeback…

689
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,320
After parting ways with Yardpirun,

690
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,760
where were you?

691
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,000
Do you have an alibi?

692
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,640
Yes, we have security footage from Jay’s condo

693
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,600
confirming that he didn’t leave.

694
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,040
He only went downstairs to see Yardpirun off,

695
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,080
then stayed in his room the rest of the time.

696
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,960
Can I talk?

697
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,160
No, sir, Mr. Jay.

698
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,800
If anything happens,

699
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,600
we’ll handle this in court.

700
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,040
I can't stand listening to this anymore.

701
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,440
Officer.

702
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,640
I swear,

703
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,720
I didn’t do it!

704
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,440
I didn’t hurt her or my ex.

705
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,840
It's just...

706
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,880
the agency wouldn’t let me say anything

707
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,400
and told me to let the rumors die down.

708
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,920
That's it.

709
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,760
Since the time of Yardpirun’s death

710
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,440
coincides with when she was with you,

711
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,480
Can I ask you something?

712
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,280
While you were together,

713
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,080
did anything unusual happen?

714
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,320
Um,

715
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,640
Let me put it this way.

716
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,720
Me and Yard are friends.

717
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,360
That means

718
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,480
there's no point for me

719
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,840
to hurt her.

720
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,720
And the relationship...

721
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,000
I admit that

722
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,040
we were together.

723
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,600
But everything

724
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
is consensual, mutually.

725
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,720
I just gave her eveything that she wanted.

726
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,440
That's it.

727
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,440
I think you better use your precious time

728
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,280
to seek for more useful information,

729
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,200
instead of wasting your time like this.

730
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,800
Let's go.

731
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,680
Wait a minute.

732
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,320
What about the scratches on your neck?

733
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,680
What caused those scratch marks?

734
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,280
They’re cat scratches.

735
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,640
Jay has two cats at his condo.

736
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,080
Then, I’d like Mr. Jay

737
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,800
to have those scratches examined

738
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,560
to determine when they were made and

739
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,360
whether they match the time of the incident.

740
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,400
Yes. Sure.

741
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,200
Schedule it, then.

742
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,200
I think you’ve gotten enough out of him for now.

743
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,720
Any further questions

744
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,920
should be addressed in court.

745
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,640
So where did the wooden bit come from?

746
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,440
The person who did this,

747
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,840
he doesn't care about the parents' feeling.

748
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,240
Lab results are ready.

749
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,000
The DNA result of the sperm found is out.

750
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,520
It matches Jay’s exactly,

751
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,000
but...

752
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,040
there’s another DNA found under the victim’s fingernails

753
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
that isn’t Jay’s.

754
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,400
Answer our questions, please.

755
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,520
Please give us something.

756
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,160
What started as a missing person's case

757
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,440
has turned into a national scandal.

758
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,600
You've really put yourself on the line with not one, but two major cases.

759
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,200
Tul!

760
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,280
I've found a CCTV footage!

761
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,600
Take a look at this.

762
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,720
Hello.

763
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,120
Hello, I'm Dr. Cherran.

764
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,680
The forensic doctor who takes care of Yardpirun's case.

765
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,080
We met at the autopsy room the other day.

766
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,640
Do you remember?

767
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,840
Oh, that doctor, I remember.

768
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,240
How can I help you?

769
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,520
Um...

770
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,040
I just want to ask you a few more questions.

771
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,840
Would now be a good time?

772
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,840
Yes. Sure.

773
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,160
I really want to thank you for helping me find the real culprit.

774
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,960
Uh, should we talk inside?

775
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,680
Come in, please.

776
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,040
I'M AT YARDPIRUN"S HOUSE

777
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,760
Come quickly.

778
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,520
, faster!

779
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,520
Got it.

780
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,920
Here's your water.

781
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,480
How did you get that scratch on your wrist?

782
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,520
I was gardening and got snagged by a branch.

783
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,440
By the way, what do you want to ask, Doctor?

784
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,000
It's about Ms. Yardpirun's case.

785
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,440
I'd like to know if you have more information about Mr. Jay.

786
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,840
I mean

787
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,080
my daughter was in that line of work,

788
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,640
so she probably had lots of clients.

789
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,520
Can't believe someone that famous would do something like this.

790
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,760
I want

791
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,200
whoever did this to my daughter get punished.

792
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:15,120
The police haven’t confirmed Mr. Jay as the culprit yet.

793
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,240
What? They’re still unsure? How could it not be him?

794
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,240
I understand. But we still need to wait for an official announcement.

795
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,080
Are you trying to say that the culprit is someone else?

796
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,120
Since he was the last person she visited at his condo,

797
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,080
who else could it be?

798
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,360
How do you know

799
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,840
that Yardpirun went to Jay’s condo?

800
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,920
How long have you known?

801
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,720
Um...

802
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,520
I read the news about my daughter.

803
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,720
It’s everywhere.

804
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,400
Please excuse me.

805
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,800
If you have more questions, I'll come back and answer them.

806
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,680
The results are out.

807
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,600
The DNA under Yardpirun's nails matches her father.

808
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,040
But Yardpirun's DNA doesn't match her father's.

809
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,040
I think they aren't biologically related.

810
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,720
Doctor!

811
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,840
INSPECTOR OCTOBER

812
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,520
It's a shame, Doctor.

813
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,440
If you’d let that damn singer take the fall, it would’ve been over.

814
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,560
Just rest for a bit.

815
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,280
It won’t hurt as much that way.

816
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,240
You little bitch!

817
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,800
I'll kill you.

818
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,000
Hey! Hey!

819
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,840
Hey, Doctor.

820
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,000
Are you okay?

821
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,520
Are you alright? Is everything OK?

822
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,360
I'm okay.

823
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:34,000
The police have arrested the true culprit of the
gruesome murder of Yardpirun.

824
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,640
It's found that suspect is none other than her stepfather,

825
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,840
Or Mr. Karan Suktemee.

826
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,640
Initial investigations reveal that

827
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,240
Karan had repeatedly lied during questioning.

828
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,160
Evidence gathered from the house indicates that

829
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,320
he often quarreled with Yardpirun and

830
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,560
had assaulted her in the past.

831
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,240
Out of twisted affection for his stepdaughter,

832
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,440
he violated her

833
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,640
and, upon discovering her involvement in prostitution,

834
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,200
they had a fight,

835
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,400
before he killed her in a fit of jealousy.

836
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,840
I told you.

837
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm fine. It's nothing.

838
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,960
You're hurt, too.

839
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,640
It’s just a scratch.

840
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,960
You keep saying you’re fine,

841
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,760
but what if I hadn’t made it in time?

842
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,360
What if you’d been killed?

843
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,000
I was just worried

844
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,440
he'd escape.

845
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,040
And eventually there will be no evidence left.

846
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,120
One more thing,

847
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,320
weren't you busy interrogating Mr. Jay?

848
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,120
It's not like I could call you for help, couldn't I?

849
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:04,880
I understand you meant well,

850
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,400
but if something had happened to you,

851
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,800
how could I explain it to everyone?

852
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,280
That you died trying to help me?

853
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,600
Do you want me to live with that guilt?

854
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,040
That was very close, Doctor.

855
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,080
I've warned you.

856
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,480
Don’t overstep like that again.

857
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,240
Do you understand?

858
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,640
How's Run?

859
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,960
Uh...

860
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,920
I'm Dr. Ruk.

861
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,960
I'm her father.

862
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:24,920
Oh, Father.

863
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,440
Hello, Doctor.

864
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,240
Run's safe.

865
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,280
Rest for another night and she should be better.

866
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,600
You must be Inspector Tul,

867
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,400
who is in charge of this case, right?

868
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,200
Yes, sir.

869
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,320
My apologies for putting Dr. Run in danger.

870
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,440
It's okay.

871
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,240
I know my daughter well.

872
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,920
Well, the two of you probably have to work together for a long time.

873
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,360
Run, she's quite stubborn.

874
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,240
She may seem aloof,

875
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,360
but actually she's very kind-hearted.

876
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,800
Well, please take a good care of Run, Inspector.

877
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,520
Sure.

878
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,440
DNA evidence found in the victim's fingernail matches with Mr. Karan's

879
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,240
And the small wooden bit found under her fingernails also matches with

880
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,520
the wooden floor in his house.

881
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,400
Additionally, the weapon used in the crime was also found here.

882
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,320
Oh.

883
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,520
Are you awake?

884
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,040
Actually,

885
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,840
you didn’t have to stay here.

886
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,680
The nurse's already finished treating my wound.

887
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,200
It's okay.

888
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,040
I already told  and Phu to take over.

889
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,080
You'll be discharged tomorrow.

890
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,920
Tomorrow, we’ll give statements together.

891
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,040
Besides,

892
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,680
we have to wait for your physical exam result.

893
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,240
We’ll use them to file additional charges against Yardpirun's father.

894
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,240
I'm fine, really.

895
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,080
Or you can just come here tomorrow.

896
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,040
I mean I can manage myself alone.

897
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,520
It's okay.

898
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,080
I think I'm going to sleep just right here.

899
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,160
How's your wound?

900
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,440
I’ve already taken care of it.

901
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,800
If you’ve already taken care of it, why didn’t you do it properly?

902
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,840
You should learn to take care of youself better.

903
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,600
Instead of taking time to care for others.

904
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,240
It's just a scratch. It's nothing.

905
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,400
The tape’s coming off.

906
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,400
Come here.

907
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,640
Let me take a look.

908
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,720
Come here!

909
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,680
I think

910
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,280
I won't resign from the forensics department.

911
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:34,880
That's good.

912
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,520
Why were you going to resign in the first place?

913
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,240
I was fed up with the cops who just go through the motions.

914
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,200
No one cares about the victims.

915
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,000
They just do the jobs in hope of promotion.

916
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,280
Then why did you change your mind?

917
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,280
After seeing both Wasan and Yardpirun's case,

918
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,040
I think I’ve found a cop who I can genuinely rely on.

919
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,120
So keep working here for a while won't hurt anyone, right

920
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,400
Anyway.

921
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,600
Thank you very much, Doctor.

922
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,440
It's goot that you didn't quit.

923
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,240
You’ll have to deal with me for a long time.

924
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,920
Do you think it's possible that Wisut is not guilty of Ploypapas' case.

925
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,000
Why would you think that?

926
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,720
Now, cops like you are targeting at only one person.

927
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,640
Maybe it's someone else.

928
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,240
Someone that's close to the victim.

929
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,280
Maybe it's not Wisut.

930
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,040
Maybe there's someone looking for a loophole from this.

931
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,000
Just like Yardpirun's father.

932
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,240
From your point of view,

933
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,400
what kind of a person the Raindrop Killer must be?

934
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,000
I think that person might have some internal conflict.

935
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,040
Maybe mental disorder

936
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,040
or personal disorder of some sort.

937
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,280
This thing.

938
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,400
It'll help us nail the person who killed ploypapas.

939
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,320
I think I'm not thinking of you as colleague.

940
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,160
I like you.
