Move, and I'll shoot.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,680
You really think you can run?

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,200
Huh?

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,400
Mr. Arthit, your wife just reported you for assault.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,840
For just a charge like that,

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,800
you really need to do this much?

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,760
An assault case

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,640
is one thing,

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,880
but right now, you are a suspect in another case, Mr. Arthit.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,480
Kneel.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,520
I said, kneel!

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,720
Oy, what are you doing?

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Stay still.

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,680
Hey!

18
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,840
From the testimony of Ms. Jantima,

19
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,480
do you admit to using violence on your own wife?

20
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,720
This includes the past assault case with Ms.Nongkran,

21
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,920
your sister, as well.

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,240
What, you an orphan or something?

23
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
Don’t you have a family?

24
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,280
Why don’t you get that among family,

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
we fight and things may go out of control sometimes.

26
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,960
No, I don’t get that.

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,280
This kind of thing can’t just be handwaved away.

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,280
No matter what the case, violence shouldn’t be used.

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
Never.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,160
Whatever.

31
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
About my sister,

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,440
she’s long dead.

33
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,640
Shouldn’t be any complaint from her, hm?

34
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,640
Then what about Chutikarn.

35
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,880
Hey, how is Chutikarn related to this?

36
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,640
I made a proposal before you,

37
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
how dare you cut in line?

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,360
Just because you are MP, you think you can do
|whatever you want?!

39
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,519
Just you wait, I am gonna expose you!

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,880
Are you sure about that?

41
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,880
Don’t forget who’s protecting you.

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,760
If you don't back off, I'm not gonna let this go.

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,720
Someone like you, what can you do?

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Chutikarn!

45
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,480
Fuck!

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
On the day MP Chutikarn died,

47
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,880
you were the last person to contact her.

48
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
You also clearly acted threatening.

49
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,680
That MP bitch

50
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,400
took over my deal with a bribe.

51
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
The deal,

52
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,560
the connections.

53
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
I put in a lot to get them,

54
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,240
and she took them all away.

55
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
Was it so bad as to commit murder?

56
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,240
What murder?

57
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
I didn’t do shit.

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
How MP Chutikarn died,

59
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,960
and how your sister died 18 years ago.

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,920
It's exactly the same.

61
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,960
Don’t you think it’s too much to be a coincidence?

62
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,320
You think I killed the MP, and my own sister?!

63
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,880
Look.

64
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,440
I'm not such scum as to kill just for that.

65
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,400
So when this happened to MP Chutikarn,

66
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Where are you?

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,200
Home.

68
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
After the talk,

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,640
I went for a drive to cool my head.

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,040
I then went home.

71
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,680
If you don’t believe me then just ask my wife.

72
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
Next thing I knew,

73
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,320
the MP’s already dead.

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,680
A snake like her probably had a lot of enemies.

75
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,520
Let me ask you something, Mr. Arthit.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,440
Did you and MP Chutikarn

77
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,480
share anything beyond a working relationship?

78
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Look,

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880
I might be like this,

80
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
but I don’t just do anyone.

81
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
What do you think I am?

82
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,800
The MP and I are just people who used to work together.

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,920
Nothing more.

84
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,480
Also,

85
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,000
just the thought of touching her…

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,520
That’s disgusting.

87
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,640
Get this off!

88
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,120
But when you went for a drive,

89
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,080
you didn’t have any witnesses.

90
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,159
I think you are not going anywhere soon.

91
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,760
Why do you keep pestering me?!

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
So annoying.

93
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Hello, Jiu.

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
Are you with Ms. Jantima?

95
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,080
No, not anymore.

96
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,240
Then I ask that you and Phu go find out.

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,640
if Mr. Arthit went home

98
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,200
on the day of MP Chutikarn’s murder.

99
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Find if there’s any witnesses.

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
Because he attested that

101
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,480
he went home to his wife that day.

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,280
Roger. I and Phu will see to it right away.

103
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,720
Thank you.

104
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
Inspector, ma’am.

105
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,320
What is it, Sarge.

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Big Tech’s called for you.

107
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,080
Hardworking, aren’t you?

108
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,680
I simply did what us police should do.

109
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
I am wondering if this is a case you should be responsible for.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
It’s an assault case.

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,640
Not related to the one under your personal supervision.

112
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,679
I hope that there won't be any problem.

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
If it’s with you then of course there is.

114
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,160
But the person you took in

115
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
happen to be connected to the dead MP.

116
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
It’s not a coincidence, sir.

117
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,240
But it depends on how we gather evidence for use in the judicial process.

118
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,120
Is it not the duty of us police

119
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
to do exactly that?

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,360
Then I must thank you for catching the perp for me.

121
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
More options on how to close this case.

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,800
I can't believe this.

123
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,640
It’s been 20 years,

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,440
but you are still the same.

125
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
The very same.

126
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
And you should do as your father does.

127
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Walk in my footsteps,

128
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,480
and you can only go up and up.

129
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,360
There’s still a chance for you.

130
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
If you do as I say…

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
You are talented.

132
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,200
No one’s gonna bat an eye if I promote you.

133
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
Thank you for your goodwill, sir.

134
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
But it’s unwanted.

135
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,400
I will stand by what is right.

136
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Look at how involved I am in this case.

137
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,040
You should know.

138
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
what you should do.

139
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,360
And what you shouldn’t do.

140
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,520
Or what?

141
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,680
You think because you are my child, you can do whatever you want?

142
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
And back then you said that I am not your child.

143
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,320
To say that

144
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
I am one right now,

145
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,320
aren’t you breaking your word?

146
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,640
That’s no surprise to me though.

147
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,240
Tul! Shut the back talk.

148
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,480
There's more to this case than you think.

149
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,600
This truth that you want to know so much, it’s gonna make you cry,

150
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,360
like when you learned that your mom left you!

151
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,960
This has nothing to do with my mother!

152
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,400
Don’t bring personal matters into this!

153
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you sure

154
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,800
that your personal matters aren’t related to work?!

155
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,120
I will give you one last chance.

156
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,560
Stop involving yourself in this case.

157
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,480
Or be ready to get fired.

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,880
Yes.

159
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,040
Thank you for your warning,

160
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,640
Sir.

161
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,680
Here, hold this for me.

162
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,480
Where are you?

163
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,800
Near Tin’s home.

164
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,440
What’s the matter?

165
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,400
I got a bit scared after taking in what you said,

166
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,440
so I dug around a bit more.

167
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,240
I’ll send pics in a moment.

168
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
You got them?

169
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,640
So, I saw some news from overseas.

170
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,480
A woman came out to expose him,

171
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,120
but Kawin’s family bought her silence.

172
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,880
This was after she got assaulted,

173
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,880
because he couldn’t contain his anger.

174
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,680
It was so bad that they needed to buy her silence?

175
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,440
How bad was it?

176
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
Quite.

177
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,880
The woman needed surgeries in several spots.

178
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,520
You said that you are with Tin?

179
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
Nah.

180
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,000
I am just here to see if Kawin’s got anything suspicious.

181
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,000
At most I just take some evidence back for analysis.

182
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,400
You want to collect DNA samples to see if it matches

183
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,280
the hair on the MP’s body, right?

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,080
You are going above and beyond your duties again.

185
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Wouldn’t it be better if you tell Inspector Tul about this?

186
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,960
You don’t need to worry.

187
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,360
I can take care of myself.

188
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,240
You just prioritize the DNA test results for me.

189
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,200
I am hanging up.

190
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,440
Hello, Jiu.

191
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,360
You with Inspector Tul?

192
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,200
I am a bit worried about Run.

193
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,720
Tul.

194
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,560
What’s the matter, Jiu?

195
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,720
What’s the rush?

196
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,560
May said that Dr. Run’s looking into a guy named Kawin.

197
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,880
Seems like he was the last person to see MP Chutikarn alive.

198
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
Wait.

199
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Kawin, that famous rich guy?

200
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,680
Yeah. You know him?

201
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I do.

202
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,560
He’s Tin’s friend.

203
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
How is he connected to MP Chutikarn?

204
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,760
May said that Kawin is MP Chutikarn’s sex partner.

205
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,160
Dr. Run found a picture of a party with Kawin in it.

206
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,360
Right now, Dr. Run’s following Kawin to your home.

207
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,960
Oy, wait.

208
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
She’s following?

209
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,680
Here, Tul.

210
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,480
I got the CCTV footage in front of Mr. Arthit’s home.

211
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,600
From the footage, on the day of the incident,

212
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,280
Arthit really did go home.

213
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Then I compared MP Chutikarn’s time of death

214
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,440
to the time Arthit was driving home.

215
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,640
It’s the same time period.

216
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,160
Doesn’t this mean that Arthit’s probably not the perp?

217
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,440
We can’t cut out anyone just yet.

218
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,320
In the time period from 11 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.

219
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,200
Arthit still doesn’t have any witnesses.

220
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,920
We still have to keep him in.

221
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,640
But we know for sure,

222
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,760
that Kawin’s another one that we need to look into.

223
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,760
Let’s do that later.

224
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,360
Right now you should go after Dr. Run.

225
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,000
Leave finding out about Kawin and MP Chutikarn to me and Jiu.

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
Alright, I’ll leave that to you two.

227
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,560
Roger that.

228
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,280
What’s up, Run?

229
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,720
Uh, I want to buy some desserts for my father.

230
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,240
May I ask if you are at the shop? I’ll go in.

231
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,359
Desserts…there’s some.

232
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,880
But I am closing up soon, and I am going out after too.

233
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,360
But I am really close. I just happen to be nearby.

234
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,440
Where are you now?

235
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,880
Should I send them by delivery?

236
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,800
I am in a real hurry today.

237
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,960
I am afraid that you won’t see me if you come.

238
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
But I really am close to the shop now, Tin.

239
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,480
I’ll go and play with Hed too.

240
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,080
Uh, uh,

241
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,560
Err…maybe another day, Run.

242
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,360
I'm really in a hurry today.

243
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,920
My friend’s waiting for me too.

244
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Alright.

245
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
Then, I’ll call you about the desserts later.

246
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Take it there.

247
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,840
Here.

248
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,080
Take a pic now.

249
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,320
Let’s go

250
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,560
Go, quick.

251
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,720
Okay.

252
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,960
I am gonna run a decryption program on Kawin’s dating app.

253
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Let’s try it and see what we find.

254
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,000
It’s hard to believe,

255
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,480
that someone handsome like Kawin

256
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,600
is connected to a murder case.

257
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,480
Man, Jiu, you know as well

258
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,680
that we can’t judge someone by their face.

259
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
There’s a chance that if I can break into his account,

260
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,480
I can look into what happened 18 years ago.

261
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,320
18 year’s a bit much.

262
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,280
Wasn’t he too young to kill?

263
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,720
I mean, if he’s friends with Tin,

264
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
then they should be around the same age.

265
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
That’s not young anymore.

266
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
Look at this.

267
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,120
Holy.

268
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,680
That’s a ton of depraved sex vids.

269
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,200
This is the oldest clip from 10 years ago.

270
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,280
If we go back to 18 years ago,

271
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,800
you think that he didn’t have this kind of preference then?

272
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,400
We don’t have any info to connect him to that case yet,

273
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,040
and the police didn’t call him in for questioning.

274
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,480
Exactly.

275
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,680
I’ll be back.

276
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,800
You check if there’s anything new in Kawin’s secret account.

277
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Where are you going then?

278
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,080
Aren’t we trying to find how Kawin is connected to the Raindrop Killer case?

279
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,280
If he really is connected to it,

280
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,120
then Arthit must know something.

281
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,360
Hello, Mr. Arthit

282
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,560
I want to ask you

283
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,920
about the case from 18 years ago. Your sister’s.

284
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,160
Really,

285
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,280
this again?!

286
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,960
I told you

287
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,080
that she and I had nothing to do with each other.

288
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,600
Why make such a fuss?

289
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,280
I wanted to ask you

290
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,000
about your sister’s customers.

291
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,560
But if you won’t cooperate,

292
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,880
then an assault case probably isn’t the only one you got.

293
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
You seem to have something

294
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,280
to do with MP Chutikarn’s case.

295
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,840
The CCTV footage is clear:

296
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,080
you had a problem with the MP.

297
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,720
Ask your questions.

298
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,440
Are you acquainted with a man named Kawin?

299
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,280
I've seen him.

300
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,280
But that was long ago.

301
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,960
Still, I can remember.

302
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,680
Anyone home?!

303
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,480
Who are you here for?

304
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,320
Is Nongkran here?

305
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,880
No.

306
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,440
She moved out long ago.

307
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,000
Anything else?

308
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,280
She stole from me.

309
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,680
Look, you aren’t the first to come to me for that.

310
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,200
My sister, she loves stealing from customers

311
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,000
But I don’t know where she lives anymore.

312
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,680
We haven’t been in contact for ages.

313
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,920
If you’ll excuse me.

314
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,280
Hey! Ha?!

315
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,080
You go and tell your sister! That if she won’t return my things,

316
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,840
I am putting her in jail!

317
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,720
Look! If you wanna be angry, go be angry at her!

318
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,680
Don’t get me involved!

319
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,480
Hey! You, listen!

320
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,760
Hey! Hey!

321
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,280
That fucker, he was real irritated.

322
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,040
I told him that I had nothing to do with my sister.

323
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,880
I have no idea why he threw a fit at me.

324
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,680
So it seems that your sister and Kawin really were in contact, right?

325
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,280
Probably.

326
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,280
He’s probably her customer.

327
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,080
What's up, Jiu?

328
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,160
Tul, Kawin and the sixth victim of the Raindrop case were connected.

329
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,240
The two were sex partners.

330
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,440
And the time period when Kawin returned to Thailand, coincides with the Kuljira case happening.

331
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,680
OK. Jiu.

332
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,160
Why don't you answer?

333
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,440
Tin!

334
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,560
Doctor.

335
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,240
You are Tul’s girlfriend?

336
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,360
Yes.

337
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,040
Oh.

338
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,120
It’s to fix the bathroom for Tin.

339
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,960
The pipe outside bursted.

340
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,880
I haven’t finished smashing yet.

341
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,440
You got any business here?

342
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,080
No, not really.

343
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,760
So,

344
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,160
where’s Tin?

345
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,120
On the balcony.

346
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,280
It’s raining, so he’s probably taking laundry in.

347
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,280
So...

348
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,080
If that’s the case, then, I am going to him now.

349
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,560
I think you shouldn’t.

350
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,160
Tin!

351
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,680
Run!

352
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,560
Tin!

353
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,840
Run!

354
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,960
What are you searching for?

355
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,360
My phone.

356
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,760
I can't find it.

357
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,680
I probably have DND turned on.

358
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,160
Can I use your phone?

359
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,720
Yeah.

360
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,680
Found it.

361
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,880
Pick up the phone, Jiu!

362
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,280
Jiu!

363
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,680
Send reinforcements to the location I sent you right away!

364
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,680
Hurry!

365
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,800
Captain.

366
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,040
Sir.

367
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
What’s happening?

368
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,120
Inspector Tul has reported that your son…

369
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,520
What about Tin?

370
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,760
Your son and Dr. Run were taken from the house by his friend Kawin.

371
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,520
Let’s go.

372
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,320
Excuse me, sir.

373
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,880
Tin.

374
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,040
Run, you are up?

375
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,680
In the case from 18 years ago,

376
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,200
ropes were tied three times before being tied into a knot.

377
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,200
Tul!

378
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,280
Tin, you are the Raindrop Killer?

379
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,240
Isn’t it obvious?

380
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Do I need to hit him more?

381
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,080
Actually,

382
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,880
Run,

383
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,280
you shouldn't have been nosy.

384
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,880
You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t.

385
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,000
I even tried and tell you

386
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,320
that I'm busy today.

387
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,480
But you just had to come in.

388
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,639
Tin, how could you do this to me? To Tul?!

389
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
I know that you tried to sniff me out.

390
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,280
But you won’t reach me.

391
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,440
All you do is follow the crumbs I left behind for the dumbass police

392
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,159
so that they can go and catch the wrong guy.

393
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,960
How very stupid.

394
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,880
Also those fuckers

395
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,400
that tried to copy my work.

396
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,840
Disgusting.

397
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,320
Why are you doing this?

398
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,120
Because of those whores!

399
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,360
Oh.

400
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,280
Those fucking sluts, good riddance.

401
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,640
What right do you have

402
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,160
to judge their lives!

403
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
What right do they have to do this to my fucking life!? Huh!

404
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,920
So many jobs to choose but she just had to sell herself!

405
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,320
And then she left!

406
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Just like that!

407
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,720
But, you know,

408
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,880
when

409
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,640
I smashed

410
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,280
this hammer down,

411
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,120
and they begged for their lives,

412
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,680
I was so,

413
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,360
so happy.

414
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,640
I got to make this land a little better.

415
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,040
Bit, by bit!

416
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,200
Bit, by bit!

417
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,560
Then why did you kill my mother!?

418
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
My mom, she was just a housewife.

419
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,480
Why kill her?

420
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,280
Actually, your mother did nothing wrong.

421
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,440
It’s just that she was at the wrong place, at the wrong time.

422
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,320
That’s all.

423
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,320
What the fuck is wrong with you!?

424
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,400
You took me and Kawin here.

425
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,520
You really think that no one will follow us here?

426
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,080
I thought that you were smart.

427
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,360
Turns out,

428
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,880
you are fucking stupid!

429
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,040
Your mouth’s still working, hm?

430
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,880
How about a smash?

431
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,400
Let's see if it’s working then.

432
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,120
How about it?!

433
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,320
Yeah. Should be good.

434
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,080
Freeze!

435
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,480
Put down the weapon!

436
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,880
Put it down!

437
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,040
The fuck is this?

438
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,960
Are you for real?

439
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,880
Finally.

440
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,440
The day has arrived.

441
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,400
I told you, you can do this.

442
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,800
That’s my sister.

443
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
It’s gotta be you, I told you.

444
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,080
I’m so proud of you!

445
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,920
Stop!

446
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,640
I said stop!

447
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Put the weapon down.

448
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,720
Or I shoot.

449
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,320
Shoot then.

450
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,760
Shoot!

451
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,160
Shoot me.

452
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,880
Shoot me now!

453
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Did mom call, Tin?

454
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,680
Uh-huh.

455
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,880
Mom called me.

456
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,880
She said that

457
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,160
she has to work in England for a while.

458
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,240
Does she need to go that far?

459
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,880
She didn’t think to tell us?

460
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,880
She must have her reasons.

461
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,720
She needs to make money, remember?

462
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,960
Will she stay there for a long time?

463
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,880
It's okay, Tul

464
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,920
We can stay together like this.

465
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,880
I’ll take care of you.

466
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,520
Shoot me.

467
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,760
Okay.

468
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,360
Stop!

469
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,680
I said stop!

470
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,360
Shouldn’t police shoot here, Tul?

471
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,680
Why didn’t you?

472
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,680
Shoot me.

473
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,560
Right here.

474
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,480
Why didn’t you shoot, Tul?

475
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,480
Shoot me now.

476
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,240
I said stop!

477
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,680
Shoot me!

478
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,680
I’ve killed, you know?

479
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,320
Tul!

480
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,440
Tul! Tul!

481
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,120
Are you hurt?

482
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,360
Tul!

483
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,800
The suspect is going through the back.

484
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,680
Hurry after him!

485
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,280
Are you okay?

486
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,480
Dispatch, requesting immediate reinforcement.

487
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,760
Run!

488
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,880
Are you alright?!

489
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,680
Tul!

490
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,920
Tul!

491
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,040
What the hell happened?

492
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,760
I am here.

493
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,280
Tin.

494
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,480
Why’s mom not here to tuck me in tonight?

495
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,080
She’s probably working like usual.

496
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,560
Go to bed already,

497
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
so you can wake up to mom’s breakfast tomorrow.

498
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,680
Go to sleep.

499
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,200
You need to be up early tomorrow.

500
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,520
Fine.

501
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,920
Tin

502
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,360
will you hold me?

503
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,560
You go first.

504
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,080
I will be with you right here.

505
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,560
Okay?

506
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,360
Run. Did you see his face?

507
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,480
It’s okay to tell me.

508
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,240
May I have a word?

509
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,480
What happened?

510
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,360
Why is Run not saying anything?

511
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,760
She hasn't told you anything?

512
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,720
In fact,

513
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,960
I didn’t see his face either.

514
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,920
It was raining heavily,

515
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,600
and it was really dark.

516
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,600
I am so sorry.

517
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,960
This is on me.

518
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,160
It's okay. It's okay.

519
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,640
Don’t blame yourself.

520
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,720
In any case, may I talk to Run?

521
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,040
Of course.

522
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,560
Tell me if anything comes up.

523
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,360
May I speak with her in private?

524
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,680
Tul.

525
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,200
You saw the same as me, right?

526
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,680
I'm sorry, Run.

527
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,120
For failing to protect you.

528
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,920
For overlooking things so it’s become like this.

529
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,840
I don’t know

530
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,280
why Tin is like this.

531
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,640
He’s not like the man I once knew.

532
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,080
I know that what you are facing is really heavy.

533
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,960
No one can shoulder it, and no one can understand.

534
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,600
I am feeling it too.

535
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,760
But it’s not your fault in the least.

536
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,960
I know.

537
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,960
But I became a cop,

538
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,320
because I want things to be better.

539
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,520
But...

540
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,920
both my father and brother

541
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,280
are somehow doing evil.

542
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,080
I’ve always wanted to learn the truth about my mom.

543
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,720
I thought that,

544
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,920
if I find the person that killed her one day,

545
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,680
I’ll be the one to bring her justice.

546
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,600
But when the killer turns out to be someone I know.

547
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,280
Someone I considered family.

548
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
It’s hard for me to take it as it is too.

549
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,120
What will you do next?

550
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,960
I have no idea where to start.

551
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,120
I don’t even know how to break this news.

552
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,120
But Tin wasn’t at the scene.

553
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,960
They will find out who the killer is.

554
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,480
I don’t know, Run.

555
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,760
You do, Tul.

556
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,920
Tin is the killer.

557
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,240
You, are you going to cover this up?

558
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,120
Do you remember when I told you that my mom was the last victim?

559
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,200
You told me that you would help me find the real killer.

560
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,960
I do.

561
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,680
No way I can forget that.

562
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,040
I must put Tin in jail at all costs.

563
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,640
Run, can I ask one thing of you?

564
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,040
Can you keep this to yourself for now?

565
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,440
I, can I have some time to think about this first?

566
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,880
I think,

567
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,760
you should go back for now.

568
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,360
We shouldn’t talk here any further.

569
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,760
Run

570
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,280
You have to tell the truth.

571
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,920
Because that's the right thing to do.

572
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,240
like you’ve always believed in and done.

573
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,680
Unless

574
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,080
I’ve been wrong about you this whole time.

575
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,640
I told you, didn't I?

576
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,520
The truth will make you cry.

577
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,920
I know,

578
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,800
that you two love each other a lot.

579
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,160
If Tin really got caught,

580
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,080
the death penalty’s very likely.

581
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,480
I’ve prepared the best way out for everyone.

582
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,600
Honestly,

583
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,080
right now you are no different from Big Tech.

584
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,560
If it’s so easy,

585
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,400
I would’ve done it already!
