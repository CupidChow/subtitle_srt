I told you.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,840
The truth will make you cry.

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,560
So now you know

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,040
who the Raindrop Killer is.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,400
Go then.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
Go catch him.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,000
Put him in jail for me to see!

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,200
You are a straight-laced cop,

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,680
unlike me, aren’t you?!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Enough.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,880
What do you want from me?

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,520
I know

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
that you two love each other a lot.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,800
But if Tin really got caught,

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,039
the death penalty’s very likely.

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,160
But Tin’s a murderer.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,000
He has it coming.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,440
Look, Tul,

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,240
Tin’s the only one you’ve left.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,920
And he cherishes you as much as his own life.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,320
Do you really want to lose your brother?

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,960
I’ve prepared the best way out for everyone.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,600
You just have to keep quiet about Tin,

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,840
and everything will be fine.

27
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,400
Tul! Be careful of falls.

28
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Yes, Mom.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don’t you want these?

30
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,760
Look!

31
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,480
Shoes!

32
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,360
It’s cute!

33
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,040
Tin.

34
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
Why’s mom not here to tuck me in?

35
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,640
She’s probably working like usual.

36
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
Go to bed already,

37
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,400
so you can wake up to mom’s breakfast.

38
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,440
Go to sleep.

39
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
You need to be up early.

40
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
Fine.

41
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,760
Tin.

42
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Can you hold me?

43
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,400
You go first.

44
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
I will be with you right here.

45
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Okay?

46
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,680
[ TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTER. I’LL BE BACK. ]

47
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
Where has mom gone, Tin?

48
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
She’s probably at work.

49
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,400
But...

50
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,600
it’s been a few days.

51
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,280
Don't cry.

52
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,400
She'll be back soon.

53
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,600
And how many days is soon?

54
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,440
So, mom’s abandoned us like dad did, right?

55
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
No, Tul.

56
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,200
Then when will mom be back?

57
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,400
Sorry. This number cannot be reached at this time.

58
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,720
Sorry. This number cannot be reached at this time.

59
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,320
Sorry. This number cannot be reached at this time.

60
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,240
Goddammit!

61
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,040
No! Shut up!

62
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,160
Shut up! Ugh!

63
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,800
Ugh! No! No!

64
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,920
Hold on. Wait,  wait.

65
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,880
Handsome.

66
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Why the rush? Hm?

67
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,920
Why don’t we have some fun?

68
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,640
Oh!

69
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,960
Oohhh!

70
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
What the fuck is wrong with you?

71
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,680
There’s no need to be rough!

72
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
I am sorry!

73
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,520
Please don’t hurt me! Let me live!

74
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,400
Hello, dear.

75
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
A night’s 2,000 baht. Room included.

76
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,480
This is your first time buying?

77
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,280
Yes.

78
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,480
Then I’ll make your first time unforgettable.

79
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Help!

80
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,440
Help me!

81
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,040
Help!

82
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,640
Please don’t hurt me! Please let me go!

83
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
I have kids to take care of.

84
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,400
Oh.

85
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,320
Having a kid’s no excuse to be a hooker.

86
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,200
What’s bad about that?!

87
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,120
I am just trying to live. I didn’t cheat anyone.

88
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,080
There’re so many other jobs!

89
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
I don’t have a choice!

90
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,040
No choice, huh?

91
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,400
You don’t have a choice?

92
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,240
That’s why you left my sister to me, huh?!

93
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,800
You said that you’ll be back!

94
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
Help!

95
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,440
Help me!

96
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,800
Help!

97
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,400
Help me!

98
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,440
Please let me go!

99
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,320
Please let me go!

100
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,760
Please don't hurt me.

101
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,640
Quiet.

102
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
Quiet.

103
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,600
People like you are selfish.

104
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
Disgusting.

105
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,200
Shouldn’t be a mother!

106
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Coming here,

107
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,400
are you old enough?

108
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,720
Your face is still young.

109
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,920
What of it?

110
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,640
I mean, we all know why you'd come here.

111
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
To get some bitches.

112
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,520
At a time like this,

113
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,800
who goes out?

114
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,000
You shy?

115
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,800
Is this your first?

116
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,800
That building, all of em great girls,

117
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,440
when they get off work,

118
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,080
they all go home in my car.

119
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,880
That so?

120
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,200
Here.

121
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,800
Thank you.

122
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,200
Get me there~

123
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,360
Come on up.

124
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,320
Don't hurt me.

125
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Bingo.

126
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,840
Breaking news, The fifth victim of this horrifying murders
has been found.

127
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,600
The police are interviewing witnesses at speed

128
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
in order to find the killer before they act again.

129
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,480
Due to the tragic murder of Kawin the elite,

130
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,960
the police, led by Big Tech, are now trying to catch the killer with haste.

131
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,200
The important thing is that the killing pattern
is similar to the Raindrop Killer’s.

132
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,360
But this is the first time that the victim was male.

133
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
Tul, You should go.

134
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,320
We shouldn’t talk here any further.

135
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,240
Run.

136
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,560
You have to tell the truth.

137
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
Because that's the right thing to do.

138
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,320
like you’ve always believed in and done.

139
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,160
Unless,

140
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
I’ve been wrong about you this whole time.

141
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,240
Tul!

142
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,160
Tul!

143
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
Tul’s in her room, yeah?

144
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,880
Tul.

145
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
So, have you decided?

146
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,360
About what?

147
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,400
You can’t keep running from the truth.

148
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,600
You have to face it eventually.

149
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,600
What do you want from me, Run?

150
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,600
Do I need to repeat myself?

151
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,400
Won't you give me some time?

152
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,400
Give you time?

153
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
More like giving Tin time to kill more.

154
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,960
I thought that you’d be different from the other cops.

155
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,960
But you,

156
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,640
when it’s your own family,

157
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,640
you just let them go.

158
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,320
But Tin’s the last one left in my family.

159
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,160
I’m back. I’m back!

160
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,400
Sorry. Just got off work at the cafe.

161
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,800
The owner gave me lots of desserts today.

162
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
Here. This too.

163
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,280
Can I have this?

164
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,480
Of course! All these are yours, Tul.

165
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,440
Yay!

166
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,200
What’s for dinner today?

167
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,480
Dinner?  There’s stir-fried pork with chili,

168
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,600
and stir-fried glass noodles.

169
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,680
Tin!

170
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,000
Tin!

171
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Pretty?

172
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Ho ho!

173
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
You’ve become like this since when?

174
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,400
Pretty, yeah?

175
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,560
The prettiest, yep.

176
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,000
But...

177
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,360
you aren’t regretting, right?

178
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,920
That you are studying law instead of medicine.

179
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,040
Nah.

180
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,600
I mean, tutoring for medicine’s too expensive.

181
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,320
I don’t wanna be more of a burden.

182
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,760
Don't worry.

183
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
Also,

184
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,280
this is also one of my dreams.

185
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,920
You are the cutest, sis.

186
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,800
I know that Tin’s always been good to you.

187
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,440
But that can’t absolve him!

188
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,080
I know.

189
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,400
Why would I not?

190
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,080
You do?

191
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,120
That’s why you are sitting still like this?

192
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,040
Not doing a thing.

193
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,680
Honestly,

194
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,120
right now you are no different from Big Tech.

195
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,080
If it’s so easy,

196
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,560
I would’ve done it already!

197
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,480
I could’ve shot him dead at the scene!

198
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,840
Why didn’t you?

199
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,440
Because I couldn’t!

200
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,560
Don’t you get that I couldn’t?

201
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,960
If it’d been reversed,

202
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,080
and I’d been standing there instead of Tin,

203
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,600
could you’ve shot me?

204
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Why must you frame it like everything's easy?

205
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,280
Huh?

206
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,320
You know that I am a cop.

207
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,200
I’ve caught lots of killers.

208
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,840
But I fucking lived with one.

209
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,640
Ate with him.

210
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,080
Laughed with him.

211
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,800
Watched the news on the Raindrop killer with him.

212
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,600
Run, you have no idea

213
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,680
how stupid I’m feeling right now.

214
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,320
I nearly died that night too.

215
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,000
I saw how Tin killed Kawin.

216
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,400
It was the same way he used to kill my mom.

217
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,440
You don’t know

218
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,040
how much I’ve done

219
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,560
to find my mom’s killer.

220
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,360
Run.

221
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,560
What happened?

222
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,360
Why are you so pale and shaking?

223
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,199
I went to the scene.

224
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,600
The other cases, I can stomach.

225
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,400
But if it’s a female murder case with her face smashed, I…

226
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,880
You don’t have to force yourself to be a forensic physician.

227
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,400
Don’t you like the children’s ward more?

228
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,880
I must become a forensic physician.

229
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,720
Are you sure?

230
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
It’s fine.

231
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,240
Once I have more experience,

232
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,800
I'll get used to it.

233
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,800
I’ve been doing autopsies since the first case!

234
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,560
You shouldn’t pull me out.

235
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,960
But...

236
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,200
Hold on! Sir!

237
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,880
Daddy.

238
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,080
Yes, baby?

239
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Where’s mommy?

240
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,680
Mommy is on the way.

241
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,200
I'll call her for you.

242
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,840
Where are you now?

243
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,240
Run is sulking.

244
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,640
Talk to her for a bit.

245
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Baby,

246
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,840
Yes,

247
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,520
the party just finished.

248
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
I’m going home now.

249
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,080
Come now my girl, don’t be mad.

250
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,120
We’ll meet in just a bit!

251
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,000
Wait a moment.

252
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,920
Please swing by a bakery that’s still open this late.

253
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,400
Any shop will do.

254
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,560
Okay, mom.

255
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,680
I'm waiting for you.

256
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,880
Alright. I’ll go as fast as I can.

257
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,240
See you soon!

258
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,040
This one, please.

259
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Let me see!

260
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
You can't, sir.

261
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Is it Watcharin!?

262
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Is it her!?

263
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Is it Watcharin!?

264
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,360
I knew how the killer committed such acts,

265
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,680
but I didn’t expect him to be this inhumanely cruel.

266
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,480
Until I saw it with my own eyes.

267
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,200
Enough! Stop it already!

268
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,240
Just stop. Please.

269
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
You are my best friend,

270
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,080
Kawin.

271
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
But you shouldn’t’ve been nosy!

272
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Just stop it.

273
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,720
Hey, Tin.

274
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,360
Tin, stop it.

275
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,880
I beg you.

276
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,000
Please,

277
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,400
let's go home.

278
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,480
You, are the person I love the most, you know?

279
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,560
But I won't stop

280
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,600
I won't stop

281
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,800
He’s not normal.

282
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,480
He's a monster.

283
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,800
He’s still killing like he did 18 years ago,

284
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,920
but his pattern has changed.

285
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,480
He’ll kill anyone.

286
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,280
He killed Kawin.

287
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,680
Almost killed Jiu.

288
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,960
Almost killed me too!

289
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,800
The way he looked at me was so horrifying, you know?

290
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,600
It’s not how a brother looks at his sister’s girlfriend.

291
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,200
So,

292
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
you aren’t gonna do anything, right?

293
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,280
Fine.

294
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,640
If you won’t,

295
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,600
then I’ll go find Tin myself.

296
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,280
Run!

297
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,120
Run!

298
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,800
Long time no see.

299
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,600
You’re still as incompetent as ever,

300
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,360
letting me find you again.

301
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,720
What’s for today then?

302
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,720
You gonna put me in jail?

303
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,600
Father.

304
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Hey! Stop.

305
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,120
I didn't come to put you in jail.

306
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,000
Because a person like you

307
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,840
is just beyond repair.

308
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,000
I’ve prepared an out for you.

309
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,200
This time, go and do not come back!

310
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,200
I knew it, the incompetent one isn’t me.

311
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,640
It's you!

312
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,520
Wanna get into politics with a clean profile,

313
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,480
but turns out you got a murderer kid beyond control.

314
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,440
I'm not going with you!

315
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,520
Arrest me if you want,

316
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,920
so you can be the guardian of the people,

317
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,640
the one good guy,

318
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,520
like how you yap on TV.

319
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,280
Tin!

320
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,600
Prepare to move tomorrow night.

321
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,160
My man will contact you through this phone!

322
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,040
You don't have much choice.

323
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,480
Right now, society is questioning the police procedures.

324
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,680
Especially the special investigation department

325
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,920
that seems to have not caught the killer,

326
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,480
leading to the seventh horrifying death.

327
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
The victim was

328
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,720
Watcharin Trakulwipatkul.

329
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,880
Watcharin was 38 years old and a housewife.

330
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,160
Tin!

331
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,160
The fuck did you do!?

332
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,920
I know that this is your doing!

333
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,560
What do you mean, Dad?

334
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,000
Here, here!

335
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Why did you do it?

336
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,640
Answer me!

337
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
I said answer me!

338
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,280
Whores.

339
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,200
These whores are just like mom!

340
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,680
Good fucking riddance.

341
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,000
That you killed these people

342
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,120
might bring me trouble!

343
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,080
Trouble?

344
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,200
And what do I have to do with it?

345
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
You don’t even see me as your son.

346
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,120
Right!

347
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,040
I didn’t want to have a son like you!

348
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,280
I should’ve forced your mother to abort you.

349
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,760
So you wouldn’t be fucking me over like this!

350
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,240
You, listen!

351
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,240
if you don’t stop, I’ll put you in jail!

352
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,600
Tul will be sent to an orphanage.

353
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,840
You want that?!

354
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,600
Get out of the car!

355
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,480
Do not resist!

356
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,000
Get him out!

357
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,440
Now!

358
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,120
Now!

359
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,400
Get out of the car!

360
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,000
The fuck are you arresting me for!?

361
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,720
Get out!

362
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,360
Get out now!

363
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,680
The fuck is this!?

364
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,960
Arrest me for what!?

365
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,440
What are you arresting me for!?

366
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,400
On the ground!

367
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,240
Cuff him!

368
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,160
The fuck did I do!?

369
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,280
Cuff him.

370
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,800
You are the Raindrop Killer!

371
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,080
I didn't do it.

372
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,520
I didn't do it!

373
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,400
Go! Take him!

374
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,480
I didn't do it.

375
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,480
Go.

376
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,560
During the interrogation,

377
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,280
don’t forget to say as I told you.

378
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,440
I guarantee that you won’t be in jail for long.

379
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,440
You'll be out in no time.

380
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,600
Your wife and child,

381
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,880
I’ll take care of them.

382
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,640
Do you understand?

383
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,240
The killer is Wisut Saenjaisue,

384
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,720
a taxi driver who picked up the victims,

385
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,920
and tricked them into being killed.

386
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,520
Right now all the forensic evidence is pointing to Wisut.

387
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,000
The Raindrop Killer

388
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,800
has been caught.

389
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
This copycat case is very similar to the murders 18 years ago,

390
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,720
but Forensic states that there are still some differences.

391
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,080
Fucking incompetent.

392
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,880
Tul, look.

393
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,640
Hmm?

394
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,520
Hed ate the fish again.

395
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:46,960
Oh.

396
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,320
You wanna see the real deal?

397
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,160
[ ON THE MISDEEDS OF KULJIRA]

398
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,840
KULJIRA HIT-AND-RUN A DISABLED PERSON TO DEATH ]

399
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,040
Tin.

400
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,720
I got some important leads.

401
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,840
All due to my talent!

402
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,080
[ SEE YOU TONIGHT ]

403
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,280
[ LET'S MEET HERE ]

404
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Please don’t!

405
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,320
The way he looked at me was horrifying, you know?

406
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,320
It’s not how a brother looks at his sister’s girlfriend.

407
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,240
Put your weapon down.

408
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,080
Run!

409
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,200
Pick up, Run.

410
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,280
Run!

411
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,680
You are here,

412
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,280
just as I thought.

413
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,280
Move.

414
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,320
Run.

415
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,400
All this time, it must’ve been hard.

416
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,480
Thank you, Run.

417
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,880
Thank you for making me realize that I shouldn't betray myself,

418
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,000
shouldn’t’ve betrayed the promise I had with you.

419
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,080
From now on,

420
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,680
you don’t have to fight alone anymore.

421
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,480
Run, I will go catch Tin myself.

422
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,680
I’m not here only because I’m worried about you,

423
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,280
but also because

424
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,800
we need to finally make things right for everyone.

425
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,240
Please make yourself useful for once.

426
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,400
For the sake of police honour,

427
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,680
Can’t you do what’s right for once, Commander!?

428
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,480
You can't stop me.

429
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,840
Even if I’ve to put my own brother in jail,

430
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,600
I will catch the Raindrop Killer myself.
