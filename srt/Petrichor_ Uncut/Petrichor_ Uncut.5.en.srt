Meow~

5
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
Meow~

6
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Hed!

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,680
I was having a good dream!

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
You!

9
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,520
Go! Just get out.

10
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
Go!

11
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you awake?

12
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,240
Yeah.

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,200
It's so nice

14
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,680
to wake up and see you like this, Doc.

15
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,360
No.

16
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Not Doc, it's Run.

17
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,480
In the morning.

18
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,079
If you wake up but don't find me next to you,

19
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,880
what will you do?

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,280
I'll break into the hospital and ask the staff

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,640
who took 'my Run' away?

22
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,640
That's too much!

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm serious.

24
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,200
Go take a shower or else you'll be late.

25
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,040
Can I stay like this for a while?

26
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,200
Please?

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
Why are you so clingy today?

28
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,840
Go take a shower.

29
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Can't I have a second?

30
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,640
That's enough.

31
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,360
Go take a shower.

32
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,600
Join me then, huh?

33
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,640
No.

34
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,040
I'll go then.

35
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I don't want it to be just a dream.

36
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,159
Since Dr. Run is here,

37
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,960
please remind Tul to finish all her food.

38
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,240
She always rushes and only eats a bite or two
before heading out.

39
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,520
How can Tul not finish her meal

40
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,960
when you cook so well, Tin?

41
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,280
Well, if it's really delicious,

42
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,520
come by and eat more often, Doc.

43
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
Oh, and I bought this for you too.

44
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,000
Take some to Tul too.

45
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,080
Got it.

46
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,600
And also remind Tul that

47
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,320
don't eat them with a lot of coffee.

48
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,200
If she drinks too much coffee, she'll end up with migrain instead.

49
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,960
Okay.

50
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
This one too.

51
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
Her lips get dry often,

52
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,240
and she keeps losing her lipstick.

53
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,320
So I bought her new one. This one is for Tul.

54
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,800
This is for you, Dr. Run.

55
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
You have one for me too?

56
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,720
Yes.

57
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,560
Thank you, Tin.

58
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
Come here.

59
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,320
Let's eat.

60
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,000
You two are getting along so well!

61
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,640
I’ve never seen you chat this much when it’s just the two of us.

62
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Chat with Dr. Run is right.

63
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,760
Talking to you? You never really listen to me.

64
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,159
Tin, my hair is all messy!

65
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,600
I have to go to work.

66
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,600
I know.

67
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
Finish you food.

68
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,960
All right.

69
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,880
You often skip breakfast.

70
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
Delicious?

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
And then before you leave,

72
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
don't forget to grab some milk in the fridge.

73
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Get one for Run, too.

74
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
Roger that!

75
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,800
Tin bought this for you.

76
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
You both two for us?

77
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
Well, you take one. You lose it often.

78
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you.

79
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,040
Hello, Doctor Run.

80
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Hello.

81
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
Thank you for walking me here.

82
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
I should be thanking you more.

83
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,120
For letting me spending even a little more time with you.

84
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,120
Well,

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,320
you look cute in my shirt.

86
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,120
Anyway,

87
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,240
um...

88
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
does this mean we're officially a couple?

89
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,840
Isn't it clear?

90
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,280
I just want to hear it from you.

91
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
You want to know?

92
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,480
You're a cop,

93
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,080
so why don't you go and investigate it yourself?

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,799
And...

95
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,400
what about you, Tul?

96
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
You're a forensic doctor,

97
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,200
so bring your knife and cut my heart open.

98
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,440
But you won't find anything,

99
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,040
because I'm right here.

100
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,440
You're so poetic now, huh?

101
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,000
But didn't you forget that

102
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
I work with corpse.

103
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,840
Run!

104
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,440
Oh.

105
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
Don't forget to use it.

106
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,240
Uh-huh.

107
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm not sure what the future holds for us,

108
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,440
but one thing that I know for sure is

109
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,320
I want to have you in my life.

110
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,240
I want to build a life with you too.

111
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
I want to make you the happiest person in the world.

112
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,320
Like this?

113
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,920
Is it obvious enough?

114
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,640
Now you know what we are.

115
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
I promise you, Run.

116
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,040
I'll uncover the truth about the Raindrop Killer.

117
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,880
Remember that you're not alone.

118
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
You sill have me.

119
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
Me as a forensic doctor,

120
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,600
and also

121
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,040
as someone who will always be by your side.

122
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,720
Thank you.

123
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,120
But...

124
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,520
now that we’re at it,

125
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,600
can you call me 'P’ Tul' ?

126
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,400
P’

127
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,440
P' Tul.

128
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm so happy.

129
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,040
This is probably the first time that

130
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm this happy when someone calls me 'P'.

131
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,640
Your 'P' Tul'.

132
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Call me 'P' again, okay?

133
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,680
Who does P' Tul belong to?

134
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,440
Whose is this?

135
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
She is Nong Run's.

136
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
Speak politely.

137
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
You belong to who?

138
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm Nong Run's.

139
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,880
Happy?

140
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,200
Wait a sec.

141
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,920
What's up, Phu?

142
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,440
The case is closing?

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,280
I’ll head there right away.

144
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,440
Kuljira's case is about to be closed.

145
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,440
A witness has confirmed that Wisut is the culprit.

146
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,240
A witness?

147
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,480
Um,

148
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,040
but a witness appear out of nowhere like this,

149
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,880
I think

150
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,920
there must be something behind all of this.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,720
I've already followed your order.

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,840
Now we've got the witness.

153
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,160
We just need to make Wisut confess.

154
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,520
Good.

155
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
Just handle it like we did 18 years ago, and it’ll be over.

156
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,400
Yes, sir.

157
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,200
What's wrong?

158
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,720
Are you scared?

159
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,080
No, sir.

160
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,320
I’m just not entirely confident about this method.

161
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,600
Then it means that you’re not committed enough.

162
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,360
Worrying

163
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
doesn't help anything.

164
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,360
You need to quickly close the case.

165
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,680
Otherwise, who knows what consequence you will face.

166
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,360
I can't help you.

167
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Yes, sir.

168
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
And who's taking care of this case?

169
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,240
Inspector Dansiam's team.

170
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,000
As for Inspector Tul,

171
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,920
I assign her to handle Dansiam 's other cases.

172
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,400
But I believe if she's still around like this,

173
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
it'll be risky.

174
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,080
Don't do anything.

175
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,840
Keeping her out of this case is enough.

176
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,880
Yes, sir.

177
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,840
Tul, the witness claims they saw a man resembling Wisut lurking around Kuljira’s house.

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,600
Now, it’s just a matter of getting Wisut’s confession.

179
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,160
But Wisut and Kuljira have nothing to do with each other.

180
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,920
Will Wisut suddenly turn to kill some random
bad people just like that?

181
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,840
I think Dansiam’s team was forcing Wisut
to confess to being the murderer.

182
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,280
The other day I went to see Wisut,

183
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,880
he said he's never killed a single victim.

184
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,840
They were just his taxi customers,

185
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,680
except for the sixth victim, whom he admitted to sleep with.

186
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,440
So, it’s possible the witness testimony was fabricated.

187
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,880
You believe in what Wisut said?

188
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,880
Hey, I found it.

189
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,200
Jiu.

190
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,680
Investigation report for the case 18 years ago.

191
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,680
Take a look at it.

192
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,440
Tul,

193
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
according to the report,

194
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,120
the key evidence pinning Wisut as the murderer

195
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,640
was a shoeprint found at the crime scene.

196
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,080
Since he was a taxi driver,

197
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,840
he often drove around that area.

198
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,240
But later, the police

199
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,480
had expanded the case

200
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,040
and found out that he had a relationship with the sixth victim,

201
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,720
the case expanded to the others.

202
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,280
But as far as I look,

203
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,680
there’s little to no link between Wisut and the crimes.

204
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,560
Tul! These are the shoes.

205
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,040
These shoes were expensive back then, weren’t they?

206
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,320
Wisut had good taste, huh?

207
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,560
That's true. I really wanted to have one back then.

208
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,680
It's so cool!

209
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,560
Wait.

210
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,560
But would someone like Wisut buy such expensive shoes?

211
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,640
Or could they be knock-offs, which were everywhere at the time?

212
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,480
Phu, hand me the picture.

213
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,920
Look at this.

214
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,680
The shoeprints in the photos

215
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,240
don’t match these shoes.

216
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Yeah, it's not really the same.

217
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,520
Even at first glance they may look the same.

218
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,160
Or it's really like what Tul said that Wisut wore a knock-off?

219
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,319
That means...

220
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,560
Exactly!

221
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,800
The crime scene shoeprints

222
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,560
were from authentic branded shoes.

223
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,520
That means

224
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,880
the evidence implicating Wisut was fake.

225
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,160
He was never the real culprit for 18 years.

226
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,800
Now you think you're a hero, huh?

227
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,880
So you decided to switch from killing prostitutes to killing
rich people with criminal records instead?

228
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,880
Oh,

229
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,120
you probably think

230
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,200
killing those people will help you become a hero

231
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,840
instead?

232
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,800
Hey!

233
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,800
You aren't gonna talk, right?

234
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,040
Then suffer like this, you bastard!

235
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,240
Hey, what are you doing?

236
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Isn't it a little too much, Inspector?

237
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,640
Wisut.

238
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,840
Wisut.

239
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,160
Are you okay?

240
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Wisut.

241
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,360
Wisut!

242
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,680
I’m going to report this to the higher-ups.

243
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,440
Let me have a word with you.

244
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,680
The order to make Wisut confess

245
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
came from above.

246
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,480
Do you think they will care?

247
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,120
Even if they don’t,

248
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,800
the least you can do is act like a decent cop.

249
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,720
Those high-ranking officers

250
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,720
or anyone who gets promoted has gone through things like this.

251
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,800
And you keep following their path just like that, Inspector?

252
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,480
Don’t you ever think about fixing things?

253
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,000
Have you ever asked yourself

254
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,840
why did you become a cop at the first place?

255
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,680
Because of scum like him.

256
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,080
See that?

257
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,920
Stubborn criminals who refuse to talk.

258
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,280
When you dig deeper, it’s always them.

259
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,000
Using tough methods is just how I deal with them.

260
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,800
But you have no right to use violence.

261
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
If I report to the media

262
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,280
that you tortured a suspect into confessing,

263
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,040
do you think

264
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
those higher-ups

265
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,720
you’re so loyal to

266
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,600
will still back you?

267
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,600
Are you threatening me?

268
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Let's find out then,

269
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
if it’s just a threat or not.

270
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Well, go ahead.

271
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,280
Do it.

272
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,400
Tell the media. Tell whoever you want.

273
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,480
You know why?

274
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,000
I’m curious to see who will get thrown under the bus first

275
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,040
me or you.

276
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,480
Tul,

277
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,240
If you want to stay in this profession, you better learn to play the game

278
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,200
Otherwise, just resign

279
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,480
and move to some other country with the system you admire so much.

280
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,840
Listen to me, Inspector.

281
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm not going anywhere.

282
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
I’m staying to do my job...

283
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,280
under the law.

284
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,680
Fine!

285
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,440
Phu, all the cameras are off, right?

286
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,080
It's all done!

287
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,800
Okay. Thanks.

288
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,280
This pair of shoes is yours, right?

289
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
You bought these expensive sneakers for thousands of baht?

290
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
What the fuck are you talking about?

291
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,600
I got them at the market for a few hundred baht.

292
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,880
Saw young people wearing them, so I got a pair too.

293
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,040
Do you know the brand and model of these shoes?

294
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,240
What brand?

295
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,080
What? Who remembers stuff like that?

296
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,640
Can't remember or you don't know?

297
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,840
I don't know!

298
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,560
In your confession 18 years ago,

299
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,560
it was documented that you could identify the brand.

300
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,040
Were you lying back then?

301
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,240
I don't know the brand.

302
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
I just bought one.

303
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
Everyone wore it that time.

304
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,920
So what were you doing at Kuljira's house.

305
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,240
I’ve told you a hundred times

306
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,840
I was with a prostitute.

307
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,480
After that, I grabbed some food,

308
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
stopped by a relative’s house to pick up my stuff

309
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,200
and left.

310
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,880
I don’t even know

311
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,160
who Kuljira is!

312
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
A relative?

313
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

314
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,640
I went to my relative’s house to pick up something.

315
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,200
Hey, Mr. Wisut,

316
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,440
why didn't you tell this to the police?

317
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,640
You could’ve had an alibi.

318
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,240
I didn’t want the cops bothering my relatives.

319
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,440
So the last question,

320
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,360
can I have your relatives' address?

321
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Phu, what's up?

322
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,760
Wisut has confessed.

323
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,880
What happened?

324
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,920
There's CCTV footage

325
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,120
showing Wisut wandering near the road by Kuljira’s house.

326
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
Plus, there’s a witness who identified him.

327
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,320
But honestly,

328
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
I think Wisut confessed because he was beaten.

329
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,320
What should we do now?

330
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,720
Well, if they don't play by the rules,

331
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,640
we will do the same.

332
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,480
If we leak this news, Tul,

333
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
I think the higher-ups will come after you.

334
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,520
Are you sure you’re ready for that?

335
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,600
It's all right, Run.

336
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,800
I just want to bring the real culprit to justice.

337
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
Not someone like Wisut, a scapegoat.

338
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
This is just like what Dansiam and Commander Pichet

339
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,640
are about to do again.

340
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Honestly, the worst person in this whole mess is Big Tech.

341
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,240
The others are just his lackeys following orders.

342
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,600
Are you okay?

343
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,240
Why are you suddenly quiet?

344
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,680
It's nothing.

345
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,600
You're right.

346
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,880
Not all cops

347
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,840
are good people.

348
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,240
Why do you feel bad about this?

349
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,840
You’re not like Big Tech and his crew, right?

350
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,880
Yeah, I'm not like them.

351
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,120
We are outside, Tul!

352
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,280
Okay.

353
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,920
Let's go.

354
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,120
Go.

355
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,640
Inspector Tul has something to talk to you.

356
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,000
They’re using violent and dirty tactics to pressure Wisut into
confessing to being the killer.

357
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,000
On top of that, they’ve fabricated evidence.

358
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,320
You're talking about Kuljira's case, right?

359
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,320
Yes.

360
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,000
I believe Wisut is not the real culprit.

361
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,040
Someone is trying to frame him and close this case quickly,

362
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,640
leaving the real perpetrator free.

363
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,640
According to the autopsy, time of death is approximately

364
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,440
at 9:00 p.m.

365
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,480
We found a  CCTV  footage showing Wisut walking along the street
at around 9.00 p.m.

366
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,840
That is also the time of Kuljira's death.

367
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,120
It's impossible for Wisut to kill Kuljira

368
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,520
because the places are so far apart.

369
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,440
I want to do what's right within the justice system.

370
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,200
But all this, I can't do it alone.

371
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,080
I need your help.

372
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,840
I believe you want to do the right thing too.

373
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,240
I can only provide you with information that won’t compromise the case.

374
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,560
I'll try to help as much as I can.

375
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,040
But you're aware of the consequence that may follow, right?

376
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,200
Change always comes with consequences. I’m ready for them.

377
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,000
So...

378
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,640
I may excuse myself.

379
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,280
Run, I need to talk to you.

380
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,280
So...

381
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,400
I'll wait for you downstairs.

382
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
Be honest, Run.

383
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,400
You didn’t come with Inspector Tul

384
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,000
just because you’re close to me

385
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,080
and wanted to keep her company, did you?

386
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,320
Tul is investigating the case 18 years ago.

387
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
It's invloved my mom's case.

388
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,720
And the case also involved with Wisut as well.

389
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,040
Actually I believe that he is innocent.

390
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,880
No.

391
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,280
I didn't mean that.

392
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
What I'm asking is

393
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
what kind of relationship

394
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,600
between you and Tul is?

395
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,040
Well,

396
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,040
Tul and I, we are dating.

397
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,000
Sorry for not telling you earlier.

398
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,120
It's okay.

399
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,120
I could tell from what I saw earlier in the room.

400
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,440
Run, don't worry.

401
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,440
No matter what,

402
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,680
you'll always be my little sister.

403
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Thank you.

404
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,480
Release a scoop on elementary school kids caught with e-cigarettes.

405
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,200
I'll take the celebrity news to break up too.

406
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,360
Hold on.

407
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,600
Ow!

408
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,640
Just release anything dramatic to drown this out.

409
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,600
Got it?

410
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,440
Yes.

411
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,320
Literally no one I can trust.

412
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,880
Hello, sir.

413
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,640
You know why I’m calling, right?

414
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,800
Yes, yes, I know.

415
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,800
Uh, about the news.

416
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,320
We're handling it, sir.

417
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,240
Fire her!

418
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,520
That reporter.

419
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,080
Fired?

420
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,640
Isn't it too harsh, sir?

421
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,880
Maybe it was just a misunderstanding.

422
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,000
Do you want me to revoke all your sponsors
or stop covering for your company?

423
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,560
Keep your media in line,

424
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,840
or next time SR NEWS will be just a name.

425
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
Hold on, sir.

426
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,960
Damn it!

427
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,400
Another police misconduct incident, everyone!

428
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,760
A video clip has surfaced showing physical assault on Wisut,

429
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,760
who is currently a suspect in the Kuljira murder case.

430
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:43,560
Let's take a look. You can clearly see two male officers punching
the suspect in the stomach,

431
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,680
with someone who appears to be their superior overseeing it.

432
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Yes,  Boom.  But in this clip you can see

433
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,440
it wasn’t just the male officers.

434
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,480
A female officer joined in as well.

435
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,840
She appeared to intervene, or do something

436
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,800
and then the male officers had to pull her away.

437
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,880
Let’s now hear from Pol. Maj. Gen. Pichet Horrapitakkul for clarification.

438
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,440
As seen on social media,

439
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,680
we still can't conclude that

440
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,360
both of them have use violence against Wisut.

441
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,720
We’ll need to investigate further before making conclusions
about their alleged assault.

442
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,480
If true,

443
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,000
they will face strict disciplinary action.

444
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,880
Fuck!

445
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,240
As for the allegations that we fabricated alibis and
evidence about Visut’s shoes,

446
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,560
those are false.

447
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,240
The Special Investigation Bureau

448
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,360
has credible evidence and witnesses confirming Wisut’s involvement
in the murder of Kuljira.

449
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,320
Lastly, I urge everyone to avoid spreading fake news

450
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,880
or inciting hatred.

451
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,520
Tul,

452
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Are you okay?

453
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm okay.

454
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,840
But no media outlet is talking about the fabricated evidence
that Dansiam and his superior created.

455
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,159
Didn’t think the tide would turn and hit you, huh?

456
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,639
In the end, you’re caught in it too.

457
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,239
Why don’t we let Visut tell the truth?

458
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,120
Then everyone will know

459
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,199
who the real corrupt cop is.

460
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,040
Inspector.

461
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,239
Let me ask you something.

462
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,719
Are you sure you’re confident in what you did?

463
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,480
Yes!

464
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm confident.

465
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,719
At least it shakes the rotten system here.

466
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,719
The public must be proud of having such diligent officers in our country.

467
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,160
Officers who overstep and dedicate themselves beyond their duty.

468
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,400
Officers who don’t care about what their superiors think.

469
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,480
Officers

470
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,080
who don’t care about the troubles they create for other teams.

471
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:17,320
I hear Team 3 has been so dedicated to their work
that they’ve crossed the line into Inspector Dansiam’s case.

472
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
You guys work this hard,

473
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,520
maybe it’s time I give Team 3 a little break from work, don’t you think?

474
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,440
Commander, sir, it's on me only.

475
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,600
Others are not involved.

476
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,440
If you meddle in this case again,

477
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,480
both you and your team

478
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,680
can prepare to be unemployed.

479
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,760
Ouch, it hurts.

480
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
This way.

481
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,840
It's not fair.

482
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,080
Why don’t Dansiam’s team get in trouble too?

483
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,720
Yeah! And now they’re dragging your name into the mud.

484
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,560
Who leaked that angle to the media?

485
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,040
Forget it.

486
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,280
At least we’ve made some progress,

487
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,000
and

488
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,400
the public is starting to question Dansiam’s actions.

489
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,680
I’m sorry you guys have to go through this with me.

490
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,280
We are the same team.

491
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,960
We’ll go through this together.

492
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,000
Exactly! This is nothing, Tul.

493
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,520
But it's mean you might get fired?

494
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,240
Nah, come on.

495
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,440
Jiu, come on.

496
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,840
Tul.

497
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,960
Come on!

498
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,240
Let's do it.

499
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
We, Team 3.

500
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,520
We, Team 3, we got this!

501
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,040
Whoa.

502
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,000
Wait a sec. I'll be right back.

503
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Where are you going?

504
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,840
May.

505
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,640
What brings you here?

506
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,440
I heard about Inspector Tul

507
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,800
so I come by to have a look.

508
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,200
Here you go.

509
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,160
These are for Tul and Phu. Take them in, okay?

510
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,840
Only for Tul and Phu? What about me?

511
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,400
Don’t I get any?

512
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,400
Well,

513
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,800
if you want to eat, eat.

514
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,520
Just make sure you share.

515
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,520
So, how’s Tul doing?

516
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,680
She’s fine. Strong as ever.

517
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,200
Nothing can bring her down easily.

518
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,560
Oh, yeah.

519
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,040
Don't you worry about me?

520
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,520
Alright, I’m heading off.

521
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,720
Take care of yourself, Captain.

522
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,600
Don't give me that look.

523
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,120
I’m not worried about you.

524
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,640
I just don’t want to keep changing new colleague all the time.

525
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,440
That's it.

526
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,080
I'm heading off.

527
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,440
Couldn't hide your smile, huh?

528
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Whose is that?

529
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,040
Mae dropped by and got us these snacks.

530
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,040
She saw the news and wanted to check on us

531
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,200
so she dropped by.

532
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,680
Well, well, well.

533
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,960
You look so pleased.

534
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,240
If it’s like this,

535
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,240
why don’t you just ask her out already?

536
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,240
What are you waiting for?

537
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm trying!

538
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,840
What else can I do?

539
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,840
She's drawn the line that she only wants to be just colleagues.

540
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,120
Oh, come on.

541
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,680
Even parallel lines like Tul and Dr. Run

542
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,920
found a way to intersect.

543
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,320
Oh!

544
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,080
Phu!

545
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
What? What about me and Dr. Run?

546
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,720
Huh?

547
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,680
Stop dragging me into this.

548
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
And if Jiu wants to make a move,

549
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,440
let her do it on her own.

550
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,680
It has nothing to do with you, got it?

551
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,040
So you're a master who knows all about love?

552
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,480
Hey.

553
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,840
That's it.

554
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,920
Just redraw the line. It’s worth a shot.

555
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,720
Go.

556
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,120
Trust me.

557
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,240
You called me here. Did something happen?

558
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,520
Yes it is.

559
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,560
Did you even think this through before doing something like this?

560
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,000
You didn’t consider me or the other executives at all.

561
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,720
You’ve already had your program pulled from the schedule.

562
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,640
I warned you not to blow up stories about police misconduct.

563
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,160
We’re journalists.

564
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,240
Isn’t it our job to present the truth

565
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,240
fairly and accurately?

566
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,200
Didn’t you feel anything when you saw the footage
of the police assaulting Wisut?

567
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,080
I want you to understand that sponsorships and backing

568
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,840
are what keep this station afloat.

569
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,000
There have to be other ways, Met.

570
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,880
I can’t just blindly write biased stories to praise them over and over.

571
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,080
Tiwa!

572
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,040
How long have you been working here?

573
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,480
Do you really think

574
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,640
we’ve survived all this time on our own?

575
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,960
When we need help,

576
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,440
it’s those powerful people who come through for us.

577
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,480
We return the favor by crafting narratives that maintain their image.

578
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,560
That's right.

579
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,640
This system of patronage and connections is what keep us alive.

580
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,320
Don't you feel ashamed?

581
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,440
Flattering them like that?

582
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,320
Going hungry or losing your dignity,

583
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,520
what’s more shameful, Tiwa?

584
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,440
Honestly, your attitude

585
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,160
doesn’t suit this place anymore.

586
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,520
Sumet...

587
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,000
Pack your things

588
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,160
and leave.

589
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,800
I don’t want to see you here again.

590
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,640
To be honest, I don’t want to stay in a newsroom
so blinded by money, either.

591
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,400
Let’s go our separate ways and do what we each believe in.

592
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,240
And when the day you fall comes,

593
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,360
I’ll be watching to see

594
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,400
if those powerful people even lift a finger to help you.

595
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,840
Tiwa!

596
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,880
Are you on duty today? Oh, no.

597
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,200
Oh, no.

598
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,880
I saw that you haven't go home yet, so I bought Bua-loy for you.

599
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,000
Thank you.

600
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,040
Run, are you overworking yourself with the special investigation cases?

601
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,200
Not at all. I'm fine.

602
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,400
I just feel like the closer we get to the truth,

603
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,520
the more we’re blocked at every turn, like it’s getting farther away.

604
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,440
Run,

605
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,800
I understand your standpoint.

606
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,000
And I know

607
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,920
how important uncovering the truth about your mom is to you.

608
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
But you need to be careful.

609
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,720
Word has it that people higher up

610
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,440
are already keeping an eye on what the forensic department is investigating.

611
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,240
I’m not saying this to discourage you.

612
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,120
I’m here for you no matter what.

613
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,840
But before taking any steps,

614
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,440
you need to think carefully.

615
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,440
I don’t want you to make the same mistakes I did.

616
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,520
Dad loves you.

617
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,240
You startled me!

618
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,080
It's just a small matter.

619
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,280
Smile for me.

620
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,040
Tin bought this for you.

621
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,040
Thank you.

622
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,600
You need to thank Tin, not me.

623
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,800
Tul, are you okay?

624
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,480
If something bothers you,

625
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,320
just tell me.

626
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,680
No matter how much I want to know what really happened in the past,

627
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,840
I don't want to it to affect your work.

628
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,000
I heard that

629
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,840
the forensics department also got a warning, didn’t they?

630
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,400
See?

631
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,320
Everything I’ve done

632
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,440
has affected you as well.

633
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,080
You’re always comforting others,

634
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,800
but you never tell me what’s bothering you.

635
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,640
It's no big deal.

636
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,640
My dad just gave me a little warning to be more careful.

637
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,240
I guess I’ll have to tone it down for a while.

638
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,600
I didn't do all of this just because of you.

639
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,480
I did it for myself too.

640
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,320
What is not right

641
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,680
needs to be fixed.

642
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,680
Another thing,

643
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,240
because I've got you,

644
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,480
it's like the weight of the world has been lifted.

645
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,120
Then, why  are you carrying the weight of the world?

646
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,400
I won't anymore.

647
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,400
Okay?

648
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,840
Sweet talker.

649
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,200
Thank you.

650
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,920
I just want you to be sure

651
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,480
that I'm really okay.

652
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,840
Look, you mouth is all chapped.

653
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,720
Pucker your lips for me.

654
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,920
The color isn't as pigmeted.

655
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,320
Let me see.

656
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,360
What!

657
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
It's late, won't you head back home?

658
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,160
Can I stay like this for a while?

659
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,560
Not thinking about anything. It's relaxing.

660
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,720
Can I?

661
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,000
Hey! Hey!

662
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,520
What the fuck?

663
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,240
You think you're so smart, huh?

664
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,720
Love messing with other people's business, huh?

665
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,240
Let me go!

666
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,120
You're such a nosy parker.

667
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,080
I told you not to be nosy.

668
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,640
What the fuck are you doing with my sis?

669
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,480
Hey!

670
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,640
Don't ask for trouble.

671
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,280
Help!

672
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,280
Somebody helps!

673
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,080
If you don't stop,

674
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,280
you’ll get worse than this next time!

675
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,960
Hey!

676
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,160
Let's go back.

677
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,640
Ouch.

678
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,040
It hurts.

679
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,640
Tin

680
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,720
who are you calling?

681
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,120
The police.

682
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,320
I'll put them all in jail.

683
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,600
Don't call, Tin

684
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,520
It's all useless.

685
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,080
I know the ones who sent those men,

686
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,560
it's the police themselves.

687
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,000
They must be upset that I told the reporters about this.

688
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
This is going too far, Tul.

689
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,800
They’re harassing us in front of our house!

690
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,280
I swear, I’ll find a way to deal with them!

691
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,960
Hey!

692
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,720
Tin.

693
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,720
Calm down.

694
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,760
Breathe in.

695
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,160
Deep breath. In and out.

696
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,160
Come here, come here.

697
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,040
Sit first.

698
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,840
Take a seat.

699
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,240
Hey!

700
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,480
you’re ruining your image.

701
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,680
I’m fine, nothing happened to me.

702
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,000
But you shouldn’t have to deal with things like this.

703
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,200
I can handle this.

704
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,040
But the way they’re treating you like this? I’m not okay with it.

705
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,480
Don’t worry about me.

706
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,920
Worry about yourself first.

707
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,240
Tin.

708
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,080
If I didn’t have you taking care of me,

709
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
what would have happened?

710
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,800
So you're still acting all sweet, huh?

711
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,040
Don't you have Run already?

712
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,920
No, not like a girlfriend,

713
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,080
I mean a big brother—the most wonderful one in the world.

714
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,880
Where could I find?

715
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,080
Girlfriend?

716
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,480
Come here.

717
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,320
Tin,

718
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,440
I think

719
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,800
maybe I should move out for a while.

720
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,360
I’m afraid those people might come back and hurt you too.

721
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,240
At least I'm here to help you.

722
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Look at yourself right now. Still think you can help me, huh?

723
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,240
If they gang up on us,

724
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,120
we won’t stand a chance.

725
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,640
Fine.

726
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,200
But you have to promise me that

727
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,680
you'll always be available if I contact you, okay?

728
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,440
Yes, sir!

729
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,080
Why are you back so early?

730
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,680
I just got back from work right before you did.

731
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
What happened to your face?

732
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,000
Some guys came to threaten me at home last night.

733
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
Then why didn't you tell me?

734
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,680
Would you have gotten there in time if I had?

735
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,440
Tul, I'm serious.

736
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,040
Sorry.

737
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,800
And where else does it hurt?

738
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,680
Here.

739
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,080
And here.

740
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,280
Does it hurt so much?

741
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,080
Have you seen the doctor?

742
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,520
Here I am.

743
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,120
Coming to see a doctor.

744
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,240
Don't worry.

745
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,520
I'm okay.

746
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,800
Tin came to help, so he got caught up in it too.

747
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,440
Next time

748
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,880
something like this happens, you have to tell me immediately.

749
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,800
Okay?

750
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,520
Okay.

751
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,840
It's good to have someone who cares.

752
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,320
Are you done?

753
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,880
Yeah.

754
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,200
And what will you do next?

755
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,720
I'll have to move out for a while.

756
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,520
I don't want Tin to get caught up in this again.

757
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,640
At least,

758
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,800
they won’t go after anyone else unless they’re their target.

759
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,760
Where are you going?

760
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,400
I'm looking for hotels around here. I've brought my stuff too.

761
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,800
Then why didn't you come here and stay with me?

762
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,240
No. I can't.

763
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,440
I don't want you to get into trouble too.

764
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,000
I won't.

765
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,040
You can take care of yourself.

766
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,040
And so can Dad and I.

767
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,440
Also, didn't you tell me that

768
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,160
those guys wouldn’t risk targeting anyone else?

769
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,720
They wouldn’t want

770
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,960
a forensic doctor to suddenly get hurt.

771
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,280
Tul,

772
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,720
I know that even if the Commander warns you, you’ll
stubbornly keep working on this case.

773
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,200
A lot more is going to happen,

774
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:19,840
and

775
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,320
I’ll be here, standing beside you and

776
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,640
supporting you as you fight against this injustice.

777
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,040
Thank you.

778
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,600
We will get through this together.

779
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,440
It's the front hook, babe.

780
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,680
It's like what happened in my dream.

781
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,680
What are you dreaming of?

782
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,240
I won't tell you.

783
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,840
I want to be here with you more often.

784
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,640
You can come every day if you’d like.

785
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,840
If that's the case,

786
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,240
should I move in?

787
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,640
Don't forget to bring Hed too.

788
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,080
Ah, so you just want to see the cat every day,

789
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,240
not me!

790
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,800
You're so jealousy!

791
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,440
Speaking of which, I wonder how Jiu is doing now.

792
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,640
Phu and Jiu are planning to visit May today.

793
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,040
That's it.

794
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,480
They’ve been circling each other for ages.

795
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,440
I hope they finally get together.

796
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,840
Like us?

797
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,240
Something like that.

798
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,080
What’s wrong, Tul?

799
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,040
I have a bad feeling about this.

800
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,120
May.

801
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,400
You haven't eaten yet?

802
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,000
This is...?

803
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,440
You bought this as a way to repay me?

804
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,280
No.

805
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,040
You often work late and forget to eat,

806
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,840
I bought it so we can eat together.

807
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,520
And then...

808
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,240
Why did you bought these flowers?

809
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,000
For the shrine? I heard this area has powerful spirits, you know.

810
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,440
Hey.

811
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,040
Just kidding.

812
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,800
Well,

813
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,120
I

814
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,320
saw them while walking by, thought they were pretty,

815
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,040
so I bought them.

816
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,320
Captain.

817
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,240
Tell me honestly,

818
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,280
aren't you tired putting this much of effort?

819
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,800
Our relationship was over since college.

820
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,040
What about you, May?

821
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,240
I've tried this hard already,

822
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,400
don't you feel anything?

823
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,080
Tell me,

824
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,880
if one day I disappeared from your life completely,

825
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
would you miss me?

826
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,640
What are you trying to say?

827
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,480
We work together,

828
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,000
so we’ll see each other often

829
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,200
no matter what.

830
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,040
May

831
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,200
The lab results got disrupted again. Looks like contamination.

832
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,800
Can you come take a look?

833
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,480
Uh, I have to go.

834
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,280
Hello?

835
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,640
Okay. I'll be there in 30 minutes.

836
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,440
I'm leaving now.

837
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,280
What!?

838
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,600
Phu, what's up?

839
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,960
Hello, Tul.

840
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,040
Jiu went to find the victim's relatives,

841
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,640
but now I can't contact her.

842
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,960
How did the relative contact Jiu?

843
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,920
He contacted Jiu directly.

844
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,800
But I tried tracking her location.

845
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,040
and I found it's near the Heaven Living.

846
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,440
Send me the location.

847
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,280
And call for backup.

848
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,400
I'll be there soon.

849
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,160
Got it.

850
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,160
It's right here.

851
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,680
But do you think it's really the Raindrop Killer?

852
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,880
Not yet. But we have to be cautious.

853
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,640
But Jiu doesn’t seem to match the profile of his previous victims.

854
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,960
Let’s just hope nothing has happened yet.

855
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,840
This area is mostly buildings.

856
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,720
There doesn’t seem to be a good spot for commiting a crime?

857
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,640
Go that way.

858
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,040
Run, let's go.

859
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,680
Help me!

860
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,920
Somebody helps!

861
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:28,279
Stop!

862
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,439
Jiu!

863
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,560
Captain.

864
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,640
Jiu! Captain!

865
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,120
Can you hear me?

866
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,760
Tul.

867
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,520
She's unconscious.

868
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,120
She lost a lot of blood too.

869
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,160
Phu, take care of Jiu.

870
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,560
Captain!

871
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,040
Jiu!

872
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:02,720
Jiu!

873
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,440
Hello.

874
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,440
1669, right?

875
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,000
Stop.

876
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,320
I told you to stop!

877
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,120
Stop it!

878
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,520
Drop your weapon.

879
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:55,880
Drop you weapon!

880
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,920
The next shot won’t miss!

881
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,400
Kneel down and drop your weapon.

882
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,840
Now!

883
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,640
Tul, Tul!

884
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,040
Tul, Tul, where does it hurt?

885
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,440
Tul.

886
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,680
Jiu. Please stay strong!

887
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,600
You're with doctors now!

888
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,280
Tul.

889
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,880
How are Inspector Tul and Jiu?

890
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,160
Inspector Tul was stabbed but luckily it was just a graze on the left side.

891
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,360
Captain Jiu was hit in the head.

892
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,280
They're probably doing a CT scan.

893
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,680
We have to wait for the results.

894
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,520
If one day I disappeared from you life completely,

895
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,920
would you miss me?

896
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,920
Jiu, you have to be okay.

897
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,240
Please, I beg you.

898
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,240
Does it hurt?

899
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,600
A little.

900
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,640
It’s just a graze.

901
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,080
My heart’s still intact.

902
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,480
Still joking, huh?

903
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,920
But it's a pity.

904
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,640
We are so close

905
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,640
to see the real killer's face.

906
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,680
It’s lucky it was just a graze

907
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,120
and not a direct stab.

908
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,800
What if the culprit had gone crazy and attacked again?

909
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:45,880
Are you worried about me?

910
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,600
If it were me in your place,

911
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,840
wouldn’t you worry?

912
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,800
I'm worried.

913
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,600
But don’t say things like that.

914
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,520
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

915
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,520
Me too.

916
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,040
If I didn’t care, if I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t be here.

917
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,920
How are you? Is everything okay?

918
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,440
I didn't tell Tin I’m in the hospital.

919
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:27,520
I don’t want him to worry.

920
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,240
Everything's good.

921
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,640
This means

922
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,520
Wisut who is in custody isn’t the real culprit, right?

923
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,160
Hey!

924
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,640
I'm the person in charge of this case.

925
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,280
What you are doing will get me in trouble!

926
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,760
It all comes down to this

927
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,480
because of your own stubbornness!

928
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,760
You want to be a hero.

929
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,280
I think we should take a break.

930
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,640
I need some time to think.

931
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,520
It's better we don't see each other for now.

932
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,840
Tin!
