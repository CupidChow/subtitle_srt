3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,520
Tonight, the police found the body

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
of the seventh victim of the Raindrop Killer.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,280
This time is different from the others.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,880
because the victim

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,520
is Mrs. Watcharin Trakulwipatkul,

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,760
the wife of Dr. Rak Trakulwipatkul,

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,520
a famous forensic doctor who used to work on the case.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,560
The body was found in a bush.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,480
Mom!

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
Mom won't come back to us, right? Dad.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,080
This body has been hit precisely at the Pterion.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,080
just like the case 18 years ago.

15
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,680
Doc, are you okay?

16
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
I've been through worse.

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,320
So, how are the autopsy results?

18
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
The cause of death is

19
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,160
brain hemorrhage

20
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,120
caused by a single skull fracture at the Pterion.

21
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,240
All the victim’s fingers had one joint cut off and were burned to remove fingerprints.

22
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,560
The rope tying the hands was looped three times
and then knotted.

23
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,960
That matches the Raindrop Killer’s MO from 18 years ago, doesn’t it?"

24
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,960
Can we identify the deceased?

25
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
Not yet.

26
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,120
There are no fingerprints left.

27
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,760
The face was smashed to the point of unrecognizable.

28
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,680
So we'll have to wait

29
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,120
to match DNA with family members

30
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,760
who report a missing person, right?

31
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,440
That’ll take days.

32
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240
In a normal situation, yes.

33
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,120
But I've come up with a faster way.

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,720
Usually we use fingerprints to identify the deceased.

35
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
But in this case, we can't do that.

36
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,080
This silicone can help us.

37
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,640
Modern breast implants, especially newer models,

38
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,120
often come with microchips that provide more information
about the implant’s model.

39
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
Whoa,Doc.

40
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,440
That's awesome.

41
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,080
Could you send me the microship?

42
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
I'll have the team investigate right away.

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,760
Everything is in here.

44
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,520
Thank you, Doc.

45
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,280
Well,

46
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,560
I own you a meal for thank you,

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,440
last time we missed it,

48
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,360
but this time, it’s happening.

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,440
It's okay.

50
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm just doing my job.

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Thank you, anyway.

52
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,080
Don't back out.

53
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,080
It’s happening. That’s settled.

54
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
See you later.

55
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,520
May, an officer is here for blood test results.

56
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
Do cops not understand how things work?

57
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,840
What do you need, Captain Jiu?

58
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,280
Why do you sound so distant?

59
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,640
Aren't you here because of work?

60
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,480
What lab results are you rushing for today?

61
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,280
I want to come here because of other things too,

62
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,720
but I don't have any excuse.

63
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
So why are you here actually?

64
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
I want to know about the toxicology report for the lastest case.

65
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,280
How many more times do I have to tell you, huh?

66
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,280
You should ask Run,

67
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,280
not me.

68
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,640
Well, May.

69
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,840
Do you still remember that time

70
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,720
when you told me you wanted to try that homemade pizza shop?

71
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
I never got to take you there.

72
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah, I remember.

73
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,560
Why are you bringing up old memories?

74
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,120
That place is probably closed by now.

75
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
It's not.

76
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,760
They just opened a new branch nearby.

77
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,040
Want to go together?

78
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,200
We better not.

79
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,440
I’m avoiding carbs lately.

80
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,080
Not eating pizza is fine.

81
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
Take this then.

82
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,760
This is from the famous porridge shop that you used to like.

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
I queued up for ages to get it for you.

84
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,680
Take it back, Captain.

85
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,680
Food and drinks are not allowed inside the lab.

86
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,080
If you have no other business,

87
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
it's best you leave.

88
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Oh, and...

89
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,880
one more thing,

90
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,159
you don't have to buy me things like these again.

91
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,880
I don’t like them anymore.

92
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,360
May,

93
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,520
why are you so mean to Captain Jiu?

94
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Why don't you give her another chance?

95
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
Another chance, huh?

96
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,720
I already gave her one during the uni days.

97
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
But our chemistry just doesn't match;

98
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,760
it's like trying to mix water and oil together.

99
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,680
But Captain Jiu seems genuinely concerned about you.

100
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,120
A pretty girl like me has to move on

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,440
and look for someone better.

102
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,080
Suit yourself. Go find someone new like you said.

103
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Anyway, how about you and Inspector Tul?

104
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,880
How’s your chemistry?

105
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
Or… have you two already—

106
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,160
sleep together?

107
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,080
What the heck are you talking about?

108
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,880
Nah, come on.

109
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
I just want to know.

110
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
She and I have nothing to do with each other.

111
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,640
Enough.

112
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,280
Get back to work and have the toxicology results ready
 by tomorrow morning,

113
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,120
got it?

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
Yes.

115
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,680
Fine, fine. Just don't let me know that you've fallen for her.

116
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,880
No chemistry at all. I’ll believe that when I see it.

117
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,560
Do you want a splint?

118
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
What for?

119
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,880
Seems like someone’s got a broken heart.

120
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,280
You little-- Phu!

121
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,920
Normally, when you try to date someone,

122
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,280
your score should gradually build up, right?

123
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,160
but with her, it’s like I’m starting from zero every time.

124
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,760
Always shut out at the door.

125
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,320
So you're different from Tul.

126
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,760
Every time she comes back from Forensics,

127
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,680
her smile only gets brighter.

128
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,680
Come here, come here.

129
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,600
Help me think.

130
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,400
What should I do? Can you think of something?

131
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,080
How am I supposed to know?

132
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,880
I'm not close to May.

133
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,960
Didn't you say you used to flirt with a lot of women?

134
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,000
Huh?

135
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,520
That's true.

136
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,720
But your girl and my girls

137
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
are totally different.

138
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Both of you.

139
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,680
Where are we on the microchip investigation?

140
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,560
Why are you still having fun?

141
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,360
Hurry up.

142
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,960
I’ll follow up immediately!

143
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
Hello, Captain Jiu here.

144
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,520
Have you got any more information?

145
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,520
We've already identified the deceased.

146
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,520
Kuljira Lerdsakchaikul.

147
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,080
Kuljira Lerdsakchaikul...

148
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,880
Doesn't her surname sound familiar?

149
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
I remember this case.

150
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
Three years ago,

151
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,000
Kuljira drove a luxury car into a disabled man who
 was crossing the crosswalk.

152
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
But the case

153
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,400
was prolonged.

154
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,960
And she disappeared from the public eye for a while.

155
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,360
But recently,

156
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,280
she was seen at a party with some elites.

157
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,080
Why would the killer choose to kill Kuljira?

158
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840
Yeah. I'm wondering too.

159
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,520
This doesn’t match the Raindrop Killer’s usual pattern
of targeting sex workers.

160
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,080
Is it possible for the killer to change his method?

161
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,280
Phu,

162
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,880
I don't think he changed his method.

163
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,960
but the killer might have changed the way he thinks.

164
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,560
Anyway, we will have to find out the truth.

165
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,440
What are you doing?

166
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,640
This bastard didn't come home like he told us.

167
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,560
Instead, he went off to commit another crime.

168
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,840
He hired a woman

169
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,560
and then assaulted her like this.

170
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
The Kuljira's case is identical to the Raindrop Killer case
from 18 years ago.

171
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,240
The way the victim was killed,

172
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,080
the footprint at the scene,

173
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,600
and the arrangement of the corpse

174
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,840
all point to Wisut.

175
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,480
The question is,

176
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,240
Inspector Tul, why were you at the train station talking to Wisut?

177
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,680
Didn’t you hear my question!?

178
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,200
Well, I just want to ask Wisut something.

179
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,840
Ask him what?

180
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
Dansiam,

181
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,280
- Yes, sir.
- You and your team go bring Wisut in.

182
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,440
Yes, sir!

183
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,720
And you,

184
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,920
don't ever mess with this case again.

185
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,680
I'll transfer you to work on the case that Dansiam is working.

186
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,360
But Commander, sir

187
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,840
I'm not asking for your opinion.

188
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,080
This is a direct order from the chief.

189
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,920
It’s about time you learned how to work as a team!

190
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,800
Hey, Win.

191
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,120
I think you should add more ovens

192
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
to match the scale of the shop.

193
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
Also, maybe reduce the outdoor seating?

194
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,240
Thailand’s weather isn’t suited for outdoor dining
as other countries.

195
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,920
Yeah. Just do as you say.

196
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,080
Are you really listening to me?

197
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,800
You said you wanted my input on the shop.

198
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,960
Have you seen the news?

199
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,840
Um.

200
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,880
Kuljira's my mom's friend's daughter.

201
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I used to see her at parties often.

202
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,240
But after her hit-and-run scandal,

203
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,480
I never saw her again.

204
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,480
And now, the next time I hear about her, she’s dead.

205
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,040
It feels... strange.

206
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,720
Nah,

208
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,280
don't be.

209
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,680
Really,

210
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,760
I'm not that close to her.

211
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,440
But you are still the same, huh?

212
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,680
From now on,

213
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,680
don't say something if you don't really mean it.

214
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm your friend.

215
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,960
I can read you like a book.

216
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,079
Yeah, I know.

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,119
I saw the news.

218
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Is your sister working on this case?

219
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah.

220
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,560
Tin.

221
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,320
You have to tell her to be very careful.

222
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,760
This case has everyone’s attention,

223
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,240
and the killer is brutal.

224
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,440
That killer keeps  killing women non-stop.

225
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,760
I think

226
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,360
it's better to back out.

227
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,360
It’s not worth it.

228
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
But you know that

229
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,280
my sister isn’t the type

230
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,320
to give up easily.

231
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,560
Where the fuck are you trying to escape?

232
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,320
Why would you escape?

233
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,880
Serg., we have one more detainee.

234
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,040
Get inside.

235
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,960
Show you handcuff.

236
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,360
Wisut!

237
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Wisut! It's really you!

238
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
Why are you back here?

239
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,600
Or did you kill someone?

240
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,280
Fuck off!

241
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,880
Who did you kill this time?

242
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,640
You still killed the same way, right?

243
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,440
Can you tell me?

244
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,800
Stop bothering me!

245
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,480
I've been your fan since high school.

246
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
I collected every newspaper with news about you,

247
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,720
read every word.

248
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,240
It felt like you were there with me.

249
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,840
I'm not good at studying.

250
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,040
Actually, I'm not good at anything.

251
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,800
But the only thing I'm good at

252
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
is the murder details

253
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,000
of the Raindrop Killer.

254
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,200
It made me dream that

255
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
someday I'll kill people just like you did.

256
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
And I finally tried it!

257
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,520
Get lost!

258
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,640
Don't come near me.

259
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,320
I've killed someone.

260
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,440
I really killed her. It's fucking great.

261
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,080
When I beat that woman until she was unrecognizable,

262
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,160
I could smell her blood,

263
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,520
I couldn’t stop myself from thinking,

264
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,040
I need to do it again...

265
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,680
and again...

266
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,480
The sound of that woman's scream,

267
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,120
begging for her life.

268
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,760
She said don't kill me,

269
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,280
let me go, don't kill me.

270
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
You fuck!

271
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,280
What the fuck are you saying?

272
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,880
Let me go!

273
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,880
I just admire you.

274
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,040
Listen, you bastard. Don’t you dare compare your pathetic, bloodthirsty instincts to mine.

275
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,280
You and I are not the same at all.

276
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,560
Who the hell do you think you are?

277
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
You just started killing before me.

278
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,400
No matter how many people you kill,

279
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,160
you’re still trash like me.

280
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,640
You’ll rot in prison just like me.

281
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,880
The cops will crush you this time!

282
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
Mark my words, Wisut! You’re done for, scumbag!

283
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
You'll rot in prison!

284
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,760
What the hell are you talking about? What the fuck!

285
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
Say it again! You jerk!

286
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,400
You're nothing!

287
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,320
What's wrong with  both of you!

288
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,640
Stop it!

289
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,720
Come here!

290
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,640
There will be no rain for you in jail! You fuck!

291
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,280
So, you went back to killing because,

292
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,120
after getting out of prison,

293
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,160
you were just a nobody.

294
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,040
Nobody cared about you,

295
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,840
You became worthless.

296
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,080
So you had to reclaim attention

297
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,840
by killing the same way as before.

298
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,560
I didn't do it.

299
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,480
But you didn't go home just like promised.

300
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
Instead, you returned to the brothel, looking for victims.

301
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,160
18 years in jail

302
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,040
without a woman,

303
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,000
it makes a man desperate, you know.

304
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,840
My hometown is a rural place

305
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,400
with no brothels.

306
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,160
Can’t I just enjoy myself for a bit?

307
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,360
So, you admit to attacking a sex worker?

308
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,200
But it doesn't mean I kill her.

309
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,080
That Kuljira or whatever.

310
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,920
If you didn't do it,

311
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,080
then why did you try to run?

312
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,600
You want me to say it again?

313
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
What do I get this time?

314
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,640
What do you mean?

315
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,760
I need

316
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,280
two packs of cigarettes.

317
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,200
And

318
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
half a roast duck, okay?

319
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,360
Is that all you want?

320
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,960
Really?

321
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,080
Alright.

322
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,480
Who the fuck do you think you are?

323
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,360
What rights do you have?

324
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,280
Inspector, can you just

325
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,840
at least

326
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,280
bring me some soft drinks?

327
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,600
The last cops I dealt with

328
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,000
were much more accommodating than you. They gave me
whatever I wanted.

329
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,960
So do you want some fried chicken, too?

330
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,560
Go ahead.

331
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,240
Let’s show everyone

332
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,320
that cops aren’t much different from murderers.

333
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,160
I got it.

334
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,880
So, you went back to killing because after getting out of prison,

335
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,680
you were nobody.

336
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,880
Volume up.

337
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,040
Nobody cared about you.

338
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,880
so you had to reclaim attention

339
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,560
by killing the same way as before.

340
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,880
I didn't do it.

341
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,000
Do you

342
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,480
really believe he killed Kuljira?

343
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
Though his behavior is suspicious,

344
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,280
deep down I believe Wisut might be a scapegoat.

345
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,040
Not just in Kuljira's case,

346
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,880
but also the case 18 years ago.

347
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,280
You believe the rumors Tiwa spread?

348
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
It's not about Tiwa.

349
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,440
But  Dr. Run and I

350
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,840
are secretly looking for more information about the case 18 years ago.

351
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,200
There are autopsy reports of the Raindrop Killer,

352
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,280
but there are inconsistencies in those reports and old documents.

353
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,520
The weapon the killer used was just found at Wisut's house,
and it's very new.

354
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,480
His motive for killing those seven women was never clear.

355
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,920
The only connection between Wisut and the victims was that

356
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,840
he regularly drove a taxi along that route.

357
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,680
All the victims were his passengers.

358
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,840
And most importantly,

359
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,440
Wisut

360
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,480
had a relationship with the sixth victim.

361
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,160
What about the shoeprint at the crime scene?

362
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
It matches with

363
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,400
Wisut’s star-patterned sneakers.

364
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,040
That evidence is very weak.

365
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,360
Back then everyone was wearing shoes like that.

366
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,280
That's true.

367
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,800
Here are the reports I got from Dr. Rak,

368
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,440
check for anything unusual.

369
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,040
But this is just five cases. Where are the other two cases?

370
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Where are the other two cases?

371
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,920
Big Tech

372
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,760
abruptly removed Dr. Rak from the case

373
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,960
and assigned another doctor.

374
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,400
I’ve tried reaching out to the hospital for the missing reports,

375
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,320
but they haven’t responded.

376
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,480
In the first five cases,

377
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Wisut's fingerprints were not found at the crime scene.

378
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,160
But strangely, his fingerprints were found on items belonging to the victims in the last two cases.

379
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,680
Doesn’t that contradict the autopsy reports?

380
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,880
The killer’s methods became more meticulous with each case,

381
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,320
so why would he suddenly slip up and leave fingerprints in the last two cases, practically handing himself over to be caught?

382
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Now do you understand me?

383
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,520
Concluding that Wisut is the Raindrop Killer is strange.

384
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,200
I'm aiming to investigate

385
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,000
and dig up the case 18 years ago.

386
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,280
But I will do it quietly.

387
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,240
If we can solve the case 18 years ago,

388
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,960
I think we'll find the real killer in Kuljira's case.

389
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,760
Doc, if you're done with your work,

390
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,240
please tell me.

391
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,160
Let's grab some dessert. I'll pick you up.

392
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,400
- I'm heading home.
-. Are you going back home?

393
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,080
Alright. I'll close the shop myself.

394
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,920
This's the signature menu! Try it.

395
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,560
Hed!

396
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,960
You little--

397
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,120
Hed, darling

398
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,880
I have some snacks for you.

399
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,480
Oh.

400
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,880
So you're so tame now, huh?

401
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,160
Who's your real mom?

402
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,680
Me or Dr. Run?

403
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,640
That's definitely me! Whoever Hed loves

404
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,280
is her mom.

405
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,880
Inspector, how's the interrogation going with Wisut?

406
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,960
He still doesn't admit to killing Kuljira.

407
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,280
He’s as sarcastic and uncooperative as ever.

408
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,600
But...

409
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,600
there were moments where it felt like

410
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,440
he was just putting on an act.

411
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,280
We have no idea what Wisut is saying

412
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,840
which one is true.

413
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,280
But if Wisut isn't the real killer,

414
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,960
why was he willing to take the fall?

415
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,360
Maybe someone forced him not to tell the truth.

416
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,520
What if I asked you to help me?

417
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,640
Will you help me?

418
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
Are you sure you're doing this, Doc?

419
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,960
I think this might be the way to make Wisut talk.

420
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,960
Phu already came to handle the CCTV cameras in the
interrogation room for me, right?

421
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,600
Yes.

422
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,880
Thanks.

423
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,440
Dansiam

424
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,960
told you to bring it for me?

425
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,520
I can bring you

426
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,680
whatever you want to eat.

427
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,480
Just answer all of my questions.

428
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,760
Open it.

429
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,680
I prepared it especially for you.

430
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,080
What's inside?

431
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,760
Open it.

432
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,680
Funny, isn’t it?

433
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,280
The infamous "Raindrop  Killer"

434
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
is scared of just a few dead fingers.

435
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,080
I'm not afraid.

436
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,120
That's funny.

437
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,639
Inspector, you're a growm woman.

438
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,840
Why are you still playing around like a child?

439
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,960
Fine. If you’re not scared, let’s talk.

440
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,880
Mr. Wisut,

441
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,719
let me ask you one more thing.

442
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
18 years ago,

443
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,120
you only targeted sex workers.

444
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,679
Why all of a sudden

445
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,280
you change your pattern in the seventh case?

446
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,480
Why should there be a reason?

447
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,679
I do what I wanna do.

448
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,040
And the reason you cut the victim's finger,

449
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,840
is it for fun too?

450
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,840
Mr. Wisut,

451
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,640
you seem awfully coward.

452
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,840
Or in fact

453
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,360
you're not the Raindrop Killer?

454
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,440
The media’s made a big deal out of me being the killer.

455
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,560
What more do you want?

456
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Then tell me.

457
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,600
The last victim of the case 18 years ago,

458
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,960
why did you kill someone who wasn't a sex worker?

459
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,040
Why did you kill those women?

460
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,280
Because you are a misogynist.

461
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,480
You want to exercise your power over them

462
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,360
and teach them a lesson, right?

463
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,520
Answer me! Am I right?

464
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,160
You saw those women get into your car

465
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,280
and you were so desperate,

466
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,560
you couldn’t resist killing them by your own hands, could you?

467
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,480
You like it.

468
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,840
Don't hurt me.

469
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,920
You love seeing those women trapped,

470
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,360
You want to destroy their pretty faces

471
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,680
because you hate women like them so much.

472
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:09,120
You smashed them over and over until their faces
were unrecognizable.

473
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,840
You laughed in triumph

474
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,680
and then you told yourself

475
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,680
this wouldn't be your last.

476
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,320
Prostitute or not

477
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,080
how can you even tell?

478
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,360
All women

479
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
are the same.

480
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,360
And thanks for

481
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,360
flattering me by assuming

482
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,480
I only target prostitutes.

483
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,880
Don’t try to impose your moral standards on me.

484
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,240
If I want to kill,

485
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,480
I kill.

486
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,120
That’s all.

487
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
So the seventh victim,

488
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,240
you intended to kill her,

489
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,480
or you just missed?

490
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,960
Any woman standing by the roadside at night

491
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,680
is selling herself.

492
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,840
The night you committed the crime,

493
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,960
did you remember when she got into the car,

494
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,680
who that woman was talking to on the phone?

495
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,800
Baby, yes.

496
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,280
Just leaving the party now.

497
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
I'm heading home.

498
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,360
Don’t be impatient, sweetie.

499
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,480
We’ll see each other soon.

500
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,120
Hold on.

501
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Take me to any late-night cake shop you know.

502
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,840
Yeah, sweetie.

503
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,800
I'll be right back.

504
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,160
That day was not an ordinary day.

505
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,520
You killed that woman on her daughter's birthday.

506
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,920
Why did you kill her?

507
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,120
I already told the police that

508
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,320
I dropped that woman off at the cake shop.

509
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,080
But I never said that

510
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,080
she was on the phone.

511
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,280
How do you know that?

512
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,880
Because I’m the daughter, waiting for her mom to bring
her birthday cake!

513
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,360
Since my mom died at the hands of people like you,

514
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,480
I've never lived a normal life, not even for a single day.

515
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,920
If you didn’t do it,

516
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,560
why would you sit in prison for so long?

517
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,480
But if you're a real killer,

518
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,080
I'll handle this with my own hands.

519
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,800
Don't!

520
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,280
Even if I'm not a cop,

521
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,080
I can pull the trigger very accurately.

522
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,480
Within this distance, I won't miss.

523
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,360
Calm down.

524
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
You can lie to anyone, Wisut.

525
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,040
But I am

526
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,280
the one who deserves to know the truth the most.

527
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,640
It's clear. You can come out.

528
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,160
Are you okay?

529
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,680
Wanna go home? I'll give you a ride.

530
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,080
Do you believe what Wisut said earlier?

531
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,240
I was't the one who killed your mother.

532
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,240
To put it correctly,

533
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,360
I've never killed anyone.

534
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,360
I was a driver hanging around behind massage parlors.

535
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,280
That's why I met all the victims.

536
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,080
But I didn't kill them.

537
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,360
The person I'm most involved with was the sixth victim.

538
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,960
I slept with her.

539
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,520
And that led me

540
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,520
to being caught like this.

541
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,840
Hello, Jiu.

542
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,680
Contact all the relatives of the Raindrop Killer's victims,

543
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,440
especially the sixth victim.

544
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,560
Yeah.

545
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,160
Forget about that case Dansiam dumped on us..

546
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,120
Just get me in touch with them as soon as possible

547
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,680
Thanks.

548
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,720
You’ve still got it, Tech. Never miss a shot.

549
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,320
I can’t compare to you, sir.

550
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,280
Even in retirement,

551
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,760
you’re as strong as ever.

552
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,320
You haven’t aged a day!

553
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,600
Age hasn’t spared me.

554
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,360
You know, now when I walk around,

555
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,200
every step creaks like an old floorboard.

556
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,520
Getting through a full round like this already tire me out.

557
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,880
I know you like playing golf, sir,

558
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,680
so I prepared a small gift for you.

559
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,520
Oh.

560
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,720
Please take a look.

561
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,680
Whoa, whoa.

562
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,280
This looks good.

563
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,520
Thank you so much.

564
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,160
Everyone’s watching you closely these days.

565
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,880
Let me tell you something,

566
00:42:52,120 --> 00:43:00,520
to win the public’s trust, you must look squeaky clean.

567
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,920
And if there’s dirt,

568
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,080
clean it thoroughly

569
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,880
before stepping into the spotlight.

570
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,680
I hope you understand.

571
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,840
Yes.

572
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,840
Move it inside for me.

573
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,040
Any progress?

574
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,240
We’re interrogating Wisut and gathering evidence to charge him.

575
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,440
Make him confess or

576
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,920
fabricate some evidence if necessary.

577
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,520
I want him cornered.

578
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,280
That's not difficultl, sir, but

579
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,120
now Inspector Tul...

580
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,720
Inspector Tul? Why?

581
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,440
Dansiam said

582
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,640
he saw Inspector Tul lingering around Wisut's interrogation room.

583
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,760
If you want this Wisut's case wrapped up,

584
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,880
I think you need to deal with Inspector Tul first.

585
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,880
Commander, sir.

586
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,760
Do you still want to be promoted?

587
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,800
Yes, sir.

588
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,280
Well,you know that I'm always ready to do anything for the job.

589
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,280
Um,

590
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,920
then you can't miss it this time.

591
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,880
Go get it done.

592
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,760
Don't let Inspector Tul mess with Wisut's case.

593
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,160
We’ve run out of time for playing nice. Otherwise, there will be
no place left for us.

594
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,800
Here it is.

595
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,280
The house of the sixth victim.

596
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,080
I better warn you first.

597
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,400
This person

598
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,360
is super unfriendly.

599
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,440
Yeah, that's true

600
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,400
When I called him, after knowing that I'm a cop,

601
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,200
he curses at me non-stop like a rapper.

602
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,520
He can say whatever he wants. We have no choice but to put up with it.

603
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,320
Even a small lead could help.

604
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,280
Jiu, ring the bell?

605
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,520
Let's go.

606
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,040
Ow!

607
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,680
Ask whatever you want to know but make it quick.

608
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,360
Yes.

609
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,280
I’d like to know about your sister.

610
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,520
Her personality, her habits, or anything she liked to do.

611
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,080
Her personality?

612
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,480
She was a liar

613
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,680
and a thief.

614
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,880
Nearly 20 years ago, she stole almost everything from me.

615
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,320
For money, she’d do anything.

616
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,040
When your sister went to work,

617
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,800
have you ever followed her or picked her up, Mr. Arthit?

618
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,160
Are you crazy?

619
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,640
Why would I go after someone like her?

620
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,720
I cut ties with her long before she died.

621
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,080
Neighbors said you two started falling out after
your father passed away

622
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,680
and you had to divide the inheritance, is that so?

623
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,680
I remember your voice.

624
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,960
Are you the one who keep calling me?

625
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,480
If you’re here to waste my time with this nonsense,

626
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,960
get out!

627
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,160
We're just asking you for information.

628
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,160
You must’ve heard the news. A woman was recently murdered in the same way as your sister.

629
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,800
The information you provide today could be very helpful.

630
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,440
I will know if there's any link between the old case

631
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,640
and the new one.

632
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,800
I know that

633
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,800
you don't like your sister.

634
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,280
But at least think of it as helping protect others in society.

635
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,480
No matter how many times you ask,

636
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,360
I don’t have anything else to say. If you want more evidence, take it.

637
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,640
Honestly, it’d be a relief to get rid of her stuff.

638
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,000
You still keep your sister's old stuff?

639
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,760
Be careful what you touch.

640
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,040
Who knows if there are lizards or cockroaches hiding in there?

641
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,880
I’ve never touched my sister’s things;

642
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
they’re just filthy junk.

643
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,360
He’s really driving the point home, isn’t he?

644
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,000
Now everyone knows that

645
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,720
he hates his sister.

646
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,120
I think so too.

647
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,680
Look around.

648
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,680
Tul.

649
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,240
Look at this box

650
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,760
These are all from well-known brands,

651
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,360
why would your sister need to do such work?

652
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,240
Probably stealing from her customers,

653
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,080
and collecting them for sales later on.

654
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,800
Can I take this box for further investigation?

655
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,160
There might be some additional leads.

656
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,120
I already said, take it.

657
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,600
Just don’t drag me

658
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,560
into my sister’s case again.

659
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,480
I don’t want my reputation tarnished because of her.

660
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,040
Get out first.

661
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,240
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Arthit.

662
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,320
I want you to know that

663
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,400
what you did today

664
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,480
will save many more lives.

665
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,720
Does getting off work on time even exist for you?

666
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,400
What’s the standard quitting time for public servant?

667
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,600
Never heard of it.

668
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Haven't eaten anything like usual, right?

669
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,120
Are you hungry? I'll make you something.

670
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,680
Sure, make it a big meal.

671
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,840
My brain needs calories.

672
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,880
Yeah, got it.

673
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,120
Tin

674
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,680
I just got a big lead today

675
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,480
all thanks to my skills. Cool, right?

676
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,800
Felt like I was in a spy movie!

677
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,480
Enough showing off.

678
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,680
Stop talking about work.

679
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,080
Hurry up, Go take a shower

680
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,600
and come down to eat.

681
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,400
I'm hungry too.

682
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,560
Yes.

683
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,280
I just want to brag a little bit.

684
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,360
I know you're good.

685
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,760
I'll be right back.

686
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,480
Okay.

687
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,920
So, two of my cupcakes mysteriously disappeared the other day.

688
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,200
Care to explain,

689
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,200
Tul?

690
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,240
Well,

691
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,480
Police salaries aren’t that high, you know.

692
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,280
Can’t compete with bakery owners.

693
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,600
I’m not mad. Just saying,

694
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,560
I was so busy, I didn’t get to greet Dr. Run that day.

695
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,280
Invite her over again,

696
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,040
I’ve got a new cake recipe and want her to taste it.

697
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,880
The taster is here.

698
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,760
Why does it have to be Dr. Ran?

699
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,480
I just want someone else to have a taste too.

700
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
After all, you think everything taste good.

701
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,920
I'm not gonna believe it. Ugh!

702
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,720
Isn’t it good that I’m easy to please?

703
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,560
It's good but I want Dr. Run to come here often.

704
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,680
Every time she visits, my sister seems to glow with happiness—like her world’s painted pink.

705
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,560
Hm?

706
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,200
Normally you come back home, all gloomy and make a fuss with me.

707
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,240
Nah, You don't have to tease me.

708
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,680
Stop talking or I'll call Kawin.

709
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,440
What’s Kawin got to do with this?

710
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,720
You can’t let me be the only one with a “pink world.”

711
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,280
You need one too, right?

712
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,280
You're already so full of love you don't have to eat anymore, right?

713
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,680
I just ate two spoonful of it.

714
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,280
No! No more food for you!

715
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,880
Oh! Tiwa.

716
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,360
Run.

717
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,280
Have a seat.

718
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,480
What are you doing here?

719
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,080
I'm waiting for the blood test results.

720
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,840
haven’t been sleeping much lately, and I’ve been feeling dizzy,

721
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,640
so I thought I’d get a health checkup.

722
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,800
That’s good.

723
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,080
You've been stressed lately, right?

724
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,680
Yeah.

725
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,680
And..

726
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,440
what about your news program?

727
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,200
Still no sign of getting it back,

728
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,960
but I kind of expected this.

729
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,800
Oh, why?

730
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,080
It's those high-ranking police officers colluding with the media. It’s not hard to figure out I’d be targeted.

731
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,640
It’s not hard to figure out I’d be targeted.

732
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,360
So now my job is frozen.

733
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,440
Run, you should be careful too.

734
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,640
Those cops you frequently work with

735
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,280
when push comes to shove,

736
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,960
who knows when they might stab you in the back?

737
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,760
Don't worry.

738
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,680
I don't like getting involved with the police anyway.

739
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,520
Hearing that, I feel relieved.

740
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,680
When will you get you blood results?

741
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,280
I think it may take another hour.

742
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,920
Oh, why are you here?

743
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,400
Don't you have anything to do?

744
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,280
Well,

745
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,640
Miss Iced Tea.

746
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,440
Can you stop drinking it so you can stop being so icy?

747
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,480
Tiwa treated me.

748
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,000
I didn't buy it myself.

749
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,320
Whoa!

750
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,800
I feel sorry for her.

751
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,920
She's been chasing you for years,

752
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,320
yet still stuck in the sister zone.

753
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,200
But she doesn't give up.

754
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,880
Gotta respect her for that.

755
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,320
Hey, can you stop mocking her?

756
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,320
She hasn’t done anything wrong.

757
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,480
I know.

758
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,120
But I pity her.

759
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,800
Because after this,

760
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,600
you probably can't get near Tiwa often.

761
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,480
Because...

762
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,080
Ta-da.

763
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,480
The real one is racking up points!

764
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,560
Inspector Tul even brought snacks for the best friend
of the woman she’s courting.

765
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,000
Isn’t that sweet?

766
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,360
The Inspector came here?

767
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,240
You didn't see her?

768
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,720
Didn't she tell you she would come?

769
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,160
Sorry, the number you've dealed can't be connected at this time.

770
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,360
Whoa.

771
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,600
My sister returned before sunset, huh?

772
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,560
Must be a storm coming!

773
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,880
Haven't I told you already?

774
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,080
Don’t mention rain around me again.

775
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,120
Every time it rains, someone ends up dead.

776
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,000
Okay, okay.

777
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,960
I won't say it again.

778
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,440
I’m heading out to see Kawin.

779
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,720
You okay being home alone?

780
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,480
I'm fine.

781
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,480
But don’t talk about rain. I hate it.

782
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,280
Don’t want to hear it!

783
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,040
What's wrong?

784
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,920
Tul!

785
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,080
Don't worry.

786
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,960
I don't like getting involved with the police anyway.

787
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,880
Can I get some desserts?

788
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,720
What are you doing here?

789
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,120
Tin is not here?

790
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,480
No, he went out to see his friend.

791
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,760
I see.

792
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,240
Well, Doc.

793
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,600
Seriously,

794
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,360
what brings you here?

795
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Don't you have more important things to do?

796
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,760
This is my important business!

797
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,280
I bought some snacks for Hed.

798
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,160
I only picked the flavors she might like.

799
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,280
Get in to see her then.

800
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,480
Inspector.

801
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,360
Can you stop sulking like a child?

802
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,880
Honestly,

803
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,120
I didn’t just come for Hed.

804
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,320
I want to know

805
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,640
if you’re mad at me about something.

806
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,920
Didn't you say you don’t like getting involved with the cops?

807
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,920
Hey, were you eavesdropping on me talking to Tiwa?

808
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,680
I wasn't.

809
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,480
I just happened to overhear

810
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,240
while bringing you snacks.

811
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,560
I don't like cops, that's true. I'm not lying.

812
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,720
but I wasn’t including diligent

813
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,920
and capable officers like you, Inspector Tul.

814
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,320
I've never done this to anyone.

815
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,200
If you still don’t trust me, then you better do now.

816
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,920
I promise.

817
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,000
I will find out the truth about the Raindrop Killer myself.

818
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,800
I'll always stand by you.

819
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,760
I'll support you in fighting against what's not right.

820
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,280
If you don't stop,

821
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,080
you'll face something much worse.

822
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,880
Hey!

823
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,440
You think he's the Raindrop Killer?

824
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,200
I'm not sure, but we better be careful.
