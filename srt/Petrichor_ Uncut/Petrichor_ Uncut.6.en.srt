3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,040
There are multiple bruises from blunt force trauma.

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,440
But they aren’t serious enough to have killed him.

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Cause of death is strangulation.

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,840
But it can’t be confirmed yet if it’s a suicide or a murder.

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
Send this to the toxicology lab.

8
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,680
Another request form, please.

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,479
Here, Doctor.

10
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,320
Thank you.

11
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,240
Wisut died from asphyxiation.

12
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,720
But I can’t say if it’s a suicide,

13
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,720
or worse, a murder.

14
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,120
Judging from the circumstances,

15
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,880
Wisut most likely got silenced.

16
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,560
To take a life…

17
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
how dare they do this?

18
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,800
Did their positions and titles and money,

19
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,720
drive them mad enough to do

20
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,920
what they shouldn’t?

21
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,280
Doc, don't worry.

22
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,480
I will make sure that the people who killed Wisut

23
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,680
get their just desserts.

24
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Wisut's death

25
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,080
must not be in vain.

26
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
I am very sure

27
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,800
that you just got chewed out by your boss.

28
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,040
Aren’t you scared for your future as a police officer?

29
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,880
If I am,

30
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,560
I wouldn’t be here.

31
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,240
What I care about is righteousness,

32
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,200
and proving that the Raindrop Killer case from 18 years ago till now

33
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,360
isn't Wisut doing.

34
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
What do you mean?

35
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Here.

36
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,680
Are you saying that the police killed Wisut?

37
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Right now, the people don’t know yet that

38
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,240
Wisut’s dead in his cell.

39
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,560
The police will probably issue a statement,
that he committed suicide to escape.

40
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,080
So, I just wait for the moment to reveal this clip?

41
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,840
That’s correct.

42
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,760
Even though your program has been cancelled,

43
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
your own news channel

44
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,280
can still help speak for the dead.

45
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
Are you willing to take this risk with me?

46
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,240
You do know

47
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
how I feel about Run, yes?

48
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,720
I am gonna gain favors with her, you know?

49
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
And yet you are trying to help me with this news.

50
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
What are you thinking?

51
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
Let me be honest here, Miss Tiwa.

52
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
I don’t exactly wish to be on good terms with you.

53
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,040
But I can’t stand by and let all these wrongs happen again.

54
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
I understand that all this time,

55
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
police like me don’t look so great to you journalists.

56
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,320
But believe me, I am not like them.

57
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,920
This should at least help in compensating you in place of an apology,

58
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,840
and help inspire people’s hope in the police.

59
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,720
I am here to inform you all,

60
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,280
that the killer in the Raindrop Killer case,

61
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,159
and the one in Miss Kuljira’s

62
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,960
are the same person.

63
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,240
He is Wisut Saenjaisue,

64
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,640
who has committed suicide.

65
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,560
Autopsy shows that he ripped a piece of cloth from his shirt

66
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,320
to bind his neck tightly to one of the beams in his cell.

67
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:21,280
As for the reason, we believe it to be stress
from being caught by the police for his crimes.

68
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you.

69
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
Dear viewers,

70
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,640
do you truly believe that the police would let Wisut,

71
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,720
a very important person to this case, die this easily.

72
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,039
Let us watch this clip.

73
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
It’s apparent that

74
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
this is not a suicide,

75
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
but a murder committed by the police.

76
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Another important piece of evidence,

77
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,679
And another important piece of evidence is

78
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,960
is the autopsy report which indicates the presence of GHB

79
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
in the body of Wisut Sanjaisue.

80
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,880
This compound acts as a sedative,

81
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,240
but it can kill in large amounts.

82
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,360
So Wisut didn’t commit suicide,

83
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,320
and it’s a set up by the police?

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,280
In Wisut’s case,

85
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,440
he was drugged

86
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,080
and set up to appear like he hanged himself.

87
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Inspector Dansiam,

88
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,360
Inspector Dansiam,

89
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,760
the suspect in your case died by police hands.

90
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,800
What will be done next?

91
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Have the policemen responsible been arrested?

92
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,840
About that…

93
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,680
We need to investigate further.

94
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Whoa! What’s that?

95
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,840
My grandchild must not die for nothing!

96
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,880
Excuse me.

97
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
Inspector Dansiam,

98
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,360
you haven’t answered yet!

99
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,680
You told reporters about our unit’s inner workings?!

100
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,520
Whether I did or not,

101
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,320
what’s it to you?

102
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,960
This case must be investigated further anyway.

103
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,160
Only you, Tul, went to meddle in that room.

104
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm the leader of the team responsible for this case.

105
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,280
You got me in trouble by doing that!

106
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
You say that, so you admit that

107
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
the police really did kill Wisut.

108
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Ow!

109
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
Tul.

110
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
Listen to me.

111
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,760
Mistakes happen during interrogations.

112
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,680
I didn’t manage my men well,

113
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,840
that’s all!

114
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,480
You are the team leader responsible for this case,
and yet you just let Wisut die in a cell.

115
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,520
And you, you also stated that he committed suicide.

116
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
Let me ask you this,

117
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,280
aren’t you the least bit ashamed?!

118
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,480
Huh?

119
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,280
I think it’s only fitting that you are getting investigated.

120
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
We police,

121
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,360
don’t kill our juniors,

122
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,880
don’t report our superiors,

123
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,080
don’t sell out our friends.

124
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,240
By doing this you have brought trouble to everyone!

125
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,960
I stand on the side of truth.

126
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,880
Mm. So you think,

127
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,160
that you are superior to others.

128
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,880
An idealist

129
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,680
of pure heart.

130
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,080
You think that you are so different from police like me?

131
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,240
Seriously,

132
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,640
you are as rotten as the rest of us.

133
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,360
Phu.

134
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,440
Let’s go.

135
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,320
We have work to do.

136
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,760
You think just because you got a better backup than others,

137
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,640
you can do whatever you want?

138
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,760
Inspector.

139
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,200
don’t use yourself as the standard.

140
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,600
Even if you rely on that, it doesn't mean that others do the same.

141
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,520
Let me tell you this.

142
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,960
I don’t need any backup.

143
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,680
It’s pathetic.

144
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
You say that you hate relying on connections,

145
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,280
but Tul, If your father hadn’t pull strings for you,

146
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,160
you think that you would’ve climbed up this far?!

147
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,640
Oh, so you think, that if you don’t say it

148
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,680
then no one would know, that your father’s name is Tech!

149
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,720
Surname, Archawasin!

150
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,840
You think that no one will ever be suspicious of why
someone like you,

151
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,360
can climb up the ranks so quickly?

152
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,760
If not for your father.

153
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,880
Phu, let’s go.

154
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,760
Tul,

155
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,680
I don’t wanna bring this up,

156
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,480
but

157
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,120
the thing with your father is all over the group chat.

158
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,520
My phone is blowing up.

159
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
If it annoys you that much,

160
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,480
just leave the group.

161
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,280
Look, It’s not like that.

162
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,080
I meant that you are having a hard time as is.

163
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,280
This popping up will only make things worse.

164
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
And what about it?

165
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,280
The people pay taxes to employ us,

166
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,520
who my father is

167
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
has nothing to do with it.

168
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,160
Well,

169
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,840
I get how you feel.

170
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,040
If this thing stayed within our department, I wouldn’t be so worried.

171
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,400
But what about Dr. Run?

172
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
You know that

173
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,520
to her, Big Tech is a piece of shit.

174
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,480
Um. Sorry.

175
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,160
Since it’s like this, how are you gonna face her now?

176
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,400
“POLICE CONNECTIONS: BIG TECH’S ILLEGITIMATE CHILD”

177
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,560
Come in.

178
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,000
Excuse me, sir.

179
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,000
For what have you called me here today?

180
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,280
What? A father needs a reason to meet with his own child now?

181
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,040
You saw the news?

182
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
I never care about that kind of news.

183
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
That doesn’t matter. Everyone knows about it!

184
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
I am warning you here,

185
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,480
because

186
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
reporters will flock to you from now on.

187
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,560
I’m sure you know how to behave.

188
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,560
If reporters

189
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,560
or anyone ask me about it,

190
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,720
I will tell them honestly

191
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,160
that we are related by blood.

192
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,480
But in practice,

193
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
you never act like it anyway.

194
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
You really think

195
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,880
that you can just cut me out of your life?

196
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,480
You think you are so capable?

197
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,680
To come in here and reform the police,

198
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,640
even though you know nothing.

199
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,480
Things have progressed to this point,

200
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,800
only because you insist on being selfish.

201
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,400
On being a hero.

202
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
Who doesn’t care about orders

203
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,240
or teammate

204
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,880
Just because of some stupid news about Wisut.

205
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,560
Look!

206
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,680
It’s become a massive problem.

207
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,880
And how is it not right?

208
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,240
Wisut died in his cell

209
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,400
by police hands.

210
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,720
I can’t let this go.

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,960
Even if it gets riskier, I won’t back down.

212
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,240
And you should be ashamed, sir,

213
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,280
because in the case

214
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,440
that got you fame and titles

215
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,120
from 18 years ago,

216
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,440
you caught the wrong person.

217
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
Who do you think you are!

218
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,200
To spout nonsense like this.

219
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,240
Ever wonder why a young officer like you,

220
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,400
can become an inspector before the others?!

221
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,120
Don’t think that others need to do it like you did
 to get ahead quickly.

222
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,960
It’s because of bad cops like you

223
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,359
that I need to work even harder.

224
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,880
You are such a child.

225
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,720
Let me tell you this.

226
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,319
You really think that it’s your determination nonsense

227
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,839
that brought you this far?

228
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,480
Listen carefully.

229
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,920
your title as police major

230
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,119
and your position as inspector,

231
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,840
none of them are your own achievements.

232
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,480
I signed off on all of it!

233
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,040
You got what you want,

234
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,720
so be grateful for what I have done for you.

235
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,280
Stop bringing me issues and troubles!

236
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,560
You never care how I

237
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,720
and the kids are doing.

238
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,080
How tired we are.

239
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,480
Every day, you go out to receptions with your boss.

240
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,360
We are going to die out here,

241
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,160
do you even know?!

242
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,280
Shut the hell up!

243
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
You think that I am happy?!

244
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,680
Working like this?!

245
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,680
If I don’t do it,

246
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,360
how am I going to get promoted?!

247
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,520
A wife like you,

248
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,280
what do you bring other than burdens?!

249
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Hey!

250
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
Dad, don't hurt Mom.

251
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,440
If you are gonna do it, hurt me instead!

252
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,440
Stop! No!

253
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,120
From now on,

254
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,920
do whatever you want!

255
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,640
If being with you only fucks me over,

256
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,760
then I'm gonna go start a new life.

257
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,040
Don't be a burden,

258
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,680
don’t meddle in my life ever again!

259
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,360
Dad won't be with us anymore, right?

260
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,880
From now on,

261
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,480
there’ll only be the three of us.

262
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,960
I’m gonna take care of you by myself.

263
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,440
My surname’s good enough for us.

264
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
You don’t have a father from now on.

265
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,040
Mom, it doesn’t matter that dad doesn’t love us.

266
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,560
We love you.

267
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,680
We don’t need him.

268
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,360
Mom, don't cry.

269
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,680
Thank you for your help, sir.

270
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,480
But next time.

271
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,080
mind your own business.

272
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,840
I shouldn’t have seen you as my child!

273
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
Someone like you

274
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,480
only fuck over everyone!

275
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,480
Fuck over our family!

276
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,040
Fuck over the police!

277
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,640
It’s good that you won’t!

278
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
Because I never once saw you as my father.

279
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,080
If that’s all,

280
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,240
then I must excuse myself.

281
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,800
I don’t want to fuck you over any more than this.

282
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,520
Since rumors about Big Tech entering politics came out,

283
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,440
trouble seems to come for him without pause.

284
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,960
The people want Big Tech, as Assistant Commissioner General,

285
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,640
to give an explanation about Wisut’s case.

286
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,560
Apart from this,

287
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,520
there is also a rumor that Big Tech has an illegitimate child hidden away.

288
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,840
If proven true, this is a violation of government regulations,

289
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,600
that may force him to be removed from office.

290
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,840
It is also said that this illegitimate child holds a position
within the police force.

291
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,280
Reporters have contacted Big Tech’s wife for an interview,

292
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,680
but there has been no response.

293
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,000
However, Big Tech himself has something to say about this.

294
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,560
Let us move to the press conference.

295
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,440
There is nothing to hide.

296
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,640
I do have this child with my former wife,

297
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,280
but we have had no relationship for over ten years.

298
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
We didn’t register for a marriage certificate then,

299
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,200
and after that,

300
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
I met my current wife,

301
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,480
and we did sign a certificate this time.

302
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,440
I have never violated any regulations.

303
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,240
I did everything as I should.

304
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,160
I am proud of all my children.

305
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,280
If anyone wishes to smear me with fake news about my personal matters,

306
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,520
I will take legal action.

307
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,480
Run,

308
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
the inspector is here to see you.

309
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,880
Do you want her to leave?

310
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,920
I can tell her if you want.

311
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
No need.

312
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,280
It’s good that she’s here,

313
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,280
So we can end this quickly.

314
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,520
Run.

315
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,520
Run,

316
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,960
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you sooner.

317
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,640
I really didn’t have a chance.

318
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,920
I didn’t know that you would find out this way.

319
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,080
Are you sure

320
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
that you didn’t have a chance?

321
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,080
In reality,

322
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,600
the worst person here is Big Tech.

323
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,880
The others are just underlings working under his orders.

324
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,160
What is it?

325
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,560
Why are you so quiet?

326
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,800
It’s nothing.

327
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,560
You are right.

328
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,760
Not all police are good.

329
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,080
Then why do you need to be sad?

330
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,720
You aren’t on Big Tech’s side.

331
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Right?

332
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
I'm not.

333
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,880
All this time, did you have fun?

334
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,680
You know how much I hate him!

335
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Tul, don’t you forget that

336
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,240
he covered up my mother’s death!

337
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,120
I am his daughter, true.

338
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,360
But he left me and my mother when I was a child.

339
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
We have been nothing to each other since so long ago.

340
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Run, you know that I use my mother’s surname.

341
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,680
I never consider him my father.

342
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
Can we not quarrel over this?

343
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,080
I didn’t tell you the truth,

344
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,360
because I was scared that you would be angry like this.

345
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,080
I am not angry at you being his child,

346
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,280
but I can be angry as your lover, Tul.

347
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,840
You had so much time to tell me,

348
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
but you chose not to.

349
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
Run...

350
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,040
I think we should take a break,

351
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,920
I need some time to think.

352
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,680
Let’s not meet for a while.

353
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,720
Run.

354
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,880
Run

355
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,160
I’m fine.

356
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,960
Are you sure?

357
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,280
You don’t look fine.

358
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,160
I'm okay.

359
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,480
Can I have some time alone?

360
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,440
Alright,

361
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,640
but if you need anything, you tell me, okay?

362
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
Mom.

363
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,960
even the person I trust the most,

364
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,280
hurt me.

365
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,160
I don't know what to do, Mom.

366
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,560
You are in for a shock once you wake up, Jiu.

367
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,000
If you know what shitshow’s happened.

368
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,160
Inspector.

369
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,680
Hello, Dr. Rak.

370
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,880
Inspector, do you have a few moments?

371
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,520
We need to talk.

372
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,040
I must apologize.

373
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,120
Oh.

374
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,480
You don’t need to apologize to me, Inspector.

375
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,960
Yes.

376
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,160
Why would you need to, you did nothing wrong.

377
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,880
I hid the truth about my father, Big Tech.

378
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,880
Oh, and why is that strange?

379
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,520
You also don’t know who my parents are.

380
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,600
Children aren’t always like their parents.

381
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,320
You, too, aren’t the same as Big Tech.

382
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,320
I think that

383
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,560
you are the one police that stands against what is wrong.

384
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,960
I only do what is right.

385
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,920
True, and I don’t think that just about anyone can do what you do.

386
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,640
Yes.

387
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,720
I hope that you won’t disappoint me, Inspector.

388
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,440
Regarding the case, and my daughter, too.

389
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,680
I swear that I and that man have no relations anymore.

390
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,480
I am willing to do whatever it takes,

391
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,080
to reach for the truth of the past.

392
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,520
All I ask is a chance with Run, to prove my sincerity.

393
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,560
As a doctor and a person related to the case,

394
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,800
I believe in you, that you will never abandon what you believe in.

395
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,240
You are a good cop, Inspector.

396
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,320
As a father to my daughter,

397
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,200
I'm not in any place to speak or decide for her,

398
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,920
I'll just let Run think for herself.

399
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,160
I am here today only to cheer you up, Inspector.

400
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,680
Please keep it up!

401
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,040
Thank you so much.

402
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,760
Two of your men are being investigated,

403
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,840
you got lucky this time.

404
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,240
Don’t make any moves.

405
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,320
Disappear from social media.

406
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,320
Yes, sir.

407
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,680
I've closed down all communication channels.

408
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,840
You know, yes?

409
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,920
That as long as Kuljira’s actual killer isn’t caught,

410
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,840
it’s like we have a rope around our necks.

411
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,480
I do, sir.

412
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,480
I will close this case as soon as possible.

413
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,240
Dan.

414
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,760
Yes, sir.

415
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,960
About Wisut,

416
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,040
you aren’t involved with that, right?

417
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,480
I didn’t do it.

418
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,600
My men did it by accident, sir.

419
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,920
Then go and catch the actual perp.

420
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,600
This is your last chance.

421
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,040
Hey.

422
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,840
Look at how they’re glaring at you like a pack of Hyenas.

423
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,080
That's all they can do.

424
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,960
What about Jiu’s case,

425
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,680
any progress?

426
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,880
Right now I am going through the CCTV footage.

427
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
If I find anything, I will tell you right away.

428
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
You need to do it thoroughly.

429
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,280
Maybe we can glean something new from it,

430
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,280
seeing that the perp clearly meant to provoke us.

431
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,600
Ah, yeah.

432
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,280
Forensics sent us a report,

433
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,480
but there’s nothing much that can help us.

434
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,840
No hair or DNA to find a match at all.

435
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,680
We need to wait until Jiu comes to then.

436
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,800
Maybe we’ll learn something about this guy.

437
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,440
That’s the thought!

438
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,760
What?

439
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,880
Let’s go and pray,

440
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,520
I got this for you too.

441
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,480
You okay, Phu?

442
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,320
This is a bit much.

443
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,880
Ahh

444
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,880
Huh?

445
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,800
just trust me. I did so this morning.

446
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,000
I think that if it’s someone with lots of good karma like you,

447
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,280
Jiu will definitely wake up.

448
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,160
Trust me, let’s just go. Come.

449
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,920
Go.

450
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,600
Wait a sec.

451
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,720
Hello?

452
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,240
Yes.

453
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,120
Really?

454
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,240
O-Okay, I will go there right away!

455
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,520
Tul!

456
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,000
What?

457
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,760
Jiu woke up!

458
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,520
Really?

459
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,440
Wooohoooo!

460
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,480
Praise be to the holy spirits!

461
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,360
You came alone, May?

462
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,040
Yes. Run’s busy so she passed along some get-well gifts.

463
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,920
Captain Jiu’s condition is gradually getting better.

464
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,880
There’s nothing to worry about,

465
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,520
so she should be discharged tomorrow.

466
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,800
I should be going,

467
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,679
Tomorrow I’ll put in the discharge request.

468
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,880
Thank you.

469
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,800
Hey.

470
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,120
Sorry, Tul.

471
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,080
I made everyone worry.

472
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,480
Don’t mention it. It’s good that you are back, Jiu.

473
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Yep,

474
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,199
you know that many were worried for you, yeah?

475
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,280
Oy,

476
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,000
I am starving.

477
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,080
Are you?

478
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,080
Not really.

479
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,080
You go ahead.

480
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,640
Right now you gotta be hungry!

481
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
Also, we gotta go and pray.

482
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,960
For Jiu’s health, yeah?

483
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,160
What?

484
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,760
What’s up with you today, Phu?

485
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,560
You seem weird today.

486
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,080
Jiu just woke up.

487
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,720
I haven’t even asked her about the case yet.

488
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,680
Shelve that for a bit, okay?

489
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,880
I know you are super focused on it,

490
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,280
but you gotta follow me here, ‘kay?

491
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Ah, how many wheels does a tricycle have?

492
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,560
What?

493
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,280
Three. There’s a third wheel.

494
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,920
Why ask all of a sudden?

495
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,120
Let’s go. Quickly.

496
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,280
- We're going out first.
- Hey, I ask you why?!

497
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,200
Just come with me.

498
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,360
What the hell, Phu?!

499
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
I am happy for you, Captain.

500
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,080
That you woke up.

501
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,880
How could I die?

502
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,680
My bones are too hard for that.

503
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,360
And you know, May, that I am lucky.

504
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,320
Lucky? Really?

505
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,240
If that was true, then why are you hospitalized?

506
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,920
We all make mistakes, sheesh.

507
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,720
So…you’ve been with me all this time?

508
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,080
No, no.

509
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,280
Well,

510
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,440
Just before work…

511
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,920
and after.

512
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,320
That's all.

513
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,640
That's enough.

514
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,960
Actually, before I fainted,

515
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,040
I wondered

516
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
if I would ever see you again.

517
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
But this is worth it.

518
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,160
One hit

519
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,960
to learn that you still like me.

520
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,080
This is no time to joke.

521
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,640
You are so…

522
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,520
I mean, it’s true.

523
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,480
I just think that,

524
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,320
I wanted to see you again before dying.

525
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,080
May.

526
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,680
Can we get back together?

527
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,040
I only ask for one more chance.

528
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,720
If we do,

529
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
will we be sad again?

530
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,560
I will not make you sad again.

531
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,040
I promise.

532
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,560
You must keep your word?

533
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,480
I will give you only one chance, okay?

534
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,080
And don’t get hurt ever again!

535
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,280
Back when you asked me,

536
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
if you disappear,

537
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
if I would be sad?

538
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,560
I lied.

539
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,040
If you died for real,

540
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,320
I'd be really sad,

541
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,480
that I didn’t tell you.

542
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,960
That ever since we broke up,

543
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,480
you’ve always been in my heart.

544
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,160
I love you, May.

545
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,080
Don’t you think it’s rude to peek, Phu?

546
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,760
Ow!  It hurts.

547
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,720
It hurts to see them like that, right?

548
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,080
You looking for trouble? Hmm?

549
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,640
Time to leave!

550
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
I love you too, Jiu.

551
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,280
How are you?

552
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
Work must be hard,

553
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,080
losing one teammate and all.

554
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,600
Jiu’s back.

555
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,880
That so?

556
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,320
Yeah.

557
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,120
That’s great.

558
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,880
What are you doing on your phone though, work?

559
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,960
It’s not work, Tin.

560
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,640
Then why is your face like that?

561
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,680
Just…

562
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,280
Oh.

563
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,760
That’s harsh.

564
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,680
She didn’t answer at all?

565
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,960
She probably blocked me.

566
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,640
This about dad?

567
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,840
Run wouldn’t listen at all.

568
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,760
But it’s really your fault.

569
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,160
You didn’t tell her sooner.

570
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,680
It's...

571
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,440
I didn’t think about doing that at all.

572
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,080
You know as well that we’ve lived without him for so long.

573
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,880
Um.

574
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,160
That's true.

575
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,080
I can’t help you with this one.

576
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,880
Love…

577
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,520
I am

578
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,320
even worse at it than you.

579
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,680
Hed.

580
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,280
Wait a minute.

581
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,680
Be good now.

582
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,480
Hey, you think that

583
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,160
this will make her answer?

584
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,400
I don't know.

585
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,240
but I gotta try.

586
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,360
I think

587
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,480
Run probably can’t resist Hed’s cuteness.

588
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,600
Come help.

589
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Bring some bait.

590
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,520
How is she cute, huh?

591
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,120
Look at how she’s always grumpy. Go quick.

592
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,680
Alright, alright.

593
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,840
Okay.

594
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,800
Hed, lookie here.

595
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:35,960
Good job!

596
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,960
Bring it closer, Tin.

597
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
Is it good?

598
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,920
Ah! Tin!

599
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,240
She read it!

600
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,280
Just reading, yeah?

601
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,480
Not answering.

602
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,680
It’s still something. It means that she hasn’t blocked me.

603
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,640
It’d be better if you just stay home.

604
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,680
Why don’t you rest up for a few more days?

605
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,480
The Royal Thai Police, probably won’t crumble even without you here.

606
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,960
I am here to speed up the case, you know,

607
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,120
so that I can actually rest.

608
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,760
May, you go check your vacation days.

609
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,880
You’ll definitely use it up.

610
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,160
Let that be after you got back to 100%.

611
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,320
Here.

612
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,760
You made this?

613
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,760
Ever since you have known me, you ever seen me cook?

614
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,440
Eat your meals and take your meds on time,

615
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,000
understand?

616
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,160
Understood.

617
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,200
Just call me when I need to do those.

618
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,000
I can't remember.

619
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,760
Don’t be too extra.

620
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,320
I am going. Focus on your work.

621
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,800
I will take my leave now, Inspector.

622
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,480
Bye, Sarge.

623
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
How very sweet!

624
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,960
I looked away for a bit and you’ve zipped past Tul.

625
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,960
Ow.

626
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,440
So,

627
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,640
you two are dating?

628
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,880
Yep, and?

629
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,120
That’s what I thought.

630
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,680
How about you?

631
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,680
I know the thing about your father now.

632
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,480
You tried to make up with Dr. Run?

633
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,360
Yeah.

634
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,080
But it didn't work.

635
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,480
How did you do it? Tell me.

636
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,160
So I can help you plan.

637
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,280
I…I just send her Hed pics everyday.

638
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,200
What? So you sent her cat pics?

639
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,520
Yeah?

640
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,800
And how did Dr. Run answer?

641
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,040
She…read but wouldn’t answer.

642
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,480
But I think there’s been progress.

643
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,120
I thought at first that she blocked me.

644
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,360
Hm.

645
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,360
Does it not work?

646
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,720
It doesn’t!

647
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,680
When it comes to things like this, you gotta leave it to me.

648
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,880
Stop, stop.

649
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,520
Let me do it.

650
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,680
So,

651
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,880
if Dr. Run wouldn't meet or answer your chat,

652
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:34,680
what you need to do is show up where she can see.

653
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,480
Will that work?

654
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,440
Of course.

655
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,800
I took these files with me to meet May so many times.

656
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,840
If it could help me and May, then it can help you.

657
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,960
May gave in

658
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,640
only because your head got hit so hard you nearly died.

659
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,360
Or maybe, I should buy a few porridges for Run,

660
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,960
like what you did with May, right?

661
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,840
Is it a good idea?

662
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,360
So, about the files, will taking them with me work?

663
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,760
It will!

664
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,320
Come on.

665
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,520
Your hand, quickly!

666
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,640
Hurry up and go.

667
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,880
This.

668
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,880
And this.

669
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,320
That’s enough of you.

670
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,840
- Go now!
- Let’s go! Go quick!

671
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,120
Forensics will get off work soon. Go!

672
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,720
Do I need this many?

673
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,480
Just go!

674
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,240
I brought the case files. Waiting outside.

675
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,640
Understood.

676
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,480
I'm going there now.

677
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,880
Hello, Inspector.

678
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,400
I see that you brought us files.

679
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,840
What are they about?

680
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,840
Erm, I am here to hand over documents to Dr. Run.

681
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
Is she here?

682
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,880
Ah, Dr. Run is going to a crime scene.

683
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,760
Would you like to pass them along?

684
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,280
Thank you.

685
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,480
Then, I’ll take my leave.

686
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,920
What's up, Jiu?

687
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
There’s just been a murder,

688
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,480
Tul, you need to reach there before Dansiam does.

689
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,840
I need to reach there before Dansiam does?

690
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,400
What do you mean?

691
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,080
Is this related to the Raindrop Killer case?

692
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,720
That’s right!

693
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,400
The commander forbade me from doing field work.

694
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,720
so I sent Phu out to check on the situation.

695
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,520
If they take all the evidence,

696
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,800
then we won’t learn anything.

697
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,960
Got it, I’ll rush there.

698
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,840
Run.

699
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,880
Can we talk?

700
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,320
Oh!

701
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,840
Run

702
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,320
Run, wait up!

703
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,720
Run

704
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,280
Let’s talk this out, Run.

705
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,960
What is it?

706
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,560
You are going to the scene, right?

707
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,040
Jiu just called for me to go there.

708
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,560
Wanna go together?

709
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,880
That would bother you,

710
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,040
I can drive myself.

711
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,680
But we are going the same way, Run.

712
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,080
Come with me. Please.

713
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,160
I’m on my way.

714
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,560
Run! Then, let’s meet at the scene.

715
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,480
Why can’t I be more romantic, fuck!

716
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,480
Run...

717
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,600
, Don't worry.

718
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,480
I’m on the job.

719
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,320
I will inform you if there’s any update on the case.

720
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,400
But for now, please step aside.

721
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,680
Tul,

722
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,000
I checked with the people living around here.

723
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,960
They said that the first person to see the body

724
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,000
is a waste picker working nearby.

725
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,560
Okay.

726
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,280
And, I think this case’s gonna be a big one.

727
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,800
A big one?

728
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,760
The victim is the MP of this district.

729
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,000
Look over there.

730
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,040
THANK YOU TO CHUTIKARN ROJJASAB, MP.
FOR HER PART IN ALLOCATING FUNDS FOR ROAD REPAIRS

731
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,120
MP Chutikarn, huh.

732
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,880
These wounds are quite specific, caused by a cat o’ nine tails.

733
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,680
There are also burn marks from melted candle wax.

734
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,960
All marks are located under the garment,

735
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,680
which suggests that the MP is probably into BDSM.

736
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,640
She wasn’t forced into it and didn’t resist at all.

737
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Yes, I concur as well.

738
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,680
There’s a foreign body on the wound.

739
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,000
Forceps and a ziploc bag, please.

740
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,080
It's a strand of hair.

741
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,160
From looking at her,

742
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,640
the victim has straight long hair,

743
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,160
but what I found is a short strand.

744
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,080
It might belong to the person she had relations with,

745
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,960
who might be the killer.

746
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,640
Please check it for DNA.

747
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,280
Anyway, let’s begin,

748
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,320
Knife, please.

749
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,280
Let me see Dr. Run, please.

750
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,200
Dr. Run is performing an autopsy, she’s not free right now.

751
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,760
But the body’s been sent to Forensics for a while now,

752
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,480
so she should be done by this point?

753
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,800
Inspector, please go back for now.

754
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,800
Once it’s done, we will contact you.

755
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,640
If you’ll excuse me.

756
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,160
May.

757
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,160
Run passed this along.

758
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,680
Thank you.

759
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,480
May, so, is this the Raindrop Killer’s doing?

760
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,320
The wounds,

761
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,720
the rope binding, and other minute details,

762
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,920
all of them line up with the police’s hypothesis.

763
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,040
It all points to the Raindrop Killer.

764
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,280
But...

765
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,600
MP Chutikarn is not a prostitute.

766
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,960
That’s why it’s complicated.

767
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,720
Or maybe, the Raindrop Killer has changed targets?

768
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,080
That's impossible.

769
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:29,240
The method of killing may change as the killer gets more skilled,

770
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,840
but the reason behind killing can’t just be changed.
Because it indicates the complex within the killer’s heart

771
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,160
In any case, we must find out the reason,

772
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,920
how both MP Chutikarn and Kuljira

773
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,320
are related to prostitutes.

774
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,240
Big Tech, sir,

775
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,280
Wisut is already dead,

776
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,640
but the number of victims is still increasing.

777
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,920
Does this mean that Wisut was never the killer in the first place?

778
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,400
It means that someone is trying to copy Wisut.

779
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,400
Copy? In the same way as Rueangrit the copycat killer?

780
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,000
Indeed.

781
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,720
If one can copy him,

782
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,280
I don’t see why others can’t.

783
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,600
In that case, what is your plan to catch the perpetrator?

784
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,080
Because it seems like the killer won’t just stop.

785
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,880
Also, what precautions should the people take?

786
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:29,640
I ask that everyone be confident that us police
can definitely catch the perpetrator.

787
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:35,000
I declare here that I will be leading the investigation myself.

788
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,600
You want us to find another scapegoat?

789
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,680
Yes!

790
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,240
Anyone

791
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,840
that will help us end this mess.

792
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,200
But sir,

793
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,480
We can't do what we did 18 years ago.

794
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,400
that was already too much.

795
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,240
Too much?

796
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:59,920
Tell me, is your position as commander also too much?

797
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,520
You need to close this case within 3 days.

798
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,880
Because right now, the people are very interested in this case.

799
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,440
Distract their attention, no matter how.

800
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,600
I think that we should form a committee of inquiry,

801
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,120
and consider enforcing disciplinary actions on the people responsible,

802
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,560
for Wisut’s death in our custody.

803
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,040
Sir, please, hear me out.

804
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,480
Pardon me, sir.

805
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,880
No matter how much we wish to close this case,

806
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,240
there should be a limit to what we do to achieve that.

807
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,360
18 years ago,

808
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,360
we made him confess.

809
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,880
we put him in jail.

810
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,520
but now we’ve made him die in a cell, sir!

811
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,160
I will do better in managing my men, sir.

812
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,360
You shouldn’t have let them use violence in the first place!

813
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,120
Enough.

814
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,680
Wisut is dead, because of you!

815
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,680
You couldn’t control your men!

816
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,480
How dare you disobey my order.

817
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,240
If you are so independent,

818
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,280
and not ready to obey orders from a superior,

819
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,320
then I don’t think you should be on this case.

820
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,080
Let someone more capable do it.

821
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,840
Listen up.

822
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,240
From now on,

823
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,520
I will be in charge of the Raindrop Killer case myself.

824
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,680
I ask that everyone unite

825
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,840
to catch the killer.

826
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,520
Inspector Dansiam,

827
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,080
Sir.

828
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Since you are on this case already,

829
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,520
I will have you join my team.

830
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,760
Yes, sir.

831
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,440
As for others unrelated to this case,

832
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,840
I hope that no one

833
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,760
tries to meddle in this again.

834
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,320
Tul.

835
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,880
I tracked the MP back to before the she died,

836
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,680
and found that MP Chutikarn met with Arthit last week.

837
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,000
Arthit?

838
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,040
The relative of the sixth victim,

839
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,520
the one I took his sister’s things from?

840
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,720
But from the pic, it looks like they just met for work.

841
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,360
What a coincidence, that Arthit is also related to the Raindrop Killer case.

842
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,720
There’s no such thing as coincidence.

843
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,080
Nothing seems off so far.

844
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,480
Phu.

845
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,960
Any progress?

846
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,720
Wait a moment.

847
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,880
I found this.

848
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,880
Arthit once got reported for domestic violence,

849
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,880
and the victims were his sister and his wife.

850
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,720
But, the things that might link him to the MP’s case…

851
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,280
there’s nothing.

852
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:46,880
Um,

853
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,080
Wait, what you said about him hurting his sister,

854
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,080
was she the sixth victim of the case from 18 years ago?

855
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,960
Uh…yes, same person.

856
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,720
Also, back then, even though he just started working,

857
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,320
he had already resorted to violence.

858
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,120
He hurt his sister, well, it’s all about the money.

859
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,040
Phu,

860
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,440
show us the pic of Jiu’s assailant.

861
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,120
Where’s that bitch?!

862
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,800
Inside, sir.

863
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,120
If we judge from just the picture,

864
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,080
his profile seems to match up with Arthit pretty well.

865
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,840
Bring me to her, quick!

866
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,280
Yes, sir!

867
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,840
But we still can’t confirm,

868
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,280
if Arthit is really the killer we are looking for.

869
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,960
Should we just go meet Arthit?

870
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,840
If he really is the one who hit me,

871
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,160
no way we can just let him walk.

872
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,760
Hey, Jiu, calm down!

873
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,160
Whoa.

874
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,440
We can’t just go and arrest him.

875
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,840
The Commander really won’t like that.

876
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,240
This guy might not even come in for questioning.

877
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,880
Wait, Phu.

878
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,560
You said that Arthit

879
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,720
likes to drink and use violence?

880
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,840
Yes.

881
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,480
I don’t think he can just stop being like that.

882
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,480
Um,

883
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,720
So, an unrelated charge?

884
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,680
Yep. If we can take him in for using violence,

885
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,080
we might find out something related to the Raindrop Killer.

886
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,240
Put out a warrant in the meantime.

887
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,760
Understood.

888
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,520
I’ll look into this.

889
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,640
Let’s go, Phu.

890
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,800
Doctor?

891
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,760
You came here yourself?

892
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,280
Yes. Here’s the lab result.

893
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,040
Oh, yeah.

894
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,880
But normally just sending an email would suffice, no?

895
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,920
I thought that I’d have to explain the result to you, Inspector.

896
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,080
it’s probably an important part of the case.

897
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,280
So,

898
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,080
MP Chutikarn most likely had a penchant for BDSM.

899
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,480
Wait,

900
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,080
what does this mean?

901
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,040
The MP’s a masochist?

902
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,080
It seems so. The lab result tells as much.

903
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,560
Oy, Chut!

904
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,280
Sir!

905
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,680
The MP’s other phone, the one under the car seat.

906
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,080
What have we found?

907
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,760
From what I’ve looked into,

908
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,680
there’re only hookup apps on it.

909
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,040
I am now checking for anything off.

910
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,280
In the phone itself,

911
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,200
it’s full of photos of that kind, like the doctor said.

912
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:22,960
Send them to me.

913
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,680
I’ll send them right away.

914
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,080
Oh, Kawin!

915
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,320
Hello!

916
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,280
Wait, is that Tul?

917
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,160
You got so much prettier!

918
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,280
Err, I’ll take my leave now.

919
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,720
The picture matches the conclusion from Forensics,

920
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,120
on her liking of BDSM.

921
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,720
Okay then.

922
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,600
Thank you very much.

923
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,280
You're welcome.

924
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,080
Are you coming back to the hospital?

925
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,880
Not yet. Something urgent just came in.

926
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,440
What thing?

927
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,080
Wait, is this related to you rushing the files to the bureau today?

928
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,480
Kinda. It’s…

929
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,400
I just found out that

930
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,400
Kawin is related to the dead MP Chutikarn.

931
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,120
Kawin?

932
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,440
That Kavin? The rich guy?

933
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,680
Yeah. He’s friends with Tul’s brother.

934
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,080
I just learned that

935
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,560
he has violent tendencies,

936
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,040
enough to be on international news

937
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,640
So that’s why you think he’s the perp?

938
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,480
It’s possible. Right, May?

939
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,520
Run, don’t be like this.

940
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,120
If we only wait for the police to move,

941
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,840
it’ll probably be too late.

942
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,960
But it’s dangerous!

943
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,880
You're already overstepping your duties as an doctor!

944
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,720
But it’s not beyond my duty as the child of the victim, May.

945
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,240
I’ll send the info to you later.

946
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,880
Well, where are you going to meet him?

947
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:17,240
Run

948
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,920
Run!

949
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,319
If you have something to tell us, please do so.

950
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,680
The police really do want to help you.

951
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,880
Don’t you wish to be free from this suffering?

952
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,840
I can really help you.

953
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,479
Alright.

954
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,880
Arthit, he’s short-tempered.

955
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:12,120
Come here, bitch!

956
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,960
You’re asking for it,

957
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,000
aren’t you!

958
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,160
I told you nicely so many times,

959
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,359
Why the fuck didn’t you listen!? Huh?

960
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:22,040
I told you so many fucking times,

961
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,279
Stop crying!

962
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:32,800
Come here, come! You wanna fuck with me, huh!?

963
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,240
Damn you! Don’t you dare talk back again!

964
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,439
I won’t let up next time.

965
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,880
I don't want to stay with him anymore.

966
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,880
I want to press charges for his assault.

967
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,480
In that case, I’ll need more details.

968
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,360
How is it, Phu?

969
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,760
Arthit’s wife is finally pressing assault charges.

970
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,800
Now Jiu’s collecting info

971
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,200
so we can issue a warrant.

972
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:45,960
Good.

973
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,640
Come back once you’re finished.

974
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,440
I am waiting outside his shop.

975
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,520
Your face pisses me off,

976
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,320
you know that?!

977
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,000
Is your salary not enough?

978
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,120
That’s why you had to fuck my guest?!

979
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,520
Sir! That was the first time!

980
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,480
Please don’t fire me!

981
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,880
I'm sorry.

982
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,000
My place sells booze, not whores!

983
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,480
Don’t ever show your face around here again!

984
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:27,960
Get the fuck out!

985
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,880
You too.

986
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,480
Get your ass inside!

987
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,080
I’m fucking sick of your face.

988
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,160
Yeah.

989
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,160
it’s a shitshow.

990
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,080
Ah. Later.

991
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,280
Stop.

992
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:24,880
Move, and I shoot.

993
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,320
You really think you can run? Huh?

994
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,440
Your wife just reported you for use of violence.

995
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,120
For just a charge like that, you really need to do this much?

996
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,640
A violence case

997
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,120
is one thing,

998
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,680
but right now, you are a suspect in another case, Mr. Arthit.

999
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:21,960
Tin!

1000
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,280
Stop involving yourself in this case,

1001
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,600
Or prepare to say goodbye to your career.

1002
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,080
Noted.

1003
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,880
Thank you for your warning, sir.

1004
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,680
Run!

1005
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,320
Captain!

1006
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,480
What happened?

1007
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,760
Your son and Dr. Run got kidnapped at the house by his friend Kawin.

1008
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:34,960
No!!
