00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,500
What is it?

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,810
What happened that you suddenly want to see me?

3
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,440
You're the only one I can talk to.

4
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,830
So, something did happen.

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,750
Is he terminally ill or something?

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,780
He was lying when he said he was sick.

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,880
Is he crazy?

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,490
Why would he tell such a lie?

9
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,840
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,750
I can see why you cut ties with him.

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,400
You get absorbed too easily.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,410
How can you laugh?

13
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,310
You didn't laugh it off in front of him, did you?

14
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,920
I wish I did.

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,010
This must be some kind of illness, too.

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,180
Because we're friends, he jokes around,

17
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,500
treats me nicely,

18
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,730
and he's by my side.

19
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,340
But I get seriously angry

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,200
and get hopes up. I feel stupid.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,630
What?

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,420
When you suggested creating a webtoon,

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,040
I should've said no, no matter what.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,470
I came out late at night.

25
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,730
This is what you're telling me?

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,970
I've never said this to anyone.

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,090
But I keep doing it because you side with me.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,130
Is there really an end?

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,110
I don't know what's going on anymore.

30
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,430
Were you cursed to be in unrequited love forever?

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,930
You want me to help you?

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,410
First of all...

33
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,700
What?

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,320
What's the deal?

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,140
It's nothing.

36

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,460

39

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
Yes.

45
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,210
I'll be at the studio, and you'll stay here.

46

can you follow him around and call all the time?

178
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,900
Does he find me annoying?

179
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,680
- You don't even know.
- Don't act like you know. I'll beat you up.

180
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,790
Ba Woo and I've been friends since kindergarten.

181
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,800
We've been friends all the way through college.

182
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,140
He never had a friend like me his whole life.

183
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,210

186
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,730
I told him to do that.

187

You stop bothering him.

188
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,010
<i>Why did you quit music?</i>

189
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,650
<i>Because it was unrequited love.</i>

190
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,170
<i>He never had a friend like me his whole life.</i>

191
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,560

Are you okay?

202
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,730
Maybe I shouldn't have told him that.

203
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,610
It's okay.

204
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,010
I can finally move on now.

205
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,260
I can't study today.

206
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,760

I've only played it for you.

What do you think?

214
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,280
Is it not good?

215

I practiced a lot, but I'm not getting better.

I like it.

217
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,910
Just say I'm not good.

218
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,590
Don't try to comfort me.

219

I really like it.

220
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,500
I say I like it because I do.

221
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,450
Is there another meaning to that?

222
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,090
