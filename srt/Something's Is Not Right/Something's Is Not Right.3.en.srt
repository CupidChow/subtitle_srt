Join me, please.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,060
Can't you just join me?

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,230
I wasn't planning to beg you like this.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,870
Join me, please.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,380
I said I won't.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,360
I only have time for my studies and work.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,400
Would you like to do it as work, then?

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,430
You said you only have time
for your studies and work.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,020
It's better than working at a cafe.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,460
Think of me as a job and help me out.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,630
I'll make sure to pay you by the hour.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,610
It's not so hard to do.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,220
You'd like to finish your story, too.

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,550
I guarantee it won't be a bad deal.

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,860
Let's do it, please?

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,600
You will, right?

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,870
How much will you pay me?

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,890
Ba Woo.

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,320
Gosh, let's talk later.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,450
I have a class.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,480
Let's go together.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,120
I'll follow you until you say yes.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,090
What are you, a stalker?

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,950
Stalker?

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,480
[It's Okay If You Don't Mean It]

27
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,020
What if we win the grand prize?

28
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
Please leave.

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,650
I thought you'd leave if I said yes.

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,390
The contract period starts now. I'm not leaving.

31
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,400
Give me your notebook, at least.

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,190
From now on, let's-

33
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,780
Ba Woo.

34
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,010
Why did you come alone?

35
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,490
I said we should go together.

36
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,400
- What are you-
- I missed you while we've been apart.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,290
- Are you crazy-
- Come on.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,640
It must've been hard.

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,940
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,070
I was so clueless.

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,920
Ba Woo was talking to me.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,320
Do you know me?

43
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,690
That's enough.

44
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,960
We're at the library. Please.

45
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,330
<i>Stalker bastard.</i>

46
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,340
<i>He looks normal, though.</i>

[Stay away from Ba Woo, please]

48
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,840
[Who do you think you are?]

49
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,350
Hey, come on.

50
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,040
Ba Woo, hold on.

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
Hey, let's go on a date right now.

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,930
A date? W-What are you doing?

53
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,220
We go on a date all the time, Ba Woo.

54
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,270
A date.

55
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,080
What do you think I'm doing?

56
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,420
Why would you ask me that?

57
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,090
Who's that bastard?

58
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,810
Ba Woo,

59
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,100
how long have we been together?

60
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,910
It's what we do all the time.

61
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,940
Going on a date.

62
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,350
What's the big deal, right?

63
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,060
What are you saying?

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
I'll call you after the class.

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,450
Answer your phone.

66
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,790
Stop being picky.

67
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,160
Eat stuff like this, too.

68
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,260
It's good for you.

69
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,680
I-It's not tasty.

70
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,350
It must've been difficult for you.

71
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,870
Thinking about it, it was partially my fault.

72
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,490
Since I've always cared for you,

73
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,210
you can't bring yourself to say no.

74
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,440
You can't refuse.

75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,860
That's why you're in this strange situation.

76
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,500
Strange situation?

77
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,830
I couldn't help but find it strange.

78
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,410
I treat you so nicely,

79
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,180
but why did you suddenly want to cut ties?

80
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,360
And you suddenly asked me out later.

81
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,590
Just eat this.

82
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,520
Anyway,

83
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,780
I understand the situation now.

84
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,140
I'll be generous and let it slide this time.

85
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,260
What should we do after this?

86
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,250
I'll figure it out.

87
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,230
And you figure it out yourself.

88
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,060
<i>- He said yes because...</i>
<i>- I have an idea for the story.</i>

89
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,250
<i>- Call me right now.</i>
<i>- You must be dying to know.</i>

90
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,350
<i>Aren't you curious what would happen to them?</i>

91
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,460
We were supposed to go on a date.

92
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,870
Hey, let's go on a date.

93
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,020
I made plans A, B, C, and D.

94
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,890
Shouldn't you get me to agree first?

95
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,090
I have to study.

96
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,010
You can study anytime.

97
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,030
You can't go on a date with me a week later.

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,010
I canceled the practice to hang out with you.

99
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,020
If you don't go on a date with me,

100
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,570
I'll get yelled at by my bandmates

101
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,250
and I'll have to eat alone

102
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,310
feeling lonely.

103
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,660
I'll be walking alone on this big campus, too.

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,140
But I'm really okay.

105
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,330
I'll be fine.

106
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,370
Right?

107
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,700
<i>Aren't you curious what would happen to them?</i>

108
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,290
Look, look. The band members always play basketball.

109
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,200
That's why they don't improve.

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,130
Try playing it.

111
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,570
I forgot how to.

112
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,590
What are you, a goldfish?

113
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,780
How could you forget that?

114
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,080
Try playing. Let me see how good you are.

115
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,430
I spent all of my brain cells studying in 12th grade.

116
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,090
Is that possible?

117
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,790
Is that true?

118
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,830
I can just teach you, then.

119
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,120

120
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,580

123
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,360
very secretive toward me. Did you know?

124
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,890
Be honest with me.

125

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,210
Someone who never has time for me.

185

What are you saying?

186
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,230
Here's the last event I prepared.

187

190

<i>You answered immediately.</i>

191
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,780
I answered, not realizing it was you.

192
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,580
I forgive you because you're funny.

193
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,950
I'm your employer.

194
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,520
Why do I have to beg you?

195
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,210
<i>You haven't sent the payment yet.</i>

196
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,170
<i>What is it about now?</i>

197
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,080
I can't bring myself to understand.

198
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,440
He's been doing nothing.

199
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,830
Why does he suddenly want to cut ties?

200
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,290
Can't they just stay friends?

201
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,950
Being friends is enough.

202
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,910
He can enjoy it without asking too much.

203
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,060
As long as he doesn't reveal his feelings,

204
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,490
it won't be a problem.

205
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,830

206
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,230
What?

207
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,300
<i>It's not sudden.</i>

208
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,520
The moment he realized something was wrong,

209
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,460
he wanted to end it.

210
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,920
It wasn't my fault this time.

211
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,180
Why keep talking about whose fault it is?

212
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,580
But I did nothing wrong-

213
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,760
Try to pass instead, at least.

214
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,750
You didn't rebound, either.

215
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,070
I shoot and rebound, too. What do you do?

216
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,660
Are you just a wall?

217
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,650
I scored all the goals.

225
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,820

Why do you keep this on your hair?

231
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,600
What a dummy.

232
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,730

233
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,680
<i>He smiles and cares about me.</i>

234
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,610
<i>Maybe he likes me, too.</i>

235
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,590
