What did you say?

2
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,340
Just for a week.

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,690
Don't ask me why, and just answer me.

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,340
Do Ba Woo.

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,350
I liked you from the moment I saw you.

6
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,170
Would you like to...

7
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,280
go out with me?

8
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,330
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,050
I don't want to date anyone right now.

10
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,260
I find it to be a burden.

11
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,460
It's 4:3.

12
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,100
- I'll finish it up.
- No way.

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,560
When will you get five points?

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,600
I'll score quickly.

15
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,510
I learned everything as a kid

16
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,680
except for allowing penetration.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,300

18
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,230
What the heck!

19
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,230
Come on!

20
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,790
Hey.

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,780
Do Ba Woo, you're popular.

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,920
It's because I'm handsome.

23
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,840
You're so shameless.

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,750
Am I ugly because no one asked me out?

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,110
You can say that.

26
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,960
It's so annoying.

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,960
I want to get popular like you.

28
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,750
By the way,

29
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,730
why didn't you say yes?

30
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,170
I just don't want to date anyone now.

31
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,770
Not yet?

32
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,530
How about you? Do you want to?

I have you.

I prefer hanging out with you for now.

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,040
Be honest.

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,790
You have the most fun with me, right?

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,470
Not really.

39
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,360
Not that much.

40
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,690
You hurt my feelings.

41
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,420
Can't you say you like being with me just once?

42
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,550
What did you say?

43
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,400
You asked me out.

44
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,490
Okay, fine.

Of course, he never answers at once.

You've got to be kidding me.

67
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,770
He just messaged. Why can't he answer my call?

<i>You always make me call twice.</i>

69

But he wants us to date for a week.

160

161
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,600

He got sick of you and wanted to cut ties with you,

170
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,560
but you're too slow to understand it.

171

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,480
I'm not interested.

187
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,920
Why not?

188
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,440
I'm very interested in you.

189
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,760
Stop being interested.

190
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,420
I keep thinking about it,

191
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,690
but there isn't a story I like more than yours.

192
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,310
Let's work together.

193
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,110
You were going to finish the story, anyway.

194
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,330
I won't write it anymore. I hit writer's block.

195
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,120
Geez, if so...

196
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,340
I'll help you come up with ideas.

197
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,850
I'm sure I could help.

198
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Since we both started, we should see the end. Okay?

199
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,090
Help, my foot.

200
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,420
I confessed after listening to you

201
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,610
and now I'm screwed.

202
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,260
Did you use...

203
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,820
the confession attack?

204
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,670
Really?

205
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,310
Everything's messed up now.

206
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,100
Messed up?

207
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,100
What I told you to say would've been perfect.

208
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,830
Why did it get messed up?

209
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,670
Instead of rejecting me and making things awkward,

210
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,110
what if he said yes?

211
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,640
What am I supposed to do next?

212
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,580
Whoa.

213
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,750
That's so creative.

214
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,650
I knew it'd be a refreshing turn of events.

215
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,290
I love it.

216
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,770
Forget it. I give up.

217
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,770
It turns out he liked you, too.

218
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,000
It's a happy ending both ways. I like it.

219
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,450
Didn't you read it carefully?

220
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,730
Asking him out didn't work, either.

221
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,670
That slow bastard...

222
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,380
doesn't take anything seriously.

223
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,510
That does suit his character.

224
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,910
It's not fun if it's too easy.

225
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,740
Wow. I like that character.

226
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,920
I like it more and more.

227
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,720
Anyway,

228
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,180
work with me if you'll keep writing that. Okay?

229
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,560
I have no idea how to end it.

230
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,090
I'm really giving up this time.

231
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,570
It means he didn't dislike it, either.

232
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,130
Maybe it's something like this.

233
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,400
He never dated before, right?

234
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,180
How did you know?

235
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,220
I know my kind well.

236
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,870
He learned how to date on the internet

237
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,080
and he wants to practice with you.

238
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,330
- With me?
- With him?

239
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,360
Yes.

240
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,470
People do all sorts of things when they're desperate.

241
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,240
[Using him for practice? / Me?]

242
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,480
No.

243
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,750
Ba Woo isn't interested in dating.

244
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,400
How do you know, you bastard?

245
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,270
Of course, I know.

246
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,240
I know everything about Do Ba Woo.

247
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,930
You're not him. How do you know everything?

248
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,410
You're asking us because you don't know.

249
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,580
- Right.
- Right.

250
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,740
Whatever. I know I'm right.

251
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,890
Dating fixes everything.

252
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,750
How about a group blind date?

253
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,770
That's what you wanted to bring up.

254
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,350
How about the five of us,

255
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,050
including Ba Woo, go on a group date?

256
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,410
<i>Deal!</i>

257
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,450
Ji Hoon, let's go on a group blind date for Ba Woo.

258
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,900
Okay?

259
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,060
[Ba Woo on a group blind date?]
Okay, okay?

260
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,890
<i>It means he didn't dislike it, either.</i>

261
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,340
He might not take it seriously,

262
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,740
but wouldn't most people say no?

263
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,680
I don't know what you think as a writer,

264
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,610
but that's the only explanation for me.

265
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,320
Doesn't that mean...

266
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,630
he likes you?

267
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,240
What are you doing, Do Ba Woo?

268
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,900
Do Ba Woo.

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,950
Yes, yes.

272
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,590
Okay.

273
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,820
<i>Did you suggest the group date to Ba Woo?</i>

274
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,800
Huh?

275
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
<i>There's no time.</i>

276
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,080
<i>Do it for Ba Woo, okay?</i>

277
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,020
O-Okay.

278
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,300
Was that about me?

279
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,330
What do you mean?

280
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,910
Seriously, you're so quick.

281
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,010
I'll go wash my hands.

Yes.

A music academy?

288
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,400
<i>Yes, you asked about our classes.</i>

289
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,700
<i>Isn't this Mr. Do Ba Woo's phone?</i>

290
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,670
Yes, but he's away at the moment.

291
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,330
But did you say a music academy?

292

Oh, I see.

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,570
Okay, I'll tell him you called.

Geez, this really is a stalker.

300

He called so many times.

You talk as if we've never fought.

Not like that.

306
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,000
A fight where we swear we'd never be friends again.

307
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,650
It's hard to imagine it.

308
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,430
What do you mean?

309
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,880
How we'd never see each other

310
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,050
or talk to each other.

311
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,180
We'd no longer care how each other is doing.

Hey, only you think I'm clueless.

You're incredibly clueless, Ji Hoon.

00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,490
Only you tell me that.

You're gaslighting me, aren't you?

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,610
I guarantee this.

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,750
If we cut ties, that'd be 100% your fault.

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,620
we'd actually cut ties eventually.

Yes. But...

I'll just ask him directly.

<i>I've been thinking about you all day.</i>

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,060
No, no. I've already said that a hundred times.

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,710
I already made up my mind.

353

00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,870

[Something's Not Right]

369
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,830
♫ <i>My feelings I wasn't aware of blossomed out of darkness</i> ♫

370
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:45,000
♫ <i>In your eyes that stole my heart</i> ♫

371
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:51,240
♫ <i>The buried memories that left me without realizing</i> ♫

372
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:58,750
♫ <i>I noticed myself looking for them inside of me</i> ♫

373
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,170
♫ <i>I've been looking everywhere</i> ♫

374
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,010
♫ <i>And I just discovered you</i> ♫

375
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,420
♫ <i>I want, I want, I want</i> ♫

376
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,850
♫ <i>I want you as a whole</i> ♫

377
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,990
♫ <i>What's happening in my head right now</i> ♫

378
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,210
♫ <i>It could be considered too much</i> ♫
