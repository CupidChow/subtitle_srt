191
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,510
- Pass it to me.
- Huh?

192
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,470
It's Do Ba Woo.

193
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,730
Ba Woo, I heard you confessed love to Ji Hoon.

194
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,320
Look how serious he looks.

195
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,240
Come on. Geez.

196
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,950
I knew it.

197
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,320
Liar Ji Hoon.

198
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,070
Ba Woo is angry because you lied.

199
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,960
Come on. That's his default face, okay?

200
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,590
And when did I say he confessed his love?

201
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,760
He just said he likes me.

202
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,980
Isn't that the same thing?

203
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,500
That's not the face of someone in love.

204
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,430
Did you dream about it after Ba Woo yelled at you?

205
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,790
Hey.

206
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,580
Ba Woo, you said you like me, right?

207
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,850
Much more than those losers.

208
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,560
Right?

209
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,600
He meant you.

210

You can't just leave like that.

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,830
What?

251
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,770
I'm looking for a story writer for my webtoon.

252
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,240
I like the novel you wrote.

253
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,410

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,190

Or a poem?

256
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,800
Anyway, the contest theme is unrequited love.

It's Do Ba Woo.

I've never seen him before.

265
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,250
It's probably a friend.

266
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,870
Ba Woo can't have a friend I don't know of.

267

- It's impossible.
- Stop. You're creeping me out.

Gosh, he's so unbelievably obsessed.

291
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,930
You can still write about it without being in one.

292
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,480
I suppose.

293
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,900
You don't need to be in love to write a love story.

294

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,560
It's not the same old story, right?

297

He was rejected as a friend, but he doesn't get it.

299
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,930
He subtly looks down on the person. How infuriating.

300
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,890
If it were me, I'd-

301
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,270
just confess my love.

302
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,090
Just ask him out.

303
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,100
Haven't you heard of a confession attack?

304
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,630
I guess he could've thought

305
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,930
it was liking him in a friendly way.

306
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,240
No matter how clueless he is,

307
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,870
he'd know what it means to go out with someone.

308
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,620
The moment he's asked out,

309

unrequited love or friendship

310
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,210

It's so realistic and impactful.

312
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,630
Is he out of his mind?

313
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,480
What do you think?

314
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,130
How about asking him out just for a week?

315
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,650
- A week?
- So that he could be totally confused.

Are you having fun?

322
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,150
Think about it. He'd hear the confession

323
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,750
and think, "Is he crazy? Is he joking?"

324
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,310

325

"I was joking. Why take it so seriously?"

326
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,340
And then smile.

Happy now?

366
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,760
Go Ba Woo, you're funny.

367
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,210
I caught you lying immediately.

368
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,100
Why did you say stop being friends?

369
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,710
You couldn't resist playing basketball together.

370
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,320
Hey,

371
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,780
what are you, a child?

372
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,340
You're all talk when you don't mean it.

373
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,420
Geez...

374
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,490
Go out with me.

375
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,080
What did you say?

376
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,130
Just for a week.

377
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,500
Don't ask me why, and just answer me.

378
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,070
What did you say?

379
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,180
I was joking. Did you take it seriously?

380
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,250
Geez Louise.

381
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,030
You scared me.

382
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,480
<i>Okay.</i>

383
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,810
What?

384
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,250
Okay.

385
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,710
<i>Sometimes you suddenly realize something's wrong.</i>

386
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,950
[Something's Not Right]

387
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:33,170
♫ <i>My feelings I wasn't aware of blossomed out of darkness</i> ♫

388
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:39,480
♫ <i>In your eyes that stole my heart</i> ♫

389
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,770
♫ <i>The buried memories that left me without realizing</i> ♫

390
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:53,250
♫ <i>I noticed myself looking for them inside of me</i> ♫

391
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,660
♫ <i>I've been looking everywhere</i> ♫

392
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,480
♫ <i>And I just discovered you</i> ♫

393
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,860
♫ <i>I want, I want, I want</i> ♫

394
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,170
♫ <i>I want you as a whole</i> ♫

395
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,580
♫ <i>A story that came together in my head</i> ♫
