00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>Nestled amid the mighty river and mountains
East Chuncheon High, class 2-3.</i>

2
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,950
CHUN CHEON, 2002

3
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,450
<i>I'm Gu Jin-Woo.</i>

4
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,670
Good morning.

5
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,230
- Grab some.
- Thanks.

6
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,140
Hey you. There you go.

7
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,080
<i>That summer.</i>

8
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,850
<i>Korea achieved a World Cup miracle,</i>

9
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,810
Hey Sonny, watch out!

10
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,520
<i>But there's no soccer team nor
a World Cup stadium in the area.</i>

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,020
Sonny, don't forget your textbook!

12
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,610
<i>Still, many kids dreamed of
becoming a soccer player.</i>

13
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,650
CONQUERING THE DREAM OF
ENTERING SEOUL UNIVERSITY

14
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,870
ΤΟ ΤΟ ΤΟΤΟ, TOAST, TOAST
YEAH YEAH

15
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,330
Here you go.

16
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,810
Thank you. Wow.

17
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,040
<i>This is Dong-Hyun.</i>

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,080
<i>He eats all day,
even eats in his dreams.</i>

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,250
What the...

20
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,590
Thanks Auntie

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,720
- I'm gonna kick your ass for real.
<i>- And that's Byeong-Ju.</i>

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,260
<i>This guy sleeps all day.</i>

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,020
<i>Must be full of dreams.</i>

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,390
<i>One's Life follows one's name.</i>

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,130
<i>That's why he's called...</i>

26
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,270
Tae-Tanic.

27
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,580
What did you dream about?

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,350
It's straight up, again.

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,410
Please, don't pull so hard.

30
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,470
<i>Nike and school uniforms
just clicked back then.</i>

31
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,760
Too many white Air Forces.

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,240
Red is the real deal.

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,500
They don't sell red ones in Korea.

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,020
Is that guy some foreigner then?

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,480
What?

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,830
<i>Introducing Mr. smug face.</i>

37
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,270
Never seen before?

38
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,040
No, how did you get them?

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,790
They're so cool.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,890
<i>His name is An Sung-Bin,
transferred from Seoul last year.</i>

41
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,250
Seoul never disappoints.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,960
<i>Face reading is...</i>

43
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,670
Losers.

44
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,670
<i>...no joke.</i>

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Stamp on them!

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,210
Crush them.

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,850
It hurts.

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,170
Get it done.

49
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,730
Stop it!

50
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,270
<i>They are different in every way,</i>

51
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,810
<i>but they share one thing in common.</i>

52
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,150
What the hell, this is our classroom.

53
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,260
Ours!

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,240
Yo, stop it. I'm about to poop.

55
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,910
<i>They all have a crush on Sun-Ah,
the class president.</i>

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,370
Why so into her?

57
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,700
She's pretty.

58
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,180
She seems no fun.

59
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,880
Still pretty.

60
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,450
Sun-Ah, big news.

61
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,700
Did you hear Ji Sung Park is
heading to Europe next year?

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,260
He's going abroad?

63
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,080
- Good for him.
- Right?

64
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,730
Which class is he?

65
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,150
Let me ask around.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,710
Guys, which class is Ji-Sung?

67
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,460
She's such a know-it-all.

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,730
Still pretty.

69
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,750
For me, it's a bit different.

70
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,000
Right?

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,180
She is...

72
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,120
sexy.

73
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,890
Live a life.

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,830
Alright fine!

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Get him!

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,860
YOU ARE THE APPLE OF MY EYE

77
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,140
Attention!

78
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,220
Dismissed.

79
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,950
<i>At 18, we were most driven
by the three human needs.</i>

80
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,470
<i>The need to eat.</i>

81
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,930
<i>To sleep.</i>

82
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,810
<i>To be pleasured.</i>

83
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,480
<i>And there's a fourth.</i>

84
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,940
<i>To aim and hit.</i>

85
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,060
Pass it to me.

86
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,070
Silence.

87
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,110
I can still see you.

88
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,120
Stop it!

89
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,370
I said silence.

90
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,750
You Are Done!

91
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
<i>She... as well?</i>

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,430
Anyone guilty stand up now.

93
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,470
I said get up.

94
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,630
You too Tae-Wan.

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,570
Tae-Wan.

96
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,110
Yes?

97
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,530
You hiding something?

98
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,090
Nothing at all.

99
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,530
You got something in your hands.

100
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,870
Nothing.

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,260
Hands off and stand up straight.

102
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,620
Stand up straight!

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,850
Get it done straight.

104
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,340
It already is.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,350
You are my worst nightmare.

106
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,660
How come you don't change?

107
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,260
Will you be like this next year?

108
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,630
You will?

109
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,200
Ah-ha, is that so?

110
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,410
I'm watching you.

111
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,220
And Sun-Ah.

112
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,510
This isn't like you,

113
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,390
Sorry, sir.

114
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,900
I expected more from...

115
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,980
Why can't you stand up straight?

116
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,270
Sir!

117
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
Oh!

118
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,930
Victory Korea!

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,530
Is that a light stick?

120
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,570
Go Korea.

121
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,070
Gu Jin-Woo.

122
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,800
From now on, you sit in front of her.

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,480
And Sun-Ah, keep an eye on Jin-Woo.

124
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,740
And you...

125
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,760
go to toilet first ..

126
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,180
Thank you sir.

127
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,330
Pass.

128
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,380
- Sung-bin's open.
- Done.

129
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,660
Nice!

130
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,970
Please.

131
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,100
Yes! I've got Yuri!

132
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,840
<i>Make me feel like Ah yeah.</i>

133
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,750
<i>Just like I always imagined.</i>

134
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,000
<i>Always...</i>

135
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,840
I'll fail again.

136
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,870
Got much better! I got the feeling.

137
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,170
Yeah? You get it?

138
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,380
That's called the vibe?

139
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,090
Hey. Come on, yo,

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,910
One, two, three, four!

141
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,740
<i>Two Ants, yeah!</i>

142
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,040
<i>And three more ants. Yeah!</i>

143
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,730
<i>Total of five ants.</i>

144
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,340
He's got the real feeling.

145
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,330
How come you can't even beat him?

146
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,870
Him?

147
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,550
He's better?

148
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,510
That kind of vibe can't be learned.

149
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,490
Gu Jin-Woo.

150
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,640
You ever made an effort on anything?

151
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,860
No need for me.

152
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,330
Scary how good I'll be if I try.

153
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,880
You're all talk and no progress.

154
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,980
You're worse, giving her false hope.

155
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,440
Who is it?

156
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,810
Wanna bet?

157
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,400
Who plays basketball?
Switch to soccer.

158
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,030
Jin-Woo.

159
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,320
Clothes on please.

160
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,690
Who does he take it after?

161
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,810
Son.

162
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
Hi Dad.

163
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,340
I got a very interesting call
from your high school today.

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,980
That you'll be sitting in front of your class president
and promised to study?

165
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,380
I... did.

166
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,170
If that's true,

167
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,640
you deserve better.

168
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,200
Ta-da.

169
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,700
Food expenses keep rising.

170
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,600
I save by not attending cram schools.

171
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,080
Please just attend one.

172
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,680
He's fine.

173
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,320
He's about to study with Sun-Ah.

174
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,880
Let's see...

175
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,260
Greasy food will help.

176
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,140
Dad...

177
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,730
Stop it!

178
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,540
Attention!

179
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,240
Bow!

180
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,080
Good morning.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Again.

182
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,630
Attention! Bow!

183
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,380
Good morning.

184
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,560
Is this subject
being ignored because it's a minor?

185
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,520
No, sir.

186
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,890
Then... it's me you're ignoring.

187
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,530
Pop quiz in twenty minutes.
Fetch your textbooks.

188
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,240
Chop-chop.

189
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,910
Has anyone left theirs at home?

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,620
If that's the case...

191
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,090
I'd be happy to show my passion.

192
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,130
<i>Not everyone can handle his passion.</i>

193
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,590
Stand up!

194
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,510
<i>He's extra grumpy today.</i>

195
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,680
<i>And this is my chance.</i>

196
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,600
<i>A chance to skip the quiz,</i>

197
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,650
It's you.

198
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,110
Yes.

199
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,230
Should I stand at the back?

200
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,480
I know what you guys are thinking
right now.

201
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,830
What's gotten into him today, right?

202
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,730
Does studying only core subjects lead
to a rosy future

203
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,370
and great success?

204
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,290
Happiness is elsewhere.

205
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,350
This subject is about...

206
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,350
I HAD NO DREAMS - I HAVE NO DREAMS
I WILL NEVER HAVE DREAMS

207
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,760
...the life and being within it.

208
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,130
If you're not to be a slave to life,

209
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,610
immerse yourself in something.

210
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,210
Be it your dream or love...
Or even wind and trees...

211
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,200
<i>She always smells so good.</i>

212
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,200
Smells good.

213
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,830
I can smell it now.

214
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,210
How?

215
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,380
Gu Jin-Woo.

216
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,080
Thanks for earlier.

217
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,130
It's okay.
Anyway, today is a leg day.

218
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,350
Anyway, thanks.

219
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,590
Not for free. Why empty-handed?

220
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,510
You, get off.

221
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,570
Next time, buddy.

222
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,260
You really don't have a dream?

223
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,920
That's why you're not studying?

224
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,530
No, not true.

225
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,800
Then why?

226
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,630
I told you.

227
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,570
If I try,
I'm afraid I might be too good at it,

228
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,870
It scares me off.

229
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,710
Coming or not?

230
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,230
What's wrong with him?
I'm coming!

231
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,130
Let's keep it that way, okay?

232
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,420
Guys bring it on!

233
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,750
<i>Basketball is a thing these days.</i>

234
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,150
<i>Heard of "Slam Dunk"?</i>

235
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,580
<i>The left hand is just for
holding the ball.</i>

236
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,990
<i>It's all about the performance
not the score.</i>

237
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,410
<i>How cool you shoot
matters more than scoring.</i>

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
<i>Perfect shot.</i>

239
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,070
Seriously?

240
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,460
Mark Ji-Soo.

241
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,710
Go, go!

242
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,810
He's awesome.

243
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,430
- What are you doing?
- I didn't lose the ball.

244
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,510
Great job.

245
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
We lost the game!

246
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,390
It's your treat.
Let's compete with eating.

247
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,270
No, napping it is.

248
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,690
Let's do this.

249
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,240
Hey.

250
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,860
I won, right?

251
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,700
What do you want?

252
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,910
Stop bothering Sun-Ah.

253
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,660
It's no joke.

254
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,460
Next time, say it beforehand.

255
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,420
Dumbass.

256
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,560
Gu Jin-Woo.

257
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
What?

258
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,780
Take this.

259
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
What's that?

260
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,120
My prediction for next week's test.

261
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,750
I analyzed the patterns of each teacher.

262
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,320
So you're the exam guru.

263
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,880
What now?

264
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,070
This is a study guide.

265
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,760
I never asked for this,

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,830
You said it's not for free.

267
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,160
You will get at least half correct
if you study these.

268
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,100
Are you my mom or something?

269
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,610
I don't want to look you down.

270
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,200
So, you've been looking down on me?

271
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,300
Smartness can't be your excuse.

272
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,820
I didn't mean...

273
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,490
Do as you wish. I don't care.

274
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,350
That's not what I meant.

275
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,510
I don't respect those...

276
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,750
Who disrespect others for trying

277
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,040
when they don't try at all.

278
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,280
READ THE NOTES FIRST,
THEN DO FROM THE BEGINNING TO SENTENCE 36P.

279
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,280
So, this is how it's done.

280
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,960
But why is this so hard to follow?

281
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,960
That's it.

282
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,700
Not bad handwriting.

283
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,420
<i>I ended up reading the whole thing
before I knew it.</i>

284
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,380
<i>Because her handwriting
was too pretty.</i>

285
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,840
CONFUCIAN CEREMONY CLASS IN CHUNCHEON

286
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,260
Good morning.

287
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,680
The shorter one goes up.

288
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,270
Make a loop...

289
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,850
Let me.

290
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,860
I'm done with this.

291
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,070
It's too small.

292
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,110
Gu Jin-Woo!

293
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,870
You ok?

294
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,340
She is sun-shine.

295
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,010
- That's why her name is...
- Sun-Ah.

296
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,970
Question three was tricky.

297
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,220
Did you use factorization?

298
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,830
I did.

299
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,570
If you factorize...

300
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,270
Did you factor in your ignorance?

301
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:46,990
Move.

302
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,620
We are almost finished.

303
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,980
I have to study too, move.

304
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,960
- You?
- Move.

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,540
- Studying?
- Move now.

306
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,610
He's cranky today,

307
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,010
I'll come back later.

308
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,070
Ok.

309
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,200
<i>That's right. I really was studying.</i>

310
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,220
What is it?

311
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,680
Dad, does studying really
change our lives?

312
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,780
It can change a lot.

313
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,400
Honey. What's this?

314
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,110
What did you buy?

315
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,630
It's for the new recipe.

316
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,550
I told you, stop buying this stuff.

317
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,260
Can we eat something normal!

318
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,500
Son. If you're studying,
give it your all.

319
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,530
What's this? How much was this?

320
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,110
Come over here. Right now!

321
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,530
Study hard.
Like your life depends on it.

322
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,260
Get here now.

323
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,660
Gyeong-Ho!

324
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,430
I'm coming.

325
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,000
Sun-Ah.

326
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,900
Yes?

327
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,490
This is an epic hit.

328
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,160
Eugene's hairband!
How did you get it?

329
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,670
It was sold out. Let me!

330
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,500
Heard her?
It's Eugene's and sold out.

331
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm giving this to you
because you're prettier.

332
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,370
Thanks.

333
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,380
Which class is she?

334
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,950
Let me ask around.

335
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,450
Done.

336
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,220
Really?

337
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,740
- You did?
- But why?

338
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,100
Good.

339
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,540
Too good.

340
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,520
Ji-Soo!

341
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,840
Just a sec.

342
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,160
One, two,

343
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,250
two and a half...

344
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,490
Questions four and six.

345
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,200
You're on the right track,
but the answer's wrong.

346
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,700
So close.

347
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,290
Try again.

348
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,790
Tired. I'll do it later.

349
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,900
I'll give you ten.

350
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,460
I said I'm tired.

351
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,660
So?

352
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,290
Three is enough.

353
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,890
My speed is X.

354
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,440
Sun-Ah's speed is Y.
That means...

355
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,820
Why on earth should I do it?

356
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,760
Then don't! Stop whining and quit.

357
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,320
Why is that?

358
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,990
It's no use.

359
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,770
Give up math.

360
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,120
It is useful.

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,420
Never give up!

362
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,190
Yoon Ji-Soo.

363
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,200
Fifty-eight.

364
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,960
Gu Jin-Woo.

365
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,060
Eighty-six.

366
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,900
I knew you could do it.

367
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,110
Dreams come true.

368
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,990
Sir.

369
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,570
I am a born genius.

370
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,540
Sure, just keep doing
what you're doing.

371
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,770
You could soon get into class A.

372
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,670
Got three wrong.

373
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,370
Classic helps you focus, right?

374
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,240
Yes.

375
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,090
Can't hear you.

376
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,590
Yes, sir.

377
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,010
Good.

378
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,930
So, a genius.

379
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,940
A piece of cake.

380
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,920
Then why haven't you done it before?

381
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,570
You can still live
without a trig formula or root.

382
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,030
You don't say,
"Give me 3 square root of 4 tofu."

383
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,530
Never, you say one tofu.

384
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,540
Three square root of four is...
Six tofu.

385
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,500
Why do you try so hard?

386
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,170
I just do it even
when it seems useless.

387
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,090
You always get something out of it.

388
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,340
So preachy.

389
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,360
So childish.

390
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,870
Have you been childish?
It's hard to be one.

391
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,550
Ok, you keep it that way.

392
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,430
You keep it that way.

393
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,770
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

394
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,900
<i>Why would things disappear
so easily back then?</i>

395
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,530
<i>Why did the whole class
have to be punished for it?</i>

396
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,750
<i>The guilty ones remain silent anyway.</i>

397
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,370
What is this?

398
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,770
Dream Concert?

399
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,420
This stuff. Instead of studying.

400
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,130
You...

401
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,470
What...

402
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,220
Huh...

403
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,800
Dong-Hyun. I told you many times.

404
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,030
Why is there only food and no books?

405
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,680
Your parents think
you come here to study, right?

406
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,600
They don't know
you're here pigging out.

407
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,890
Where did you get the cash for these.

408
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,480
You stole the money to buy this, right?

409
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,980
Grow up. Dong-Hyun,

410
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,190
Sir.

411
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,110
How much is it?

412
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,550
How much is missing?

413
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,900
I can make it up.

414
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,230
Are you defying me?

415
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,850
No, Sir.

416
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,610
But you can't blame him for...

417
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,520
What?

418
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,800
For nothing.

419
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,430
How dare you.

420
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,070
It has nothing to do with his belly.

421
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,430
I can't believe this.
Isn't our class just perfect?

422
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,780
Gu Jin-Woo.

423
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,360
You're in trouble now.

424
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,350
On the ground.

425
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,950
Sir.

426
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,120
What you did to Dong-Hyun seems unfair.

427
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,710
Is there any proof that he stole it?

428
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,180
We should carefully investigate first

429
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,940
to see if it's stolen or just lost.

430
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,900
Sorry if I overstepped.

431
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,120
<i>I don't recall
whether the money was found or not.</i>

432
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,970
<i>What I do remember is...</i>

433
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,840
Stop staring at me. It's embarrassing.

434
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,760
What do you mean? It was so cool.

435
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,760
- Don't you think getting punished with us.
- Honestly,

436
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,020
it's fun.

437
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,500
Embarrassing.

438
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,450
<i>How steaming hot the hallway was.</i>

439
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,700
<i>And how breathtaking.</i>

440
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,950
<i>Sun-Ah was that day.</i>

441
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,100
<i>As the heat began to ease,</i>

442
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,590
<i>we went on the last field trip
before the senior year.</i>

443
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,140
Line up straight.

444
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,510
Let's go, class 3.

445
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,520
Let's go!

446
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,440
You in the middle,

447
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,650
you stole the money.

448
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,780
Tell the truth,
then I'll assume Tae-Wan stole it.

449
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,440
Shut up. Come here Byung Joo.

450
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,650
What!

451
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,660
So cute.

452
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,840
How can it be this boring?

453
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,020
Hey, You want some fun?

454
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Sure.

455
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,230
Guys, get up.

456
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,850
Come on.

457
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,360
Split up, up!

458
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,570
Dong-Hyun, trust yourself.
Think of all the food you had.

459
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,610
Here he comes.

460
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,880
Rock, paper, scissors.

461
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,220
I won!

462
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,810
Boom!

463
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,290
Rock, paper, scissors!

464
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,740
Hey come on!

465
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,030
My bad.

466
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,480
Get it done or change the position.

467
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,870
Sorry.

468
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,790
You can't change during...

469
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,630
This time I'm going to win.

470
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,460
- You're killing me.
- I can assure you.

471
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,590
No worries.

472
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,640
Are you boasting or what?

473
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,310
Hey! Get it done straight.

474
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,390
It already is.

475
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,230
You alright?

476
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,210
I nearly died.

477
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,880
It was just one person.

478
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,930
Is this funny?

479
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,560
Hey.

480
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,220
Of course it is.

481
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,500
It's just a game.

482
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,750
Everything is a game to you.

483
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,080
Grow up.

484
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,600
You're so messed up.

485
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,410
How messed up am I?

486
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,900
Let's hear it.

487
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,400
Never mind.

488
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,940
Sung-Bin.

489
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,170
Take it!

490
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,240
Are you kidding?

491
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,580
Guys come on.

492
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,960
Stop them!

493
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Come on!

494
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,970
Mr. Figaro is coming!

495
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm stuck in here! Save me!

496
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Duck goes.

497
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,380
Quack, quack.

498
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,270
Louder, duck goes.

499
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,540
Quack, quack.

500
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,610
Even on a field trip.

501
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,060
Slow down.

502
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,650
Slower.

503
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,280
What?

504
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,080
Stick to yours.

505
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,450
Sun-Ah, have a seat.

506
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,040
Thanks.

507
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,300
You know...

508
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,520
Dong-Hyun.

509
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,550
Huh?

510
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,090
Are you free after class today?

511
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,590
Why?

512
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,570
I have something to ask you.

513
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,260
Of course.
For sure.

514
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,470
Of course you are free.

515
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,760
What is it?

516
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,430
You can ask me.

517
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,270
No, but thanks.

518
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,780
You two. Are you guys okay now?

519
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Well...

520
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,240
I let him win a basketball game.

521
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,200
What?

522
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,730
Have you heard about Soyang High?

523
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,250
It's haunted, right?

524
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,370
Hey.

525
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,670
Hush now. I hate horror stories.

526
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,670
Behind you.

527
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,920
There's nothing --

528
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,220
You know.

529
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,390
<i>The other night.
When the rain poured down.</i>

530
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,230
<i>Top two students of the school</i>

531
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,900
<i>decided to stay behind
for the study hall session.</i>

532
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:49,950
<i>And one of them accidentally
dropped her red pen.</i>

533
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,330
<i>She shouldn't have tried to retrieve it.</i>

534
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,380
Jeez, you scared me.

535
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,720
And then what?

536
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,090
After that...

537
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,220
it goes around every school
and waits for the session to end.

538
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,730
Let's leave.

539
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,270
Wait up.

540
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,130
And the next is ours!

541
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,400
Hi, mom.

542
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,910
Now?

543
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,080
Yeah?

544
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,830
Finals are coming up.

545
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,020
So?

546
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,210
We only have two weeks.

547
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,800
That's enough. For a genius like me.

548
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,780
You don't attend cram schools?

549
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,470
A genius doesn't need one.

550
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,140
Then,

551
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,720
why don't you stay after class
and study with me from today.

552
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,500
From today?

553
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,060
With you?

554
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,960
You have a crush on me?

555
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,150
You wish.

556
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,150
I'm not into stupid guys.

557
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,320
Are you saying I'm stupid?

558
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,850
I've been going easy
on you all this time.

559
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,690
How thoughtful of you.

560
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,360
Let's do it.

561
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,300
It's a bet.

562
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,420
Bet?

563
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,650
With grades?

564
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,510
Yes, no more going easy.

565
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,370
What's your bet?

566
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,500
If I win...

567
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,050
Shave your head.

568
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,880
Shave?

569
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,210
Scared?

570
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,340
No?

571
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,380
Not even a little.

572
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,880
Instead...

573
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,050
only core subject scores.

574
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,300
Sure,

575
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,640
If I win...

576
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:27,970
You...

577
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,850
Untie your hair.

578
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,980
<i>I knew what was going on.</i>

579
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,950
<i>She was too scared to study alone.</i>

580
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,700
"You are the apple of my eye."

581
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,450
What's up with the apple?

582
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,050
"You are the apple of my eye."

583
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,330
You are precious to me.

584
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,970
Fuck you.

585
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,570
Apple!

586
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,430
Give up English as well.

587
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,550
Learn the skills useful to live.

588
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,170
Skills!

589
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,200
I know you.

590
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
It's you.

591
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,780
All you need is love.

592
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,530
"How much money did you have?"

593
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,530
"I have a little money."

594
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,470
"You have a lot of money."

595
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,210
Good for you.

596
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,960
Show your vibe.

597
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,580
Hey, that's my part.

598
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,280
Go freshen up. I'll give you ten.

599
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,200
Three is enough.

600
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,460
"MAK-YEOK-JI-U"

601
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,310
Dad!

602
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,570
Times up.

603
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,580
Wait up, wait up.

604
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,700
All good?

605
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,190
You scared me.

606
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,560
Why?

607
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,770
Looks that good?

608
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,190
I kept my word.

609
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,520
Clumsy.

610
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,770
Everyone's into you.

611
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,770
TO: SUN-AH
FROM: MIN WOO - THE ONE WHO LIKES YOU

612
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,030
Pick one and date him

613
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,690
I have to study.

614
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,300
What's the point of it?

615
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,510
Good college.

616
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,890
That's your dream?

617
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,220
Dream?

618
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,850
What is it that you want to be?

619
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,860
It's raining.

620
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,420
How could a smartie like you
forget an umbrella.

621
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,980
Sorry.

622
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,520
Wow.

623
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,860
Sorry.

624
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,240
I have one too.

625
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,370
Don't you dare.

626
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,120
Too late.

627
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
Bring it on.

628
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,400
I'm fine out here.

629
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,370
<i>Light filled the bus stop.</i>

630
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,660
<i>We were glowing back then.</i>

631
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,590
Why the sudden change?

632
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,110
Too much change.

633
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,580
What were you thinking?
It's getting colder.

634
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,970
No more getting hit on by girls.

635
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,800
Not interested in them,

636
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,300
And guys, too.

637
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,210
Come on.

638
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,210
<i>She won the bet.
Why did she untie her hair?</i>

639
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,370
<i>I was curious.
But I couldn't dare to ask her.</i>

640
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,940
I'm back.

641
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,980
Hey, you.

642
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,010
Go wash up.

643
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,180
What's that?

644
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,650
Folding laundry.

645
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,600
Why did you wash this?

646
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,030
I should have let it stink?

647
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,970
Yes! You ruined it.

648
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,210
Did I do something wrong?

649
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,110
Throw it to me.

650
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,120
<i>In my senior year,</i>

651
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,120
<i>I grew to like study hall sessions.</i>

652
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,840
<i>Because I could see Sun-Ah
who was in a different class.</i>

653
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,500
KOREAN COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST 2024

654
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,260
<i>Finally, the day has come.</i>

655
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,740
Thank you, am I late?

656
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,770
Good luck.

657
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,440
Let's go!

658
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,940
<i>Six years in elementary school.</i>

659
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,150
<i>Three years in middle school.</i>

660
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,880
<i>Three years in high school</i>

661
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,910
<i>12 years of our school life
are evaluated.</i>

662
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,290
<i>In just a single day.</i>

663
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,210
<i>I thought I would feel relieved</i>

664
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,490
<i>but strangely, I felt empty.</i>

665
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,630
<i>That's why... we went wild.</i>

666
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,900
<i>You've fallen for me.</i>

667
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,050
<i>Under the dazzling light
You've fallen for me.</i>

668
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,060
<i>You've fallen for me.</i>

669
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,630
<i>Smile isn't enough.</i>

670
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,230
<i>Say something.</i>

671
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,450
<i>You've fallen for me.</i>

672
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,730
<i>In the heat of Saturday night.</i>

673
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,890
<i>You've fallen for me.</i>

674
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,870
<i>Level with me and speak your heart.</i>

675
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,590
<i>You try to play it off cool.</i>

676
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,870
<i>But I can see through
what you are up to.</i>

677
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,330
<i>You've fallen for me.</i>

678
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,750
<i>What's with that vague glance?</i>

679
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,650
<i>You've fallen for me.</i>

680
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,170
<i>Dance with me.</i>

681
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,630
<i>Come on come on.</i>

682
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,320
<i>The moment my eyes met yours</i>

683
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,590
<i>the flame of passion sparked.</i>

684
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:41,410
<i>Stand by me stand by me stand by me.</i>

685
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,320
<i>Say the word</i>

686
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,370
<i>I will get stars from the sky.</i>

687
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,460
<i>Stand by me stand by me stand by me.</i>

688
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,630
<i>Kiss me on the cheek.</i>

689
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,900
Who suggested the beach in winter?

690
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,550
Sorry.

691
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,200
Winter beach beats all!

692
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,650
Traitor!

693
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,950
You told me you're going in.

694
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,880
Get him.

695
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,900
What's so funny?

696
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,900
They are more childish than kids.

697
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,450
So childish.

698
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,740
I wanted to ask you something.

699
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,790
Yes?

700
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,010
What do you think of me?

701
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,550
One sec.

702
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,630
This is your last day on Earth.

703
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,070
I wonder how we'll turn out.

704
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,550
Yuri's husband?

705
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,900
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

706
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,260
- Date Sun-Ah.
- I said serious.

707
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,680
- Be serious.
- Alright.

708
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,150
In fact...

709
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,670
I can't even apply
to the same college as her.

710
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,750
- L...
- How about you, Sung-bin?

711
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:52,480
You go first.

712
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,170
After getting into law school,
I'll study for the bar right away.

713
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,180
And I want to marry early.

714
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,340
- What's he saying?
- Smug face.

715
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,780
I'll get a girlfriend for sure.

716
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,780
I'm going to get some sleep.

717
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,120
Like a baby.

718
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,170
I haven't had a good sleep
for a while.

719
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,050
I'll pass the audition
and be a K-pop star.

720
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,230
Then work hard for a few years.

721
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,200
I'll marry Jung Woo-sung.

722
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,140
Her dream is way too big and specific.

723
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,450
Have you even met Jung Woo-sung?

724
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,830
What about you Sun-Ah?

725
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,190
First of all, good college.

726
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,180
And then...

727
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,450
I'm not sure yet.

728
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,490
You dream too small.

729
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,020
Take some from Ji-soo,
she dreams too big.

730
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,410
- Ask me too.
- What about you?

731
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,580
- I have to prove it.
- Prove what?

732
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,250
That I'm a great human.

733
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,670
Great my ass.

734
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,760
What do you mean?

735
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,600
Someone who can change the world
by just being there.

736
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,560
That's too much.

737
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,550
We barely finished our CSAT.

738
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,400
Too much is fine! It's all over.

739
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,280
We're free now. Pass on.

740
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,330
It's still broad daylight.

741
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,760
Your birthday is a long way off.

742
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,160
I'm not the only one here...

743
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,540
Cool.

744
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,620
Who cares?

745
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,150
CSAT is over.

746
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,490
You're right. Let's just drink up.

747
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,070
Dreams come true.

748
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,430
Dreams come true.

749
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,940
Jin-Woo nhà tôi ấy à?

750
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,950
He's always been bright.

751
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,940
I'Il call you
when the results come in.

752
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,750
Wow.

753
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,240
My son!

754
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,950
What if you really do get
accepted to good colleges?

755
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,130
Should we find a place in Seoul?

756
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,200
Are we moving to Seoul?

757
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,100
They have dormitories,

758
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,710
What a shame.

759
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,960
SUN-AH

760
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,080
Hello?

761
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,720
Sun-Ah?

762
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,580
What is it?

763
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,980
What should I do?

764
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,030
I messed up my answer sheet.

765
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,490
I scored 30 points
less than I expected.

766
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,080
This never happened to me.

767
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,940
Made the worst mistake...

768
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,030
during the most important exam.

769
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,990
What should I do really?

770
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,860
Studying is all I'm good at.

771
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:04,890
It's cold.

772
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,220
Let's go inside somewhere.

773
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:24,310
Sun-Ah.

774
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:28,170
You do know I like you a lot?

775
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,000
Huh?

776
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,090
Regardless of your CSAT score,

777
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,920
I'll still like you.

778
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,310
You...

779
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,360
Read the room.

780
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,400
I'm sorry.

781
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,220
I'Il take back my words.

782
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,580
Forget about it.

783
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,560
<i>Failing the CSAT felt like a failure
in life back then.</i>

784
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,910
<i>It's just one of the many tests.</i>

785
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,770
<i>That's all.</i>

786
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:53,380
Congratulations on your graduation.

787
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,010
<i>Sung-bin got accepted to a law school
in Sinchon, Seoul.</i>

788
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,700
<i>He told me he played safe.</i>

789
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,330
<i>Smug face.</i>

790
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,490
It's me, Venerable.

<i>He got into the Catholic University.</i>

794
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,520

<i>Tae-Wan got accepted into University of Jeju,
well-known for stones, wine, and women.</i>

of getting a girlfriend.</i>

799
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:33,570
<i>The heavens must be touched
by his wish.</i>

800
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,850
It's Byeong-Ju, with J.

801
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,840
I'm literally graduating now...

802
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,000
<i>Sleepyhead Byeong-Ju was always late.</i>

803
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,110
- Thank you.
<i>- His acceptance was late, too.</i>

804
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,110
<i>Can't believe he overcame
a waitlist of 120 students.</i>

805
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,000
College!

806
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,130

<i>- Lucky him.</i>

807

I'm going to a college!

00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,000
I can't believe we just graduated.

815

We're twenty now.

816
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:30,210
I should've passed the audition
as a teenager.

817
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,920
Don't worry, they reached out to you.

818
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,640
That's true but...

819
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,640
Anyway.

820
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:43,030
Everyone's crush, miss Sun-Ah Oh.

821
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:44,580
A word?

822
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,030
I wasn't...

823
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,660
You're humble... overly.

824
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,790
I hate you.

825
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,560
I'm just grateful.

826
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm not special.

827
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,390
I feel sorry too.

828
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,790
Who are you most grateful for?

829
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,550
Tell me.

830
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,960
Who's your crush?

831
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,600
- Want to know?
- Please.

832
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,310
- Don't tell anyone.
- I swear.

833
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,270
I would...

834
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,760
Ladies,

835
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,020
Congratulations.

836
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,050
<i>We were transitioning
from mere dreaming</i>

837
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,380
<i>to actually achieving it.</i>

838
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,560
<i>But still...</i>

839
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,140
<i>we believed our potential
was limitless.</i>

840
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,980
<i>And that our dreams would come true.</i>

841
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,060
So...

842
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,390
A teacher then?

843
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,490
I guess so.

844
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,990
Are there guys too?

845
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:26,990
Don't know.

846
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:30,620
You're going to study only, right?

847
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,460
I'Il date too.

848
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,440
Wait.

849
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,620
Your arm.

850
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:43,830
Sorry?

851
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,330
Show me.

852
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,610

Couple's set?

898
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,780
It's a set for two.

899
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,280
How long have you been dating?

900
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,410
We're not...

901
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,280
Oh, not for long?
You're at a great stage.

Jin-Woo.

904
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,020
The thing is...

905
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,990
I lose stuff.

906
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:02,270
I sleep a lot
and I'm not good at cleaning.

907
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,390
I also make stupid mistakes,

908
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,350
like the one back at the final exam.

909
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,290
Also...

910
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,290
I lag behind the trends.

911
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,920
So?

912
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,910
What I mean is...

913
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:24,900
Who you think I am might be
a figment of your imagination.

914
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,940
My imagination isn't that vivid.

915
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,290
Think carefully.

916
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,830
If you .. Really like me.

917
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,160
But I do.

918
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,230
<i>Why is she saying this?</i>

919
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:51,490
<i>Am I getting dumped
before even asking her out?</i>

920
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,260
<i>I became anxious
as I need to ask her out like a man.</i>

921
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,860
<i>I was still immature then.</i>

922
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,920

01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,040
It's nothing.

932
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,120
Go ahead.

933
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,000
- Bye.
- Later.

934
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:50,880
SORRY
I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT

935
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,430
Sun...

936
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,220
Sun-Ah!

937
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,850
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

938
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,600
I'm fine.

939
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:04,180
I was practicing with friends.

940
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,180
Sun-Ah.

941
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,660
There's a tournament coming next month.

942
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:11,000
<i>Fight again?</i>

943
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,110
No, mixed martial arts is a sport.

944
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,000
<i>Why are you doing such a thing?</i>

945
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,610
<i>When do you study?</i>

946
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,180
You're getting it wrong.

947
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,830
I'm doing it to boost my studying.

948
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,470
It's a serious sport
and looks real cool

949
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,290
when you come watch.

950
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,000
<i>Can't you just stop fighting?</i>

951
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,670
<i>Never mind. Bye.</i>

952
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:31,650
Wait...

953
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:40,160
It's just a sport.

954
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:45,480
COLLEGIATE MMA FIGHTS

955
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:50,860
You got this. Let's get them.

956
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,630
Should I go one hand?

957
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,900
Sure, one hand.

958
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,210
<i>I invited Sun-Ah.</i>

959
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,950
<i>But wasn't sure she would come.</i>

960
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,300
One more.

961
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,380
Nice!

962
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,680
Pull back.

963
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,770
Keep calm, Jin-Woo!

964
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:10,080
How was it?

965
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,570
Pretty cool?

966
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,700
It would have been better if I won.

967
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,200
Do you really have to do
something so dangerous?

968
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,910
It's far from dangerous.

969
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:23,200
In fact it's such a stress reliever.

970
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:26,480
It's just a fight, nothing more.

971
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,770
Don't you worry. I'm tough enough.

972
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:34,020
You're so immature.

973
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,900
Grow up.

974
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:41,020
Come and watch one more game.

975
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,160
You'll change your mind if I win.

976
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,340
No, thanks.

977
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,760
One last time.

978
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,030
One last time.

979
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:55,120
You always say one last time.

980
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,650
What are you looking at?

981
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,120
Let's just go.

982
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,030
I'm holding back for you.

983
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,180
Off you go then.

984
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,640
Maybe teach him to control his temper.

985
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,930
- Let's go.
- Where are you off to?

986
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,140
- Just go.
- Off to hotel?

987
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,910
As a senior, I should pay for you.

988
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:18,890
Please let's just go.

989
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,230
Aren't you a college dropout?

990
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:22,480
I was not a dropout.

991
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,150
Hey, pretty.

992
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,630
If he doesn't satisfy you,
come back here.

993
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,490
We'll treat you well.

994
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,560
Damn you!

995
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:56,060
BUS STOP

996
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,590
Surprised?

997
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,680
But martial arts made me tougher.

998
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:09,660
Doesn't hurt me at all.

999
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,460
If it were a fair fight,
I'd win easily.

1000
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,390
I begged you to just go,

1001
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,040
How can I just go
after hearing such words?

1002
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,310
Rain?

1003
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,570
You could've listened to me
just for once!

1004
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,960
I wanted to protect.

1005
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,290
Protect you.

1006
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,950
But was that so wrong?

1007
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:09,450
I don't get why you're mad.

1008
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,040
Didn't you see this coming?

1009
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:14,240
I can't believe you did that.

1010
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,350
When will you stop being childish?

1011
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,330
Childish?

1012
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,480
Yes, immature.

1013
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:27,150
Why do you see
everything I do as immature?

1014
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:30,130
Is protecting something
precious immature?

1015
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,400
You're an adult now.

1016
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,540
You shouldn't have done it.

1017
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:34,780
Yes. I'm immature.

1018
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,100
I did that to impress you.

1019
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,810
I am so immature...

1020
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,100
that I liked you alone.

1021
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,270
Then quit.

1022
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,080
<i>My mind said stop.</i>

1023
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,700
<i>But my body kept moving away.</i>

1024
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,120
Gu Jin-Woo.

1025
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,790
You know nothing.

1026
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,040
<i>My mind said stop.</i>

1027
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:17,960
<i>But my mouth kept being childish.</i>

1028
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:19,970
Right.

1029
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:24,100
I'm sorry a dumbass like me
liked someone out of my league.

1030
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,840
<i>I didn't know back then.</i>

1031
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,240
<i>Women mature faster than men.</i>

1032
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,830
<i>And men...</i>

1033
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,590
<i>realize it much later.</i>

1034
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,770
Hello?

1035
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:44,980
What?

1036
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,260
A big fight?

1037
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,260
They're not making up?

1038
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,640
So, it's over.

1039
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,930
Then why am I here?

1040
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,510
I should go.

1041
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,130
<i>They hit the road immediately.</i>

1042
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,510
<i>Not toward me.</i>

1043
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:01,800
<i>But toward Sun-Ah.</i>

1044
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,890
<i>But nobody could beat
Sung-bin's Jaguar. Smug face.</i>

1045
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:19,020
You alright?

1046
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:24,030
<i>Tae-Wan flew to Seoul
and when he failed to meet her.</i>

1047
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,430
<i>He came to see me instead
before going back to Jeju Island.</i>

1048
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:29,930
You're saying that...

1049
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:32,110
I was the only one who called you?

1050
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:34,560
This is not funny.

1051
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,250
Those traitors.

1052
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,320
Guess they're busy.

1053
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:39,680
Busy my ass.

1054
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,200
I flew all the way to here.

1055
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,200
To cheer you up.

1056
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,270
Thank me...

1057
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:50,180
Drink up.

1058
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,870
<i>That sneaky bastard.</i>

1059
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,530
<i>I should have known.</i>

1060
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:59,620
<i>Memories of you.</i>

1061
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:02,580
<i>The love we had now lingers</i>

1062
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:05,840
<i>like a thorn that pricks my heart.</i>

1063
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,670
Stop!

1064
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,050
<i>Please go...</i>

1065
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,200
Sun-Ah!

1066
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,930
<i>Walk far away.</i>

1067
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:16,550
Oh Sun-Ah!

1068
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,110
<i>It tortures my</i>

1069
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,710
...go.

1070
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,190
<i>Walk far away.</i>

1071
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:30,040
<i>Memories of you.</i>

1072
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:42,930
Nature relaxes you.

1073
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,040
Thanks.

1074
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:47,120
Friends...

1075
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,470
are the best.

1076
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:52,910
Sun-Ah!

1077
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,010
You and Jin-Woo.

1078
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,920
Maybe you'll get back together?

1079
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,340
If that happens...

1080
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,840
I might regret it forever.

1081
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,140
What are you talking about?

1082
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,220
I'm sorry but...

1083
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,690
I couldn't miss this opportunity.

1084
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:39,410
It was all on you.

1085
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:42,300
If it were you,
would you hold it back?

1086
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,820
Of course.

1087
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:48,840
If it were me, I'd run even if
she tells me to fight back.

1088
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:53,850
<i>The memories of our love...</i>

1089
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,320
<i>Pierces into my heart.</i>

1090
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,820
I told you to stop.

1091
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,570
Sorry.

1092
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,130
It's close. Come quick.

1093
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:07,940
Check out Champ Nightclub.

1094
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,910
Come experience it... for yourself.

1095
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,710
Here you go.

1096
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,170
Almost same name!

1097
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,370
This is my song.

1098
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,250
I can't miss this opportunity.

1099
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:21,800
<i>The memories of our love...</i>

1100
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,590
<i>Pierces into my heart.</i>

1101
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:24,550
Don't start.

1102
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,710
<i>That pricks my heart.</i>

1103
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:27,950
Sorry.

1104
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,720
- You're huge.
- What?

1105
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:36,450
Mr. Soldier, fix your uniform.

1106
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,200
I don't think I can fasten it.

1107
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:19,230
<i>Dad said this might be the time.</i>

1108
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,110
To the ground.

1109
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,530
Get it together.

1110
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:25,700
Get up.

1111
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:26,860
Up.

1112
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:28,530
Attention!

1113
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:29,940
Salute.

1114
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,350
Salute.

1115
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,620
Have you lost your mind?

1116
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,160
A soldier doesn't wear that.

1117
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:46,840
<i>Spur of my youth is now gone.</i>

1118
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,290
<i>Sun-Ah is gone.</i>

1119
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,480
Seven.

1120
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:00,360
Eight.

1121
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:04,780
Three.

1122
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:08,470
Four.

1123
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,200
Eyes fixed forward.

1124
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:14,870
Girlfriend?

1125
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,680
No, sir.

1126
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:20,520
Jump and shout out the first name
that comes to mind.

1127
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,490
Descend.

1128
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,740
Fuck you, Sung-bin.

1129
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,930
Fuck you.

1130
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:32,960
How about transferring to Seoul?

1131
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,830
I felt sorry for your mistake at CSAT.

1132
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,840
And you seem eager to come.

1133
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:42,120
I do... but a transfer is too much.

1134
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,740
I think you should
start your career at Seoul.

1135
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:49,060
It doesn't seem problematic for now.

1136
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:53,250
In case you find someone
to get married to one day.

1137
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:56,820
One of you might not be able to work.

1138
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:58,640
Sung-Bin.

1139
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:02,010
What kind of person do you want to be?

1140
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,970
A lawyer, of course.

1141
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,800
That's an occupation.

1142
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:08,360
Not the job.

1143
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:10,860
Your dream.

1144
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,370
Aren't they the same?

1145
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:17,770
I'm sorry.

1146
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,390
I didn't mean it.
It wasn't my intention at all.

1147
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:23,150
I'm sorry.

1148
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:35,400
ONE YEAR LATER

1149
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:39,180
<i>Typhoon Nabi is now moving north</i>

1150
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:44,020
<i>and causing heavy rain of 200mm per hour

1152
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,550
Hold it tight!

1153
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,160
Attention, ten-minute break.

1154
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:01,700
Ten-minute break.

1155
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,910
- What did he say?
- Ten minutes off.

1156
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,750
Ten minutes...

1157
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:16,880
Corporal Gu Jin-Woo.

1158
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,840
Permission to speak, sir.

1159
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:22,010
My hometown
is also facing severe flooding.

1160
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:22,930
So?

1161
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,350
I'm requesting...

1162
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,960
permission to call someone there.

1163
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,270
Parents?

1164
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:30,610
A friend.

1165
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,770
What?

1166
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:32,840
Three...

1167
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,700
One minute is enough.

1168
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,300
Are you out of your mind?

1169
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,870
On the ground.

1170
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,410
On the ground.

1171
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,350
Corporal.

1172
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,790
Have you lost your mind?

1173
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:57,220
Gu Jin-Woo.

1174
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,170
Take it.

1175
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,000
Corporal Gu Jin-Woo.

1176
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:11,310
Three minutes.

1177
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:12,750
Thank you, sir.

1178
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:17,480
TEMPORARY SHELTER

1179
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:30,530
Hello?

1180
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:33,420
<i>Hello? Sun-Ah? Is that you?</i>

1181
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,740
Jin-Woo?

1182
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,990
Where are you? Are you ok?

1183
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,170
How's home? Were you hurt?

1184
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,930
<i>Breathe.</i>

1185
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:45,550
<i>Slow down.</i>

1186
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,590
So, all good?

1187
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,720
Can't say all good.

1188
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,960
But my family is safe.

1189
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,750
<i>Thank God!</i>

1190
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,200
Glad you're safe, hanging up now.

1191
01:21:58,230 --> 01:21:59,240
<i>Thanks.</i>

1192
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,200
For checking on me.

1193
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:05,690
<i>No worries.</i>

1194
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:12,200
If you're gone, my memories are too.

1195
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:14,200
Such a slick talker.

1196
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:16,990
You never called me on your leave.

1197
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:19,910
I didn't want to bother you
with Sung-Bin.

1198
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,210
What do you mean by bothering?

1199
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,210
Aren't you guys dating?

1200
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:26,380
We never did.

1201
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:27,740
<i>Really?</i>

1202
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:28,890
No.

1203
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:30,420
Who says so?

1204
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,870
Are you dating someone else?

1205
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,220
None of your business.

1206
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,270
<i>Why didn't you date Sung-bin?</i>

1207
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,400
He's fine.

1208
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,850
<i>Well...</i>

1209
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:53,410
I don't think he really liked me.

1210
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:55,320
That's not true.

1211
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,280
He was so into you.

1212
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:00,420
I think he saw me...

1213
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:02,710
as someone I'm not.

1214
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:08,510
It's silly to say this, but...

1215
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,800
You're the only one

1216
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:17,100
who liked me as I am.

1217
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,320
Then why did you let me go?

1218
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,030
I was...

1219
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,590
scared.

1220
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,950
I heard things.

1221
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:36,100
That dating loses its spark over time.

1222
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:41,250
<i>The start of a relationship
can be the end of it.</i>

1223
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,800
Maybe I...

1224
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,990
wished you'd like me longer.

1225
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,680
How nice of you.

1226
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:55,220
<i>But aren't you the same?</i>

1227
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:56,630
Me?

1228
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:58,930
<i>That day, at the park.</i>

1229
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,230
Why didn't you let me answer?

1230
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,110
I thought you'd say no.

1231
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,140
Then...

1232
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,390
I won't be allowed to like you
anymore.

1233
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:17,880
I was afraid.

1234
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,510
Jin-Woo.

1235
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,860
Thanks for...

1236
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,680
liking me.

1237
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,460
I also...

1238
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:13,390
<i>I also like me
from those days when I liked you.</i>

1239
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:41,420
<i>Time flew after the discharge.</i>

1240
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,480
<i>Everyone else was busy
with their careers.</i>

1241
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:46,840
<i>But some still held onto dreams.</i>

1242
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:49,260
This is nice.

1243
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,810
Should we buy it?

1244
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:56,230
<i>- Byeong-Ju got a job at a furniture company</i>.
- How much is...

1245
01:25:57,810 --> 01:25:59,140
<i>For reasons unknown,</i>

1246
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,080
<i>He became the top seller.</i>

1247
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,370
<i>Tae-Wan had no girlfriend
in university.</i>

1248
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:13,970
<i>But his dream came true
with the lady from his high school days!</i>

1249
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,480
Are you working or not?

1250
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,500
I love you so much.

1251
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,360
<i>Sung-bin followed his dad's advice</i>

1252
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:24,960
<i>and chose to become a prosecutor
instead of a lawyer.</i>

- So you're the son of Judge Ahn?
- Yes, sir.

1256
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,640
How's he doing?

1257
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,930
Cut, cut.

<i>Dong-Hyun built a K-pop career

1260
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,410
Feel it.

You're doing great.
Just need some vibe,

01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:03,510
Express the fresh

Good morning.

Good morning.

every Monday.

1277
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,170
There.

1278
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,920
Dislike for this.

1279
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:54,920
Dislike.

1280
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:59,340
Sir, they asked
when you'll be uploading.

1281
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:02,930
If you're late again,
there's a penalty.

1282
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,100
Okay, then.

1283

You called.

01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,280
<i>You're the same.</i>

1297
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,850
Since I'm a great human,
I can accept if you want.

1298
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,760
<i>Then...</i>

1299
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:06,340
<i>I'll level with you.</i>

1300
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:17,410
<i>The ceremony is about to begin.
Please take your seats.</i>

1301
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,690
Ji-soo, don't you need a bed?

1302
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,740
I can give you a discount.

1303
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,770
Come to Jeju. I cook great ramyeon.

1304
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:26,360
When do they serve food?

1305
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,730
I heard food here is great.

1306
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,160
So this is it then?

1307
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:32,240
I'm gonna trip the groom.

1308
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,830
Grow up.

1309
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:36,460
Give her your blessings.

1310
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:37,810
You don't understand.

1311
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:41,300
Wishing the girl
I liked be happy with another guy?

1312
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,080
No man can do that.

1313
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,800
Not happening.

1314
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:48,650
<i>Bride is about to walk down the aisle.</i>

1315
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:54,130
<i>Please extend your applause
as we welcome her.</i>

1316
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,500
<i>Here comes the bride.</i>

1317
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,270
<i>Sung-bin got it wrong.</i>

1318
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:59,030
<i>If a man loves a woman truly,</i>

1319
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:02,240
<i>he would wish her happiness</i>

1320
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:05,950
<i>when she finds someone she loves.</i>

1321
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,430
Awesome.

1322
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:19,180
Kiss time for the newlyweds.

1323
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:21,190
Applause, everyone.

1324
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,900
Now, kiss.

1325
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,510
Guys at the back look too scary.

1326
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:32,870
Great job, everyone.

1327
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,910
Let's take a picture of just us.

1328
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,080
Stay.

1329
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:42,740
Can you snap a photo of us?
We're good friends of hers.

1330
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,170
She might disagree with that.

1331
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,590
Say cheese.

1332
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:53,070
- Done.
- Thank you.

1333
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,370
Congratulations.

1334
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,130
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1335
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:57,950
Hey.

1336
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:01,470
How do you feel
about getting married to our Prom Queen,

1337
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,540
that we could not dare to ask out.

1338
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,070
It's like a dream.

1339
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,890
I'll treasure her always.

1340
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:09,810
Speaking of which...

1341
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,560
We can't easily let her go...

1342
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,010
- So for one last time.
- How about a kiss?

1343
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,900
Hey!

1344
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:17,980
Apologies.

1345
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,860
He's gone mad.

1346
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:21,980
Sure.

1347
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:25,160
On one condition.

1348
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:29,750
You have to kiss him first.

1349
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,310
- That's not fair.
- I pass.

1350
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:33,760
That's a straight no.

1351
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:47,160
I'd be glad if Jin-Woo asks me out.

1352
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:18,690
Yes, I'm a dumbass.

1353
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,480
If you go now, it's over.

1354
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:23,180
Fine, it's over.

1355
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,590
Sorry.

1356
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:44,320
I made you wait.

1357
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:12,330
How much is it? I can pay.

1358
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,820
MAKE HER MY GIRLFRIEND

1359
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,100
I LIKE YOU TOO

1360
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:52,410
Sun-Ah, I like you so much!

1361
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:55,260
I love you, Sun-Ah.

1362
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,460
Thanks for liking me.

1363
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,880
I really liked you as well.

1364
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:50,520
I'll stay childish just like this.

1365
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:53,090
Please!

1366
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,700
<i>The girl we liked then...</i>

1367
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:27,210
<i>she was our dream and our youth.</i>

1368
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,490
<i>I'm still living in that dream</i>

1369
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:35,110
<i>and I'll never wake up.</i>
