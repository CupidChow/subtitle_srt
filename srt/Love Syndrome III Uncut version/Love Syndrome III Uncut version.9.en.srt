1
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,180
- Day, I’ll return these myself.
- No.

2
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,500
- I’ll do it.
- Day!

3
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,700
Don’t worry.

4
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,420
Don’t you know how calm I am?

5
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,420
These are yours.

6
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,740
Take them back.

7
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,660
Tonight, Itt has someone to sleep with.

8
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,220
What are you two?

9
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,100
A couple.

10
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,940
If I hadn’t known that you two were a couple,

11
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,860
I would’ve probably pressed forward.

12
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,140
Now that it’s clear,

13
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,700
I’ll accept it.

14
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,100
Good.

15
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,660
Oh.

16
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,640
One more thing.

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
The bathroom isn’t soundproof.

18
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,840
Have some decency.

19
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
It’s just a sound.

20
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,340
I don’t care who’s eavesdropping.

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000
I don’t mind that.

22
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,800
P’Day! I’m so sorry for giving P’Itt a cut.

23
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
Let me feed you.

24
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,160
Aw!

25
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,920
Why do you have to be harsh?

26
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,080
P’Day and P’Itt seem really close.

27
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
Yeah,

28
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
we are.

29
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,700
So, how long have you known each other?

30
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,300
Well, longer than I can remember.

31
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,860
Does that mean you know whom P’Itt is dating?

32
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,020
Yeah, I do.

33
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,900
Ouch!

34
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,820
Is that person cute?

35
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Do you think I am cute?

36
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,440
- I knew it!
- I knew it!

37
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Whenever you two are together,

38
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,280
I can smell love in the air!

39
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,200
Yeah!

40
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
So jealous!

41
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,520
Everyone’s dating someone except us.

42
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
So sad.

43
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,960
Boys, is the beverage ready?

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,560
- Come get some.
- Let’s get a drink.

45
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,560
- Please excuse us.
- Bye-bye.

46
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,960
Itt.

47
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,060
Hm?

48
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,860
Do you know who took a shower next to the bathroom you were in this evening?

49
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,660
Who? You?

50
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,460
Peace.

51
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,100
What? This is going to be awkward.

52
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,980
It won’t be.

53
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,180
You don’t have to worry about him.

54
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,380
You brought me into this.

55
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,380
It’s embarrassing

56
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,580
And now they’re going to talk about it.

57
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,140
Why do you have to be ashamed?

58
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,820
You don’t need to care

59
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,940
what others say or think.

60
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,580
All you need to care about right now

61
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,620
is how I remember you.

62
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
How much of me can you remember?

63
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,340
I told you. I need it today and now!

64
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,780
- You need to get me a cake!
- Itt!

65
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,540
Can you not?

66
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,020
I’m a fuss to you? Why do you make me look like I’m in the wrong?

67
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,280
Are you mad fighting me over a cake?

68
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,160
You think this is just about cake?

69
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,160
The problem is you not keeping your promise.

70
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,740
Day.

71
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,620
Day.

72
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,860
Bring me to the bakery tomorrow, please.

73
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,980
Hm.

74
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,340
Day.

75
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,740
What?

76
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,700
I’m sleepy.

77
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,540
Then go to sleep.

78
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,180
Why are you here?

79
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,500
Sleep upstairs with me.

80
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,460
I don’t want to sleep alone.

81
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,420
Please.

82
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,140
If you’re not coming, I’ll sleep here.

83
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,780
God!

84
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,460
Why would you sleep here? It’s cold!

85
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,620
You’re going to get sick.

86
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,620
Why are you not coming with me?

87
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,100
Have you stopped being moody?

88
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,720
I have.

89
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Sure?

90
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,720
Of course.

91
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,140
Right, let’s go upstairs.

92
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
You’re coming, right?

93
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,160
Ah-huh.

94
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,760
How’s your headache?

95
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,880
Well,

96
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,840
it should get better soon.

97
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,880
Tomorrow should be fine.

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,880
Take me to P’Nam’s bakery tomorrow.

99
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,700
Promise?

100
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
Yeah.

101
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,220
Pinky promise.

102
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,300
You’re so cute.

103
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,940
Let me give you a massage.

104
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,120
I guess that’s me in your memory.

105
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,480
Like what?

106
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,440
Like ...

107
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,320
Childish, spoiled, and believing that you’ll never leave me.

108
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,720
Hey! Day.

109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
Day.

110
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,860
This tent is even less soundproof than the bathroom!

111
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,500
Day.

112
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,580
If you keep quiet, nobody can hear us.

113
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,660
Aw! Day.

114
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,420
Day.

115
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,260
It’s embarrassing.

116
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,500
Day.

117
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,340
Augh!

118
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,780
Day.

119
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,720
Day, what’s wrong?

120
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
Day.

121
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,680
Day.

122
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey!

123
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,760
Hey!

124
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,480
Hey!

125
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,700
- Hm?
- Hey!

126
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,600
Why do you keep biting? Are you a dog?

127
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,280
Get up. You’re heavy.

128
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
I’m not!

129
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,640
In this tent,

130
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,540
you’ve laid on my lap like you just did, right?

131
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,140
I hugged you like I just did too?

132
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,560
Right?

133
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,240
Day? You can remember now?

134
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,960
Just a bit.

135
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,680
I had this faint memory of how I was so happy.

136
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,200
Day.

137
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,560
Can you help me recall this memory?

138
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,760
Let’s see if it’s actually as good as I can remember it.

139
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,600
Of course.

140
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
Slow down.

141
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,220
Hey, what’s this dish?

142
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,540
It looks like stir-fried bamboo shoots, but it’s not.

143
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,340
Hm! This is good.

144
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,660
- Is it good?
- Hm!

145
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,920
The lady chef told me it is awesome.

146
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,560
It’s a spicy rice called ...

147
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,560
Je... Je... Je...

148
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,560
- Jenko.
- Yes, P’Day! Jenko.

149
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Jenko spicy rice, a local Karen dish.

150
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,880
The lady said this is good.

151
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,480
Is it weird that I can remember?

152
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,740
I’m from Kanchanaburi.

153
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,580
I was born here.

154
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,820
Telling you just in case you forgot.

155
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:35,220
Does P’Day actually own a famous barbershop here in Kanchanaburi?

156
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, he gave me this cut.

157
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,000
Looks good, right?

158
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,280
Aw.

159
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,340
If we pay a visit, would P’Day cut our hair himself?

160
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,000
No.

161
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,680
He only cut VIP clients’ hair.

162
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
Hm.

163
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,420
Does that mean P’Itt is a VIP?

164
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,420
Hm!

165
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:13,320
But P’Day doesn’t look like someone who owns a barbershop.

166
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,960
- Yeah, he looks more like someone who works with racecars.
- Exactly.

167
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,440
I can see that.

168
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,080
Talking about cars, that’s P’Itt’s expertise.

169
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,560
- His family owns a car repair shop.
- Really?

170
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,640
Day works there too.

171
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,440
If anyone would like a new set of car stereos,

172
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,240
pay a visit to Pradubyon Charoen.

173
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,760
Tell the staff you’re my friend, and we’ll discount you.

174
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,520
- Wow!
- Thank you.

175
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,240
That’s great. And once you’ve got your new stereo set

176
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,360
and you want to hit the track, tell me.

177
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
- Of course?
- You meant your track?

178
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
No, no.

179
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,640
Day is a partner of it with another friend, Nan.

180
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,460
P’Day, do you race sometimes?

181
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,620
You’re going to drive fast again, right?

182
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,300
Day.

183
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,980
Yeah,

184
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,420
I’m not.

185
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,780
And don’t you turn off your phone on me again.

186
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,900
You make me worried.

187
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,500
Gear told me to!

188
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,860
Itt!

189
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,140
You’re going to make me get drowned again.

190
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,720
What would you do if my Night became a widow?

191
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,680
Aw.

192
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,360
I’ll find him a new boyfriend.

193
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,800
A top-grade one.

194
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,520
No, P’Itt.

195
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,720
- Aw.
- They love each other.

196
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Hm!

197
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,200
They’re teasing each other.

198
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,480
- (Laughing)
- They’re cuddling.

199
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,680
(Laughing)

200
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,240
(Chuckling)

201
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,280
Isn’t that enough?

202
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,760
Everyone! Let’s eat.

203
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,400
- Give me youtiao.
- Let’s have some Jenko.

204
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,960
Let’s share.

205
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,560
Have you got a spoon?

206
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,280
- We do.
- Go nuts.

207
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,760
- Sure thing.
- We’ll eat it all.

208
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
- Day!
- What?

209
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,020
Cramp?

210
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,660
Cramp!

211
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,840
Yeah.

212
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,240
Aw! Argh!

213
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,640
Gently.

214
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,800
Ah!

215
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,720
Aw.

216
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,600
A cramp like this isn’t too serious.

217
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,780
I am happy that we both have and care for each other.

218
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
Right there.

219
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,620
Getting better?

220
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,660
That’s enough.

221
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,840
I’m getting better. Can I go swimming?

222
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,800
- No way.
- What?

223
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,200
Your leg was just cramped, and your face is all pale.

224
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Come on, Day.

225
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,640
I want to.

226
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,640
I don’t come here too often. Day? Please?

227
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,520
Please.

228
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,120
Fine. Whatever.

229
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,720
You’re the cutest!

230
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,700
But you will come when I call you.

231
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,620
I know.

232
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,140
See you in a bit.

233
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,140
- If you don’t, I’ll drag you out of the water myself.
- What?

234
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,620
I’ll drag you out of the water myself.

235
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,760
You are the cutest.

236
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,040
Did you get better?

237
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Be careful!

238
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,920
Gear.

239
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,580
Hello?

240
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
Hello?

241
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,000
Ahem.

242
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,680
If you’re not going to say anything, hang up.

243
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,960
It’s annoying.

244
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,240
(Chuckling)

245
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,780
The last time I checked, I called Itt.

246
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,660
Why did you pick up the call?

247
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,060
Day.

248
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,220
How did you know me?

249
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,620
(Laughing)

250
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,100
(Laughing)

251
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,180
You can’t really remember me, huh?

252
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,160
Day.

253
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,060
Say what you want to say. Stop stalling.

254
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,100
You are annoying.

255
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,260
Day!

256
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,400
I’m coming for you two!

257
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,140
I will do it.

258
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,940
(Laughing)

259
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,040
(Laughing)

260
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,080
(Laughing)

261
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,520
Hey!

262
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,640
Let’s have lunch over there.

263
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,960
What’s up? Day.

264
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,300
The strange call that doesn’t talk.

265
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,620
Is it this number?

266
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,540
Yeah, this number.

267
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,180
I talked to him.

268
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,760
What about it?

269
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,240
He said he’s coming for me

270
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,900
and he’ll do something.

271
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,060
He also asked me

272
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,900
if I can remember him.

273
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,220
Then ...

274
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,160
That means he knows us.

275
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,200
So,

276
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,920
what’s his voice sound like?

277
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,300
I had it recorded. Listen.

278
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,380
You can’t really remember me, huh? Day.

279
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,020
That’s P’s voice. It’s definitely him.

280
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,320
Day, what’s wrong?

281
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Day, are you alright?

282
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,140
Day?

283
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,460
Day?

284
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
How come you get a headache like this?

285
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,800
Day.

286
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,800
Is he alright?

287
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,460
Day! No!

288
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,980
Die!
