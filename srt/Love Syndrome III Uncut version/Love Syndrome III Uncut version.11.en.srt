1
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,360
What is this?

2
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,360
Get off!

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,720
Get off!

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,320
This is my revenge.

5
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,720
What revenge?

6
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,000
You hit my car!

7
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,840
Do you remember Night?

8
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,560
And do you remember your horrible friend, Gear,

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
and what he did to my brother?

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,520
That idea came from you.

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,400
- Get off of me!
- You will pay.

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,440
Argh!

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,240
How is it possible?

14
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
With such a horrible start,

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,640
how can we become lovers?

16
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,040
Before today,

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,600
it has been rough.

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,840
We’ve been through a lot.

19
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,320
But you ...

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
You forgot everything.

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,800
You need to remember everything
to understand all this.

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,520
I don’t think I want to now.

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,800
I heard people say how I never let you do anything.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,400
There were only a few things you allowed me to do.

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,280
I watered the plants every morning.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,640
I sometimes helped you wash our car.

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
We drove to work at my dad’s repair shop.

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,240
Once we arrived,

29
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
you took care of all the papers.

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,720
And I helped with the mechanical jobs.

31
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,040
At lunchtime,

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,560
we sometimes had food made by my mom.

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,600
If not, we ate out somewhere.

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,640
But actually, you preferred to cook for me.

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,720
You went grocery shopping and cooked yourself.

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,280
I just waited for the food.

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,480
That was how we spent our lives every day.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,960
We repeated it over and over,

39
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,880
but I was so happy

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,280
to spend all my time with you.

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,240
All of it, with you.

42
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,920
No matter how repetitive it is,

43
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,040
I’ll do it again

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,560
if it’s you.

45
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,120
Right now,

46
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,240
I miss those moments so much.

47
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,480
When ...

48
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,320
When can we go back to that life?

49
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,640
Meal’s ready.

50
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,960
I’m not hungry.

51
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,960
You need to eat.
Otherwise, you’ll get a stomachache.

52
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
Where’s Dad?

53
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,880
He’s running some errands.

54
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,520
Does he know that I’m home alone?

55
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
Yeah.

56
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,480
He prohibited you from leaving.

57
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,320
But I ...

58
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,120
Where do you want to go?

59
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,320
Meeting a friend.

60
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
A friend?

61
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,280
Which friend?

62
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,080
I don’t know what problems you two are facing,

63
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,600
but I don’t want you to be sarcastic to him.

64
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,840
It’s not a big deal.

65
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
Day has been moody lately,

66
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,560
so he went home to cool down.
We didn’t want to fight.

67
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,920
That’s how it was before he lost his memories.

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,880
You know that.

69
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,320
Are you sure?

70
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,200
Yes.

71
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,360
Fine, but don’t come home late.

72
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,400
If Dad’s angry, I can’t help you.

73
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
Hm?

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
Yea, Mom.

75
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,560
Thank you, Mom.

76
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
Go.
Wait a minute.

77
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
I think you should eat first.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
- Mom.
- Please?

79
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,760
I’m really not hungry.

80
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,440
I’ll return quickly to eat your food.

81
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay, fine.

82
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,040
Nan! Get off of me!

83
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Get off!

84
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,760
Don’t move!

85
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,000
This is the punishment for your defeat.

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,880
Nan! No!

87
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,560
Whoa!

88
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
What’s up? Itt.

89
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Are you going to faint at my track again?

90
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Hey!

91
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,800
Go get me food.

92
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
You can starve to death.

93
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
Move!

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,080
And ...

95
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
where’s Day?

96
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
I came alone.

97
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
Are you two good?

98
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,920
Do you still have that video of Mac?

99
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,440
Why?

100
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,760
I thought we were done.

101
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,880
Day said Nan let you go free.

102
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,320
Of course.

103
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,560
He then dragged me back.

104
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,080
These people won’t ever let me go free.

105
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,400
They did this as revenge for you!

106
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,360
Nan.

107
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
Day told you to let him go.

108
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,680
You even said you wouldn’t do anything to him.

109
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
Itt, please.

110
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,800
I know what I’m doing.

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Haven’t you deleted that video?

112
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,600
The video you threatened him with?

113
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
Why do you care?

114
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,800
This is the time to laugh at him rather than to forgive.

115
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,600
If we couldn’t forgive others,

116
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,000
all the horrible things we did to each other would’ve landed us in jail.

117
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,440
And me?

118
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
You left me to rot.

119
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Are you happy now?

120
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,760
If you don’t want it to come back and haunt you two,

121
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,840
get rid of it.

122
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,560
What happened?

123
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,960
Tell me.

124
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
Nothing.

125
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,360
I just don’t want you two to have any trouble.

126
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,600
We’re fighting.

127
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
We’re separated now.

128
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,200
He said he wanted to be alone.

129
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,600
Day? Want to be alone?

130
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,680
- Hey! Nan.
- Just go home.

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,080
Nan,

132
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,560
trust me.

133
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
Delete that video.

134
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,920
How can I?

135
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,400
It doesn’t even exist.

136
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,400
Huh?

137
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,760
Yeah, I fooled him.

138
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Hm.

139
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,400
Do you feel better now?
Let’s go home.

140
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,320
Does Mac know this?

141
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,400
Come on.

142
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,040
I’ll find time to tell him.

143
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,560
- When?
- Itt?

144
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
- I will.
- When?

145
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,200
You leave for now.
I’ll tell him soon.

146
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,640
Just head home.
Go.

147
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
- When are you going to tell him?
- I will soon.

148
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,840
- Don’t forget that.
- Yeah.

149
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,680
If you don’t tell him,

150
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,640
- Do not forget!
- Yeah!

151
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,400
- Tell him!
- Yeah!

152
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,280
You’re late.

153
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,840
Why are you here?

154
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,600
I wanted to talk to you at the racetrack,

155
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,280
but there were some annoying people in the way.

156
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,840
So, I drove to meet you here,

157
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,760
but I didn’t plan that you’d drive that slowly.

158
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,840
Are you insane?

159
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,560
Cut to the chase.

160
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,640
What do you want?

161
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,720
Tomorrow, I will settle everything with Day.

162
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
Don’t be fooled twice.

163
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,640
If someone says I’m in danger, do not believe them.

164
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,120
If something bad happens, escape to the safest location.

165
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
Do not solo anything.

166
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,320
All these just to lecture me?

167
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,760
Am I supposed to be delighted?

168
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
Itt.

169
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
If you really are in danger,

170
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
I can’t leave you.

171
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,480
Care about yourself before caring about me.

172
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,480
This is our mutual agreement.

173
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,880
Day, I won’t accept this.

174
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,520
Do not wait for me. Do not waste any time.

175
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,560
You need to escape to where there are lots of people.

176
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,880
If you see his car, drive faster.

177
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,480
Don’t try that.

178
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,240
That won’t work.

179
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
I’m not that stupid to use the same trick.

180
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,920
If I want to kidnap you, I could do that right now.

181
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,280
So?

182
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,640
I just informed you so maybe you’d come.

183
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,240
Going or not, what does that have to do with you?

184
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,720
I just want you to see him under my feet.

185
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,440
See him pray for life.

186
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,000
See him all defeated.

187
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,960
Are you a kid?

188
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,080
Seriously.

189
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,840
Are you happy?

190
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,200
Does this resentment make you happy?

191
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,240
All you think about is winning or losing.

192
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Are you happy?

193
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,520
You love to lecture just like Day does.

194
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,480
That’s my business.

195
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,280
You don’t have to come.

196
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
I’ll record a video for you.

197
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,400
Screw you!

198
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,480
Don’t ever come back!

199
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,920
I’m sorry.

200
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,320
Screw you!

201
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
Get off of me!

202
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,160
What is wrong with you?

203
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,160
Do you want to die that badly?

204
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,120
Do you know what you just did?

205
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,360
Dammit!

206
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,760
Boss, boss.

207
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Boss, boss.

208
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,720
What?

209
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,040
Are you with us?

210
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,920
What?

211
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,040
With a face like that, you’re not with us.

212
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
- How about a drink?
- A drink!

213
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,520
What? Are you looking for free drinks?

214
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,800
What kind of person do you think I am?

215
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,840
Freeloader.

216
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
You can just disrespect me outright if that’s what you think.

217
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,720
- You said it yourself, freeloader!
- Oh!

218
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,920
So harsh.

219
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Sure, I’d like to drink.

220
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,400
- Yeah!
- Yes!

221
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,360
Let’s go!

222
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
What do you mean?

223
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,160
The bars haven’t opened yet!

224
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,120
Bast!

225
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,920
Let’s get to work first. Go!

226
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,000
Both of you. Follow me.

227
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,520
Right away.

228
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,280
Honey.

229
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,200
Don’t let Itt go anywhere today.

230
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,240
Is everything alright?

231
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,600
I’ll tell you later.

232
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,040
No matter what. Keep him at home.

233
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,120
I’ll be running some errands.

234
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,040
- I’ll be back late.
- Okay.

235
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,000
Bast, check everything here.

236
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,480
Those down there too.

237
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,560
- Yes.
- Did you see that?

238
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,480
- The old man left!
- What?

239
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
Where is Dad going?

240
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,440
Why do you care?

241
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,600
- Let’s get some drinks!
- Let’s get a drink, Boss!

242
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,560
What did you say?

243
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,560
(Chuckling)

244
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,600
We saw that your son is a bit stressed out

245
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,640
so we’re taking him out to decompress.

246
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,600
Right.

247
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,480
I allow you to leave early today.

248
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,160
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

249
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,040
- But Itt, you’re not going anywhere.
- What?

250
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,800
Why?

251
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,520
Dad asked that you don’t leave home today.

252
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,160
- Cheers!
- Yeah.

253
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,080
Drink some!

254
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,320
Boss, can we have a fun song?

255
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,440
Just one.

256
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
He plays. You dance.

257
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,680
Cheers!

258
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,200
(Singing)

259
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,920
Normally, shouldn’t we let him have fun?

260
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,280
It doesn’t matter if our hearts are at the bar.

261
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,560
That’s all that is counted.

262
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,840
Yeah!

263
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,680
Woo!

264
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,440
I’m having so much fun!

265
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,000
Let’s have a toast!

266
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,040
- Cheers!
- This is awesome.

267
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,840
- Woo!
- Hey!

268
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,800
Be quiet!

269
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
I’m meeting Day at 8 PM tonight.

270
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,480
And?

271
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,320
Your tone tells me you don’t believe me.

272
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,640
Once he arrived,

273
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,320
I’ll call you so you can hear.

274
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,840
Wait,

275
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,840
or should I video call you?

276
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,840
(Laughing)

277
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,720
It’ll be late by the time he arrives.

278
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,760
I am more than free today!

279
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,920
I’ll send you the location

280
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,480
just in case you want to see it for yourself.

281
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,920
You’re not fooling me, P.

282
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,040
I’m so drunk!

283
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,920
I am not drunk!

284
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,840
Thep!

285
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,960
Thep?

286
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,280
The ...

287
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,440
Who are you, lady?
Why are you here?

288
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,360
Thep!

289
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,840
Where is Itt?

290
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,600
K’Itt?

291
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,160
He is gone!
(Laughing)

292
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,200
Gone? To where?

293
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,920
No idea.
(Laughing)

294
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
What?

295
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,880
Thank you so much!

296
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,560
Take this.

297
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,840
Boss,

298
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,520
do you want me to hit him?

299
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,280
Stay out. Stay here.
Be the lookout.
