1
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,760
Woo!

2
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,400
Woo! Woo!

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,200
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

4
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,880
Yeah!

5
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,240
Woo!

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
Woo!

7
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,880
Thank you, everyone.

8
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Welcome to Day’s Cast-Off Party!

9
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,120
Woo!

10
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Thank you so much, everyone.

11
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,840
Where’s his cast?

12
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,840
Give me his cast!

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,040
Give me that!

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,080
Almost dropped it!

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Let’s do this again.
Let’s go.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,320
Welcome again to Day’s Cast-Off Party!

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Since it’s his Cast-Off Party,

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,560
our theme today is Taking Off!

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,040
- Yeah!
- If you haven’t taken anything off, look at your friends

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
and take their garments off!

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Take it all off!

22
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,160
So, if you’re still wearing a shirt, take it off!

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Let’s go!

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,840
You there! Take it off.

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
Take it off quickly!

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,120
Yes! You! You haven’t taken anything off!

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,400
Wait, don’t people normally sign on a cast?

28
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,320
Right, give me a moment, everyone.

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,680
I’ll have these guys sign the cast.

30
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,480
Take it away!

31
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,320
Yeah!

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,960
Sign it and leave some space for me too!

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Everyone, this party couldn’t have come to life ...

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,880
So, now that everyone has taken something off,

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
I can’t let you all be cold.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,960
I’ll have these five on stage take off their shirts too!

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,640
Let’s start with the first.

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,080
- So, to start things off, take it off!
- Yeah!

39
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,560
Three, two, one!

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,800
Woo!

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
Yeah.

42
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,840
Hey, hey, hey.

43
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,200
The upper part of you guys is revealed already.

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,440
How about we go down there?

45
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,200
Aw, aw! Alright!

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,880
Hold your horses!

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,120
Let’s take the jacket off first!
Three, two, one!

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,320
- Take it off!
- Woo!

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Woo!

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah.

51
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,120
Slow down!
Your turn.

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,680
You’re all sweaty.

53
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,960
Me too.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
Just kidding!

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,600
It’s your turn to take it off now!

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,000
Three, two, one!
Give him some noise!

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,040
Whoa!

58
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
- Why aren’t you taking it off too?
- You’ll have to do that for me.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,080
- I guess I’m taking my scarf off.
- Aw.

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,120
Okay! Keep that for me!

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,360
Make some noise to see those two up there take off their jackets!

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
Woo!

63
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Whoa!

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Everyone, wait.

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,560
One, two, three, four, five, six.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,320
Where’s our friend?

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,960
Where’s my friend, Itt?

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,400
He’s our special guest!

69
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,360
Has anybody seen Itt?

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,240
Itt! My friend!

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,760
He’s over there. Everyone, make him some noise!

72
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,280
He’s looking great today!

73
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
- It’s rare seeing you like this.
- You look nice!

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,880
Wow!

75
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,920
This is a special night, everyone.

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,080
I'm your big fan!

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,760
I guess I’m coming down now.

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,640
Everyone, let’s go and party!

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
Yeah!

80
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,800
Go, go, go!

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,640
You’re late.

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,600
- Better than never.
- Let’s celebrate! Yeah!

83
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,360
- Cheers!
- Woo!

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,120
- I’m tipsy.
- Are you?

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
I don’t know what being drunk is.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,760
Hey!

87
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,200
- Why are you so weak?
- You tell him!

88
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
- You tell him!
- Why so?

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,600
- That’s too much!
- It’s once in a while!

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,400
Why? I don’t do this too often.

91
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,600
This is the Cast-Off Party.

92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,360
If they aren’t taking my shirt off, do you want me to do that myself?

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,120
Stop it. Stop acting naughty.

94
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
If not me, would you do it?

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,320
Fine. I’ll take something off mine.

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,920
He really took it off!

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,360
What about down there?

99
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
- That’s enough.
- Hahaha.

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,680
Okay! Nill took his jacket off.

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,480
Who’s next?

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,880
Hey, Night.

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Do I have to?

104
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
- Of course! Everyone’s doing it.
- Night doesn’t have to.

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,440
I’ll take something off instead of him. Two pieces.

106
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Hey!

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
- You want to get started?
- What are you taking off?

108
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,640
Let’s see!

109
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,480
I’m doing it. I’m a man of my word.

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
- Stand up to your words.
- I do!

111
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,280
- One more!
- Take it off!

112
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,720
- What about one more?
- Upper piece?

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,160
Why not something down there?

114
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,640
- That’s enough.
- I prefer an upper piece.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,560
- Take it off!
- Yeah!

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,960
- You’ll get cold.
- I took something off.

117
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,920
- You’ll get cold.
- What about you, you, and you?

118
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,000
What? I already took off my scarf!

119
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,680
Itt hasn’t taken anything off.

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
Hm?

121
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,120
Itt, you dressed so well,

122
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,520
Day’s going to be on high alert tonight.

123
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,440
I mean your mind is going to be bright. Why give me that look?

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,920
Fine, I’m not mentioning that anymore. He looks pissed.

125
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,200
I don’t think having Itt take things off himself will be fun.

126
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Day.

127
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,440
Decide what to take off from Itt.

128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,360
Nick! You!

129
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Take it off. Take it off!

130
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,560
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

132
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,720
Here he comes!

133
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,720
Whoa!

134
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
- Whoa!
- Day!

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
They’re really doing it!

136
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,320
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

137
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,040
- Hey!
- Is he really doing this?

138
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,680
What about the button?

139
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,760
How about his zippers?

140
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
- Hey!
- Huh?

141
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,120
That’s it?

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
This is my party.

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Don’t think you could be so charming to everyone.

144
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,440
Wait, you’ve taken something off.

145
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,440
You, you, and you also have.

146
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,520
Nan?

147
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
Nan!

148
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,120
You have to stand out by taking something off!

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,720
I’m taking something off with my special guest.

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,280
What? Nice bracelets, though.

151
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,040
What does it read? Nan and ... What?

152
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,360
That’s my guest.

153
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,640
There.

154
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,880
I took something off. He took something off. Fits the theme nicely.

155
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Mac?

156
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,920
Why are you still with Nan?

157
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,440
You dare to ask?

158
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,680
Guess who made me stuck here.

159
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,760
Guess who made me do this.

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,160
And you.

161
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,280
How should I deal with you?

162
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,800
Agh!

163
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
What is this?

164
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,560
Let me go!

165
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,520
Nan.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,080
He caused trouble in your territory.

167
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,840
Deal with him however you want.

168
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,240
Let me go!

169
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,760
I thought we were done.

170
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,840
Day said Nan let you go free.

171
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,280
Of course.

172
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,520
He then dragged me back.

173
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,040
These people won’t ever let me go free.

174
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,320
They did this as revenge for you!

175
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,280
Nan.

176
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
Day told you to let him go.

177
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
You even said you wouldn’t do anything to him.

178
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,800
Itt, please.

179
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
I know what I’m doing.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Haven’t you deleted that video?

181
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,600
The video you threatened him with?

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
Why do you care?

183
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,760
This is the time to laugh at him rather than to forgive.

184
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,560
If we couldn’t forgive others,

185
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,000
all the horrible things we did to each other would’ve landed us in jail.

186
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,480
What do you mean by us? I’m not in this.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
And me?

188
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,440
You left me to rot.

189
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,400
Are you happy now?

190
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
Are you happy now?

191
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,880
Day!

192
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,000
Argh!

193
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,360
Didn’t I tell you?

194
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,040
You can only look at Itt being with Day.

195
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
You are not to mess with them again.

196
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,240
Itt!

197
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,720
You must help me.

198
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
Help? Help what?

199
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
You were throwing tantrums at him, and now you’re asking him for help?

200
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,760
- I want to go home, Itt!
- What’s so bad with my house?

201
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,040
You wanted to race; I let you use my racetrack

202
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Goddamit!

203
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,560
What do you want from me?

204
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,040
- Let’s go!
- Itt!

205
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,680
- You dared mess with him?
- This is because of you!

206
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,360
Itt! You’re getting me out of this!

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,720
- P’Day.
- Let get back to our table. Let’s go.

208
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
You’re seeing things!

209
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,720
Let’s drink some more beer.

210
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,640
Everyone, everything is fine. Let’s party!

211
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,240
Let’s party!

212
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,760
DJ, play music!

213
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
- Let’s party! Everything’s cool.
- Music!

214
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,840
We’re out of this drink.
Let’s try this.

215
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,080
Let’s go.

216
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Who’s that guy with Nan?

217
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,240
Did you mean Mac?

218
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,880
Do you know him?

219
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,480
He’s an old friend from high school.

220
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,120
We didn’t like each other.

221
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,280
What’s up with him and Nan?

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
And with me too.

223
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,920
He was having a problem with me, and Nan helped.

224
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,160
What is this problem?

225
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,000
It’s something, but that’s the past.

226
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,640
It looks like an unfinished business.

227
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
It’s kind of.

228
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,120
Am I a part of this?

229
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,720
He looked at me like he wanted a fight.

230
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,800
Well, you’re my boyfriend

231
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and Nan’s boss.

232
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
- Correct.
- Right?

233
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,080
That’s right.

234
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,680
That’s right.

235
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,080
Is that everything?

236
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,960
That’s really it.

237
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,040
Hey, you don’t need to mind them.

238
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,520
This party everyone organized for you

239
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,280
is to make you happy.
Is that right, everyone?

240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,200
- Right, Nick?
- Exactly.

241
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,400
- You don’t see Itt in this attire often.
- Yeah.

242
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,400
We all try to make your days the best.

243
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,800
- See? I hired these models and DJ for a hefty price!
- Wait, wait.

244
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,240
- What?
- I think you did that for yourself.

245
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,680
What are you talking about? I have no idea.

246
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,320
- What’s for me?
- Don’t lie to me.

247
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,040
I love the music. I’m going to the front.

248
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,960
- Wait! Nick!
- Yeah!

249
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Let’s go!

250
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,520
Hey!

251
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,120
Thank you. We meet again.

252
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,680
I never thought a guy like you would be played like that.

253
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,160
It’s not like that.

254
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I understand him.

255
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,000
He’s a son of a mistress.

256
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,120
That’s why he wants people to love and care about him a lot.

257
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,360
That’s why he likes to make me jealous.

258
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
Wow, can I see some moves?

259
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,600
I need to get someone back.

260
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,920
Wait for me here.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,960
Nick!

262
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,400
Get down from there.

263
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,840
- What?
- What are you doing?

264
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,960
- I’m not coming down!
- You’re not?

265
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,000
Come get me yourself!

266
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,400
Don’t think too hard about it.

267
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,880
Yeah, let’s have a toast.

268
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,840
Come, let’s go.

269
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,280
Let’s go bottoms up.

270
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,320
- Bottoms up.
- Itt.

271
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
Itt.

272
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,480
Now that you drank,

273
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,320
how about a smile? Smile?

274
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Smile.

275
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,520
P’Day, how about a smile?
You don’t seem entertained.

276
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,360
- A smile.
- A smile, yeah?

277
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,200
- You gotta have fun!
- You look good when you smile.

278
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,520
Yeah!

279
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,000
- You look great nonetheless.
- You tell him.

280
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,280
A toast!

281
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,480
Are we sleeping in this room?

282
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,520
Yeah.

283
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,040
I guess you’re tired.

284
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,880
Go take a shower.

285
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,840
I’ll prepare your medication.

286
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,600
Ouch!

287
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,160
Day.

288
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,760
I ...

289
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Let me help.

290
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,840
Give me a second. I’ll get you a towel.

291
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,320
Can you stand up?

292
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,000
I’m good.

293
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,160
Day,

294
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,800
do you see me as a lover or a property?

295
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,480
Time to wake up.

296
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,680
Wake up.

297
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,920
Not waking up?

298
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,960
- Hm!
- Morning kiss.

299
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,680
Alright, I’m up. I’m up.

300
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,200
- Itt.
- Hm?

301
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,120
Are you sure?

302
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,120
I’m up.

303
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,320
Something is up.

304
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,320
Something is.

305
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,600
Day, I want to have cake from P’Nam’s bakery.

306
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,640
Day, do you know what day today is?

307
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,240
I’m not feeling well.

308
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,080
Please come back to take care of me.

309
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,360
I feel so lonely.

310
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,680
You need to come back and tell me what to do.

311
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,240
It’s been so many days.

312
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,600
It’s so lonely.

313
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,720
Argh!

314
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,520
Day!

315
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
What happened?

316
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,360
- A headache.
- I’ll grab the pills.

317
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,440
- Ugh!
- Aw!

318
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,200
Be careful!

319
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,680
Day, come take your medicine.

320
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,160
Where did the headache come from?

321
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,480
Forget it.
