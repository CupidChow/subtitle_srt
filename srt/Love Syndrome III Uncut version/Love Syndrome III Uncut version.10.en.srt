1
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,600
Day, we still don’t know where P is.

2
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,860
Is it a good idea to eat outside?

3
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,520
What if we don’t find him in a year? Don’t we want to live our lives?

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
You said you wanted to come here.

5
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
Here we are.

6
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,260
Hopefully, you’ll be happier.

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,400
- I know, but ...
- Hm.

8
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,560
Smile.

9
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,320
Fine! I’ll eat as much as I can today.

10
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,540
I’m not letting him steal my happiness.

11
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,720
Uh.

12
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,680
I’ll go to the toilet.

13
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,760
Pick a seat. I’ll see you.

14
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,100
Hurry.

15
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,840
Come out.

16
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,100
A smelling skill of a dog as always, Day.

17
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,220
And you?

18
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,500
Have you changed?

19
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Why don’t you ask Itt how much I have changed?

20
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,680
Damn you!

21
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,660
I’m getting tired

22
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,840
of a coward dog like you.

23
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,040
Ah! No!

24
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,280
Oh, I forgot that you lose your memory.

25
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,880
Stop beating around the bush.

26
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,660
What do you want?

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
I’m just missing Itt.

28
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,260
We used to talk and used to be friends.

29
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,760
Don’t you remember that?

30
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,520
What you’re doing is called being a pervert.

31
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,160
Do you know ...

32
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,780
that I have lots of fun plans for you two?

33
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,480
Just thinking about it is making me so happy.

34
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,160
Imagine actually doing it.

35
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
How fun is that going to be?

36
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,100
Why don’t you do it now?

37
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,480
You’re all talk.

38
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,740
If I were you, I’ll return to Itt immediately.

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Day.

40
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,100
What do you want to have?
I’ll order for you.

41
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,720
You’re my boyfriend.
You should know what I like.

42
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,600
Sure, I’ll order for you.

43
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,480
Tada! I ordered your favorites.

44
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
You know me too well.

45
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,460
When you were kidnapped by P,

46
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,080
how did it happen?

47
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,840
I doubt you’re that weak.

48
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
He knew my weakness.

49
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
He used you as a bait,

50
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,060
saying that he had kidnapped you.

51
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,740
I was stupid enough to follow him.

52
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,460
And you had to rescue me.

53
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,560
You just didn’t know.

54
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,680
Now you do.

55
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,060
Don’t be fooled twice.

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,760
If someone says I’m in danger, do not believe them.

57
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,620
If something bad happens, escape to the safest location.

58
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,440
Do not solo anything.

59
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,640
All these just to lecture me?

60
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,180
Am I supposed to be delight?

61
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Itt.

62
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
If you really are in danger,

63
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,460
I can’t leave you.

64
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,080
Care about yourself before caring about me.

65
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,260
This is our mutual agreement.

66
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,140
Day, I won’t accept this.

67
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,780
Do not wait for me. Do not waste any time.

68
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,780
You need to escape to where there are lots of people.

69
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,120
If you see his car, drive faster.

70
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,180
Let’s eat.

71
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,100
I want to bring you somewhere.

72
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,660
Where are you takingme?

73
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,600
A trip?

74
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,140
An amusement park?

75
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,820
You want some?

76
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,480
No, thank you.

77
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,020
Come on?

78
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,120
Here. Open your mouth.

79
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Quickly. Come on.

80
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,140
I told you I hate this.

81
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,180
If you can’t overcome your fear, your life is going to be hard.

82
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,180
Hey, Nan.

83
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,560
What’s up, Itt?

84
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,840
Back on good terms with Day?
Is that why you two came?

85
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,520
Why do you look a bit worn-out?

86
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
Hey!

87
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,400
What are you two doing around this car?

88
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,400
You know how much Itt loves cars.

89
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,740
He just want to see this beautiful car up close.

90
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
Move.

91
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,600
Mac.

92
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,640
Aren’t you going to check your engine?

93
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
Mac, isn’t it almost time to race?

94
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,280
If you’re late, you’ll lose automatically.

95
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,020
Nan! What is wrong with you?

96
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,420
Didn’t you say you let him go home?

97
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,800
I said he went home,

98
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,140
but I didn’t say he was released.

99
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,640
What do you want from him?

100
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,820
Itt, I think I want to see the race.

101
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,920
I told him that if he wins, he get a reward.

102
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,000
But if he loses, I’ll punish him.

103
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,380
What did you do to that car?

104
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,600
I just want the result to be certain.

105
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,220
Nan! What if accident happens?

106
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,020
Did you think this through?

107
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,580
Itt.

108
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
Let’s give it a go.

109
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,920
Tell me if you feel uncomfortable.

110
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,280
Nan.

111
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,420
Is that a professional racer in that car?

112
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,260
Yes, Boss.

113
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,020
Nan, you put him against a professional racer
and you still sabotaged his car?.

114
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,520
What?

115
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,440
Ask him what he did.

116
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Hey?

117
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,600
What’s happening?

118
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,600
Come on! Go!

119
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,480
Come on!

120
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,280
What is this?

121
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,600
- Here.
- What?

122
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,140
You drive.

123
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,640
No.

124
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,380
- Drive.
- No!

125
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,200
Drive!

126
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,900
No! You drive.

127
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,820
If not now, then when?

128
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,000
I’m afraid of driving. You drive!

129
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,960
You drive.

130
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,500
How about this? If you’re afraid to drive,

131
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,540
you sit next to me.

132
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,580
That’s what you did on our way back from Kanchanaburi.

133
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,580
Fine, you drive.

134
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,400
Okay. Got it.

135
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,660
- You drive.
- You drive!

136
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,680
Come on!

137
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,940
[Three years ago.]

138
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,280
Whose car is that?

139
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,020
What are you doing?
Get out of the car!

140
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,160
Didn’t you see where you were going?

141
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,240
- Didn’t you see me coming out?
- Please calm down.

142
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,040
I’m so sorry.

143
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,340
Don’t worry about a thing. I’ll deal with everything.

144
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,120
I’m not going anywhere.

145
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,660
I’m so sorry.

146
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,140
I had just started driving a few days ago.

147
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,220
How will you pay for this?

148
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,320
- Where’s the damage? I’ll ...
- Don’t you see?

149
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,040
I’ll deal with everything.

150
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,820
I’m not going anywhere.
Everything will be dealt with.

151
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,860
I am so sorry.

152
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,660
Look at this.

153
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,680
I hit your car?

154
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
Itt?

155
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Itt.

156
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,840
Itt!

157
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,980
Itt!

158
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,560
Itt! Wake up!

159
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,480
Itt!

160
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,060
Itt? Itt. Wake up!

161
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,400
Itt. Itt!

162
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,880
Wake up! Itt!

163
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,020
Itt, wake up.

164
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,480
Itt.

165
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Itt!

166
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,800
Wake up!

167
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Yes.

168
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,580
Yes, I see.

169
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,560
Okay. Thank you.

170
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,060
I talked to Dr.Kong from psychiatry.

171
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,440
What about it?

172
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,460
The condition you have

173
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,720
is called a panic attack.

174
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,920
Without proper treatment,

175
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,120
It could be fatal.

176
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,660
Don’t do this again, Day.

177
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
I’m sorry.

178
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,620
How long have you been experiencing this?

179
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,880
I remember you were a biker?

180
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,740
Well,

181
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,860
after Day got into the hospital,

182
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,360
I feel uneasy riding a fast vehicle.

183
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,540
It must’ve been traumatic.

184
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Yes.

185
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,200
It’s alright.

186
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,480
The doctor has prescribed you antipanic medication.

187
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,500
Nurse,

188
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,540
please follow up on N’Itt’s medication.

189
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,960
Sure.

190
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,120
All in all,

191
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,460
you need to undergo continuous treatment,

192
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,880
take your medicine regularly,

193
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,680
and attend mental therapy.

194
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,220
Do not stop taking drugs on your own.

195
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,140
Yes, uncle.

196
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,360
Mental support is just as important too.

197
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,420
Wow!

198
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,660
You act like you’ve never had a cake.

199
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,260
I always act this way.

200
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,960
Thank you for treating me to this.

201
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,160
That’s just my way of saying sorry

202
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,120
for almost driving you fatally shocked.

203
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,760
Don’t be too happy.

204
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,260
P’Day and N’Itt, I miss you!

205
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,360
How are you? P’Day.

206
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,080
I’m sorry I didn’t visit you.

207
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,940
I was so occupied at the bakery.

208
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,180
It’s alright.

209
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,500
My body has recovered.

210
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,220
Uh, and ...

211
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,900
I still can’t remember much.

212
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,560
How about you have a seat?

213
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,380
Your favorite table is free.

214
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,360
Day.

215
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,100
Guess which table is our favorite.

216
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,680
P’Nam, don’t tell him.

217
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,400
What do you think? Good?

218
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,020
Yeah.

219
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,940
P’Nam, can I have a strong americano for Day, please?

220
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,420
Itt? Americano at this time?

221
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,260
How is he going to sleep tonight, then?

222
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,900
That coffee is nothing to him.

223
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,360
Of course.

224
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,520
If I couldn’t sleep because of the coffee tonight,

225
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,840
you’re staying up with me.

226
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,620
I’m going to the toilet.

227
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,720
Day.

228
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,920
Yeah!

229
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,460
I’m so glad you remember!

230
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,020
I didn’t. I just sensed it.

231
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,600
But your sense was right.

232
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,600
Do not cry.

233
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,860
P’Nam, can I please have each of your cakes?

234
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,320
Of course.

235
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,060
If you can’t finish all that, you’ll get what’s coming!

236
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,980
What if I can?

237
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,900
What am I getting?

238
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,020
Om nom nom.

239
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,860
Om nom nom nom.

240
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,980
Om nom.

241
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,400
What are you having?

242
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,720
Can I join?

243
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
P.

244
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,980
Why are you here?

245
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,380
Why so rude?

246
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,580
I’m a customer too.

247
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,340
Itt.

248
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,300
Go help P’Nam.

249
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,320
I’m not going to hurt him.

250
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,560
This is P’Nam’s café.

251
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,580
If you do anything to him,

252
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,060
you’ll eat my fist and not cake.

253
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,300
Sit down.

254
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,940
Hah!

255
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,000
Are you not going to ask me ...

256
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,420
why I’m here?

257
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,500
You told me yourself

258
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,020
that it wouldn’t be fun if you told me.

259
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,740
Yeah.

260
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,480
That’s true.
I said that.

261
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,200
I just want to know if you two

262
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,540
are happy.

263
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,420
What do you think?

264
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,460
I want you two to suffer more than I did.

265
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,360
What suffering are you talking about?

266
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,400
Weren’t you the one who shot us?

267
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,020
You made my dad exile me out of the country.

268
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,740
Rich kid.

269
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,020
Committing a crime

270
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,160
and escaping abroad.

271
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,200
In fact,

272
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,580
you should be in jail.

273
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,900
I guess you don’t know ...

274
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,400
What I had to lose.

275
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,560
Now, I have changed.

276
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,800
I ...

277
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,320
will never be the same.

278
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,140
Never!
