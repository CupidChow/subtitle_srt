1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,760
Hey!

2
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,040
Hello?

3
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,840
Hello, are you Mr.Raweepon’s family member?

4
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,000
- Yes.
- We’re calling from the hospital.

5
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,120
Mr.Raweepon got into an accident.

6
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,640
He has been transferred to the hospital.

7
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,320
Hi!

8
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
We are Raweepon’s family.

9
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
Mr. Raweepon’s family?

10
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Give me a second.

11
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,880
Are you aware of his condition?

12
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,760
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.

13
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,280
They should soon contact the family.

14
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,480
And ...

15
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,600
what about his condition?

16
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,520
He’s losing a lot of blood.

17
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,280
His lungs collapsed.

18
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,920
He has head injuries,

19
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,520
a broken arm,

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
and a dislocated leg.

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,800
He’s still in the ICU.

22
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,040
- Hey! Itt! Itt!
- Itt!

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,080
- Itt!
- Please!

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,200
Please get out of the way.

25
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,080
- Wake up.
- Please move out.

26
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,760
Wake up, Itt!

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,680
Please move out of the way.

28
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,720
[One year ago.]

29
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,680
You’re like a kid.

30
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,560
Hey, didn’t you promise me you wouldn’t be harsh on me?

31
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,920
I promised I wouldn’t be harsh in the way you don’t like,

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,760
but you like this one.

33
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,160
Anyhow,

34
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,640
you’re responsible for this.

35
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
Here I am.

36
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,560
You wanted to eat cake,  so I bought cake.

37
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,200
I want to take a shower,

38
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,080
but I can’t get up.

39
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I’ll take you to it.

40
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,880
But ...

41
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,280
keep quiet.

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,400
Hm.

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,600
What’s your plan today?

44
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,720
Today?

45
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,320
Work in the barbershop.

46
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,440
So, you’re touching customers' hair again?

47
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,400
I am a barber!

48
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,360
Visit me more often.

49
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,280
Feeling lonely?

50
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
Not now,

51
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,680
but I could be soon.

52
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,360
So ...

53
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,880
how about staying in the room downstairs?

54
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,360
No way.

55
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,760
J’Bale is going to make fun of me.

56
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
What are you ashamed of?

57
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,960
I’m not like you.

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Call me if you need anything.

59
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,080
Hm.

60
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Visit me more often.

61
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

62
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,120
Ready for a shower?

63
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,080
Carry me there.

64
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,040
Let’s take a shower.

65
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
Take a shower!

66
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,280
You’re not taking a shower with water.

67
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,440
Day!

68
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,760
I’m not satisfied yet.

69
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,200
What a pervert!

70
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,480
Take me to the shower!

71
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,640
Here we go!

72
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,760
Mom.

73
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,520
P'Day is the only family member I have left.

74
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,720
I lost my parents in a car accident.

75
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,200
And now my brother too?

76
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
And a car accident?

77
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
Night.

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,040
It's my fault.

80
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,760
It's my fault, Night.

81
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,760
Your fault? Why?

82
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,600
I told him to rush his way back.

83
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
That’s why he drove fast and what led to this.

84
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,440
P'Itt.

85
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,440
We’re still unsure

86
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,600
if it happened because he was driving too fast.

87
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,400
If I hadn't rushed him,

88
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,640
he would’ve stayed overnight with Dad in Chonburi.

89
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,240
This wouldn’t have happened.

90
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,760
Night,

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,560
I am sorry. I’m so sorry.

92
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,760
I hurt you again.

93
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,800
We are done with the past.

94
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Our story in the past

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
is to be buried.

96
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Mom and Dad always remind me of this.

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
If I’m too childish,

98
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
I’ll lose him someday.

99
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
Itt.

100
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,480
Day could be fine.

101
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,960
Being pessimistic isn’t the best thing you can do now.

102
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,080
Let’s be optimistic for Day.

103
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
Hm? Itt.

104
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
You too, Night.

105
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Hey.

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,240
Dad dealt with everything.

107
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,200
He talked to uncle Ruengrit.

108
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,200
Dr.Ruengrit is a director at this hospital.

109
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
Mom.

110
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,440
Can you bring me to Day?

111
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,920
Itt.

112
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,240
I think you should wait here.

113
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
You’re not in great shape.

114
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,000
Waiting at the operating room won’t do you any good.

115
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,200
If P’Day sees this,

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,520
he would want you to rest.

117
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,520
He loves you.

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
I’m sure that ...

119
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,400
he’s fighting for his life.

120
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,120
P’Day does not give up easily.

121
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,600
Hm? Let’s rest for now.

122
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,720
Don’t think too hard.

123
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,440
He’s losing a lot of blood

124
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,320
due to heavy concussions.

125
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,320
His right arm bone was broken.

126
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
So was his right leg bone.

127
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,520
But the most concerning issue ...

128
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,080
is how his head took an extremely heavy concussion.

129
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
His brain is bleeding,

130
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,840
and some parts of his brain were bruised.

131
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
We must treat him very closely.

132
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
So, he has to be admitted to the ICU for now.

133
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,840
Don't worry.

134
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,960
The medical team will take care of him as best as we can.

135
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you so much, doctor.

136
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,960
“There’s nothing to worry about”?

137
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,080
What does that mean?

138
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,760
He’s in the ICU!

139
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,520
Nick.

140
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,840
Take me there.

141
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,520
And it has to be me specifically?

142
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
- Well, you’re my friend.
- Gear is your friend too!

143
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,360
Or did you realize everyone else won’t let you?

144
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
Is that why it has to be me?

145
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,240
Itt, you're in a bed yourself,

146
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,960
and the ICU doesn't let anyone in.

147
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,880
Even if you could go, you could only knock on the window.

148
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,880
You’re going to stick your face on a window like a suckerfish.

149
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,760
Seeing him from outside is enough.

150
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,040
Please bring me there.

151
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,480
- Nick!

152
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,040
Why did you say that?

153
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,680
Let's try it again

154
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,160
Itt, you're in a bed.

155
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
You should take care of yourself first,

156
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,200
so that once he leaves the ICU,

157
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
you can take care of him then.

158
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Yes, P'Nick is right.

159
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,840
- Well, I'll do it myself.
- Hey, hey, hey!

160
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,840
Itt!

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,120
Stop being such a child and listen to others!

162
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,840
Exactly!

163
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,880
I'm spoiled

164
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,840
That’s why Day is suffering.

165
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,200
Goddammit!

166
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,320
Why did this happen?

167
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
Calm down, P’Itt.

168
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,280
Don’t be like this.

169
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,880
Hey, Itt.

170
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,880
I meant no offense to you.

171
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,680
You’re right, Gear.

172
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,200
I should rest,

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
so I can get back to taking care of him.

174
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,600
Can you adjust my bed?

175
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,520
Why so moody?

176
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
Are you on your period?

177
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,600
What?

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
Careful.

179
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,080
Slowly.

180
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,880
Itt, you can see him from the outside.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
You just recovered.

182
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,440
Why did you say he's fine?

183
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,960
P'Day is okay right now.

184
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,480
Why hasn’t he woken up?

185
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,320
And what’s with all the tubes?

186
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,240
What are they?

187
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,760
How much is he suffering from?

188
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,280
What does he have to go through?

189
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,000
He's just sleeping.

190
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,720
In a few days,

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,360
he will be moved to a normal room.

192
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Just a few days to go.

193
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,720
He will wake up.

194
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
Only a few days.

195
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,200
Then we’ll go home.

196
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,000
Just a few days.

197
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,000
Be patient.

198
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,920
Please come out soon.

199
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,440
Everything is alright.

200
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
Day is out of the ICU.

201
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,680
He recovered rather quickly.

202
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,160
But why is he still unconscious?

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,880
This is normal.

204
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,560
Similar cases took patients months to regain consciousness.

205
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,640
Oh.

206
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't want him to be unconscious for that long.

207
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
P'Arthit, how do you plan to take care of him?

208
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll take care of him.

209
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,480
Hm, Itt.

210
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,320
He has a broken arm and leg.

211
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,920
You know nothing about this.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,960
I think hiring a specialized nurse to care for him is better.

213
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Let a nurse take care of him.

214
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,440
Then, you can learn from the nurses.

215
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,200
Sure, I’ll do anything to take care of him.

216
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,400
Dr. Rueang, please arrange this for me.

217
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,760
Of course.

218
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,600
This is how to wipe a patient’s body.

219
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,960
Give me a second.

220
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,400
We’ll start with his arms.

221
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,120
You need to be especially careful.

222
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,280
since that’s where the injury occurred.

223
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,960
We’ll wipe his arm from top to bottom.

224
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,960
- You can flip his arms around, but be careful.
- Yes.

225
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,680
Also, wipe his palm.

226
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,640
For his face,

227
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,840
you need to change to a new cloth and wipe gently.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Okay.

229
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,440
Hey! Itt, my friend!

230
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,120
Here I am!

231
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,280
We’re visiting!

232
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,440
How are you?

233
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,680
Did you bring Nill with you?

234
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,680
You saw him too?

235
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,440
What?

236
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,680
When I was away,

237
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,640
was he flirty with doctors around here?

238
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,920
What?

239
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,400
Are you feeling paranoid?

240
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,720
I’m sorry to make you feel that way

241
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
because I'm way too attractive.

242
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Nill, have you visited Day?

243
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,320
I have.

244
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Right.

245
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,800
This is for you!

246
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,000
A carer for a gift.

247
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,920
Oh! I meant a gift for a carer.

248
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,520
You need to eat!

249
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,320
That’s a gift for a carer for you.

250
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
Oh, that’s a lot of them.

251
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,920
Yes! To help you fight through this with Day!

252
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,520
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

253
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,320
Isn’t your father something, having him in a VIP room?

254
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
Awesome.

255
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,560
I'm very surprised

256
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
In the beginning,

257
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,680
it seemed like Dad won’t accept him.

258
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
But now, he's like his other son.

259
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
He helped with my dad’s work,

260
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
unlike me

261
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,920
who is pretty much useless.

262
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,520
Don’t think of it like that.

263
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,600
It’s because of Day loving you

264
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,560
that made your dad loves him too.

265
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,760
Your dad even helped with the aftermath of this accident.

266
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,840
Hey, Nill.

267
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,280
Is his car in your garage?

268
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
What is its condition?

269
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
From the look of it,

270
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,120
don’t bother to fix it.

271
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,400
Just buy a new one.

272
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,360
- Nick!
- What?

273
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,160
The car was as good as scrap.

274
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,360
I never thought that the accident was this serious.

275
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,240
He probably has to endure so much pain.

276
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,440
- Don’t worry.
- Don’t blame yourself.

277
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,960
Hey!

278
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
You don’t look too good.

279
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,240
Nan, long time no see.

280
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Well, It's been a long time since you and Day last visited my racetrack.

281
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,000
And also,

282
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,840
I don't have much time these days.

283
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
I'm in love.

284
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,840
Well,

285
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
you probably don't have time to care about me.

286
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Forget it.

287
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,720
Juniors at the racetrack would like to visit him too.

288
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,400
Please don’t bring them here.

289
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,080
It’s going to cause a scene at the hospital.

290
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,520
Hey! What?

291
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,440
If you weren’t Nill’s boyfriend,

292
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,200
I’d have kicked you in the mouth.

293
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,760
- I’m going to return the favor!
- Hey, hey! Shorty. Chill.

294
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,880
Nick.

295
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
This is a hospital.

296
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,560
Hey, Itt.

297
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,200
They want me to tell you to not worry

298
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,520
because their Boss, Day, is a die-hard.

299
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,440
Here.v

300
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,000
I bought something for you.

301
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,760
I thought you might like it.

302
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Cake?

303
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,960
[One year ago.]

304
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,200
Day.

305
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,080
Day.

306
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,320
Bring me to the bakery tomorrow, please.

307
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,440
Hm.

308
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,800
Day.

309
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,200
What?

310
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
I’m sleepy.

311
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,000
Then go to sleep.

312
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,640
Why are you here?

313
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,960
Sleep upstairs with me.

314
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,880
I don’t want to sleep alone.

315
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,840
Please.

316
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,560
If you’re not coming, I’ll sleep here.

317
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
God!

318
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,880
Why would you sleep here? It’s cold!

319
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,040
You’re going to get sick.

320
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,040
Why are you not coming with me?

321
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,480
Have you stopped being moody?

322
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,200
I have.

323
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
Sure?

324
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,120
Of course.

325
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,480
Right, let’s go upstairs.

326
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,360
You’re coming, right?

327
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,600
Ah-huh.

328
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,160
How’s your headache?

329
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,360
Well,

330
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,280
it should get better soon.

331
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,320
Tomorrow should be fine.

332
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,320
Take me to P’Nam’s bakery tomorrow.

333
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,160
Promise?

334
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Yeah.

335
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,680
Pinky promise.

336
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,760
You’re so cute.

337
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Let me give you a massage.

338
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,760
Why?

339
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,000
What's wrong?

340
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,280
Nan, why didn’t you discuss this with us first?

341
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,240
This is a cake!

342
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,840
Itt asked Day to buy a cake for him.

343
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
That’s why he got into an accident.

344
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
He doesn’t need to be reminded.

345
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Nick.

346
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,360
That’s what you’re doing too.

347
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,400
Wasn't he hospitalized because someone cut into his lane?

348
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,480
Take your cake with you.

349
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,040
It's okay.

350
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,000
I can take it.

351
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
Enough.

352
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,520
This bakery doesn’t make the best cakes anyway.

353
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,000
- I can take it.
- No.

354
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,160
Itt, don't blame yourself.

355
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,160
It’s not like you flipped his car over.

356
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,520
Enough.

357
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,320
What? Did I say something wrong?

358
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,760
Enough.

359
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,760
Day,

360
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,320
I feel so lonely.

361
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,760
I haven’t heard your fierce voice for days.

362
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,400
It feels so lonely.

363
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,720
I’ll let you say mean things to me as much as you want if you wake up.

364
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,280
You have always been taking care of me.

365
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,760
After this, I'll take care of you too.

366
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,680
Please wake up soon.

367
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,040
If you don't wake up,

368
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,200
I’ll meet Meen and Ball for real this time.

369
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,800
Please wake up, my jelly boy.

370
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,640
Day.

371
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,240
You heard me? Day?

372
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,280
Day.

373
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,760
Are you waking up?

374
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,080

Day.

378
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
You’re kidding, right?

379
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,360
Do I look like your friend?

Answer my questions, or I’ll punch your mouth.

387
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,200
I'm Itt, your boyfriend.

You’re angry because of what I’ve done to you, right?

409
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,840
What are you on about?
