1
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,140
I’ll make you believe that I am yours only.

2
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,300
I’ve never done this with anyone.

3
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,620
You will be my first and my last.

4
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,460
Itt.

5
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,740
Wake up.

6
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,020
Night made you porridge.

7
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,580
Come have breakfast

8
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,820
so you can take your medicine.

9
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,980
Day.

10
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,500
Can you please feed me?

11
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,680
Don’t you have a hand?

12
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,480
Fine.

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,240
Alright, fine.

14
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,740
I’ll do it.

15
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,280
You took care of me before when I was recovering.

16
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,720
I can eat by myself.

17
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,280
Don’t be picky.

18
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,980
Just do what I tell you.

19
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,040
I’m sick right now; you need to come and take care of me!

20
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,980
Didn’t you say you’ll always be there for me?

21
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,740
During all the time we’ve been together,

22
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,000
you always care for me when I fall sick.

23
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,120
I want to see you.

24
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,660
Day, please.

25
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,900
What the hell is wrong with you?

26
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,200
Why did you start crying out of nowhere?

27
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,560
Why are you crying?

28
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,580
Nothing.

29
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,160
God!

30
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,200
Night will complain again about how I’m being too hard on you!

31
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,860
Hurry up.

32
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
You need to take your medicine.

33
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,020
Day.

34
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,580
Please put a mattress over there for tonight.

35
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,200
Why?

36
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,480
I’ll sleep over there tonight.

37
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,640
I don’t want you to get sick because of me.

38
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,540
We slept together last night.

39
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,220
Does it look like I’m sick?

40
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,640
Just take your medicine and rest.

41
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,520
I want you to stop babbling.

42
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,260
Aw.

43
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,440
Where’s Day?

44
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,820
Asking about him as you’re waking up?

45
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,240
What happened to “Hello”?

46
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,860
- What?
- Duh.

47
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,780
P’Day isn’t home.

48
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,660
Where did he go?

49
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,020
He went out with Nill.

50
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,940
No idea where they went. I’m not that nosey.

51
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,240
I actually asked, though.

52
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,340
It went like this.

53
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,960
“Day, where are you going?”

54
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,060
And then he said,

55
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,880
“Hey! Don’t be nosey!”

56
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,360
And I was like ...

57
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,020
I had no idea what to make of that.

58
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,100
Is that so?

59
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,100
P’Itt, please have some porridge.

60
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,680
But I just ate.

61
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,220
You slept for a long time. It’s evening now.

62
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,860
Just eat.

63
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,980
You need to move sometimes, or you might get bedsores.

64
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,640
Can I not eat?

65
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
- I’m still ...
- You have to eat.

66
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,220
You need to have your meal before you can take your medicine.

67
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Speaking of the devil. Why don’t you feed him?

68
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,380
It’s alright. He can eat by himself.

69
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,540
Yeah, Night.

70
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,120
I can take care of myself.

71
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,320
Eat more.

72
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,920
I can’t.

73
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,340
If you want him to eat more, then feed him yourself!

74
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Go! Jeez!

75
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,700
Eat more.

76
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,820
Don’t you want to recover?

77
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,200
I can’t swallow any more food.

78
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,220
Nill.

79
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,500
Bring it in.

80
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,480
Orange cake?

81
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,360
Day bought this for you.

82
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,200
Take it out.

83
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,580
Baa.

84
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,940
Stop joking around.

85
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,860
Quite playing.

86
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,400
Day? You remember?

87
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,660
I don’t.

88
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Then why did you buy it?

89
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,440
Just because.

90
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,860
- But ...
- If it’s too much of an issue for you, don’t eat it.

91
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,580
Are you going to eat your cake? I’ll happily take it.

92
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,280
Hey!

93
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,880
Let me feed you.

94
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
It’s so good!

95
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,640
Are you eating or crying? Make up your mind!

96
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,820
- You gotta watch your mouth!
- Hey, hey, hey!

97
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,420
Night, is there anything for us in the kitchen?

98
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,960
I’m not going! I’m having this cake here!

99
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,180
- Go.
- Give me that orange cake! Argh!

100
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
More.

101
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,380
More. Quickly.

102
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,620
Alright, fine.

103
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,560
Hmm.

104
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,180
Hey, hey, hey!

105
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,060
Get up and sit straight.

106
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,200
You’re going to get heartburn.

107
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,060
Hey!

108
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,400
What are you looking at me for?

109
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,300
I don’t want you to drive a race car.

110
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,160
How about we make a deal?

111
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,960
You need to stop eating orange cakes.

112
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,660
Sure!

113
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,080
Despite it being my most favorite thing in the world, I'll do it.

114
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,580
Why?

115
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,740
You love me that bad?

116
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,400
Yes.

117
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,460
I love you so much

118
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,120
just like how you love me.

119
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,960
But I’m being so terrible to you.

120
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,820
And you still love me?

121
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,600
It’s only because you can’t remember.

122
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,460
Everything will go back to normal if you can remember.

123
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,960
And ...

124
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,480
what if that never happens?

125
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,580
I’ll make you love me again.

126
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,520
Quite a confidence you have there.

127
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,620
I learned from Nick that you’re sick. I was quite worried.

128
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,280
This shorty.

129
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,660
Nick was overly dramatic. Don’t worry too much.

130
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,000
It is my pleasure.

131
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,620
Oh,

132
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,560
I bought you some sore throat lozenges.

133
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,260
Thank you.

134
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,120
Day.

135
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,520
Don’t you know that these tablets contain antibiotics?

136
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,660
Uh.

137
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,700
It’s going to cause drug resistance.

138
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,440
I wasn’t aware of this.

139
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,840
I’m sorry.

140
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,900
Don’t think too hard about it. Thank you anyway for your gift.

141
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,320
Don’t worry. It’s my pleasure.

142
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,160
We’re friends.

143
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,940
Yes.

144
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,020
I noticed that P’Day just had his cast removed.

145
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,780
How’s your condition?

146
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,400
Fine.

147
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,000
He has to occasionally move his arms and legs since he hasn’t moved them for so long.

148
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,520
I guess he still has limb weakness?

149
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,900
No,

150
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,560
I could beat someone up pretty easily right now.

151
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,980
Day.

152
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,400
Ugh.

153
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,240
It’s time for Itt to take his medicine and rest.

154
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,940
You can just go home.

155
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,980
You’re looking at me.
You’ve got a problem?

156
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,960
I don’t.

157
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,260
I just don’t see why you did that.

158
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,780
This is my house.

159
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,280
I choose who stays in my house.

160
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,240
Drink this.

161
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,540
It’s better than the lozenge.

162
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,820
Day.

163
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,040
Did you make me lime and honey syrup?

164
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,360
Night.

165
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,820
Have you seen Itt?

166
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,260
Why are you out here? Have you recovered?

167
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,580
I’m fine.

168
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,260
You once told me yourself to water these plants every day.

169
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,340
Since I lost my memory, you don’t need to anymore.

170
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,140
I can’t bother to take care of you if you fall sick again.

171
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,620
I heard people say how I never let you do anything.

172
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,560
There were only a few things you allowed me to do.

173
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,960
I watered the plants every morning.

174
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,300
I sometimes helped you wash our car.

175
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,060
We drove to work at my dad’s repair shop.

176
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,880
Once we arrived,

177
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,800
you took care of all the papers.

178
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,280
And I helped with the mechanical jobs.

179
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,540
At lunchtime,

180
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,620
we sometimes had food made by my mom.

181
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,620
If not, we ate out somewhere.

182
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,620
But actually, you preferred to cook for me.

183
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,720
You went grocery shopping and cooked yourself.

184
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,320
I just waited for the food.

185
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,420
If we didn’t go to my dad’s repair shop

186
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,840
and you didn’t take me anywhere,

187
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,440
we’d stayed home watching movies.

188
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,580
If not, we would go to your barbershop at Kanchanaburi.

189
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,060
That was how we spent our lives every day.

190
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,580
We repeated it over and over,

191
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,500
but I was so happy

192
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,980
to spend all my time with you.

193
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,120
No matter how repetitive it is,

194
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,880
I’ll do it again

195
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,420
if it’s you.

196
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,940
Right now,

197
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I miss those moments so much.

198
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,880
When ...

199
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,080
When can we go back to that life?

200
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,720
Stop, stop, stop!

201
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,160
- Jeez!
- What?

202
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,540
Can you drive faster?

203
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,440
We can take our time.
We don’t have to rush.

204
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,300
- I’ll take the wheel!
- No, no, no, no!

205
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,240
- I will drive!
- I will!

206
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,160
God!

207
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
Whatever.

208
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,600
I’m about to doze off.

209
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,320
Hm.

210
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,120
Jeez!

211
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,760
What’s with your driving?

212
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,660
It normally takes me two hours to drive from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi,

213
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,720
but it took you over four hours?

214
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,500
Day, let me help.

215
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,340
You just had your cast removed.

216
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,640
I’m good. Didn’t you just get well yourself?

217
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,180
- Nah.
- N’Day! N’Itt!

218
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,660
Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?

219
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,460
Do you know how much I miss you two?

220
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:41,720
This place isn’t just the same without you two!

221
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,260
And look at you two coming here without a heads-up.

222
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,280
That calls for a celebration! Hahaha!

223
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,000
Let’s have a Thai barbecue!

224
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,100
Kids! We’re having a Thai barbecue today!

225
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,940
Don’t rush home today

226
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,400
and close early.

227
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,020
We’re going to need to for some grilling!

228
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,720
Would that be alright with you?

229
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,940
I haven’t said anything.

230
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,420
I’ll go to the market with you.

231
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,060
Huh!

232
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,540
You’re coming to the market with us?

233
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,340
That is A-OK!

234
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,880
I’ll put the luggage inside.

235
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,280
Of course, make yourself at home.

236
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,720
Same old room, cleaned and ready,

237
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,000
waiting for you two!

238
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,100
Can you walk?

239
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,600
- I’m alright.
- Okay.

240
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Be careful, very careful. Okay.

241
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,300
Okay, okay. Oh!

242
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,760
Hello?

243
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,400
Hello.
