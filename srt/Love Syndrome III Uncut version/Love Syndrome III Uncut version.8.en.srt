1
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,640
I’ve arrived.

2
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
How’s Day?

3
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,780
He’s home.

4
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,300
Once he knew you were nowhere to be found,

5
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,040
he just went ballistic.

6
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,220
He said you got tired of him for his condition and ran away.

7
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,460
Itt,

8
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,300
don’t think too hard about it.

9
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,280
Day has been a blamer since forever.

10
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,060
Once he calms down,

11
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,220
he should realize where to find you.

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,740
I haven’t picked up many of his calls.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Turn it off.

14
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,180
The harder it is to get in touch with you,

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,840
the crazier he gets.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,840
That’ll get him to think hard.

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,320
I’m afraid he might be stressed out by me not answering his calls.

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,360
Itt!

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,000
You care about him, but does he care about you?

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,360
This time, you’ll know for sure

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,320
because if he can find you, then that means he cares.

22
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,220
What if he never comes?

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,160
Find a new boyfriend.

24
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
You met Ball last time.

25
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,980
I think finding a new one this time wouldn’t be so hard.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Gear!

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,040
Listen.

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,780
If he’s still the old Day,

29
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
he will find you.

30
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,100
Right.

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,680
I’ll turn off my phone.

32
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,340
I’ll call you if I’ve got anything.

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,300
Do not pick up his calls. Stay strong.

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Stay safe there.

35
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,820
Look over there.

36
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,460
Hey!

37
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,400
I see fish!

38
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,820
- Where is it?
- There!

39
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,260
- You like it?
- Of course.

40
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,920
You meant the fish?

41
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,140
- Hey!
- Hm?

42
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,360
Look up.

43
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,940
- What?
- Right there.

44
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,000
What?

45
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,260
What is this?

46
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,620
Happy birthday.

47
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,960
Couple rings?

48
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,540
With our names on them?

49
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
Hey!

50
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
What is wrong with you?

51
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,220
Do you want to die that badly?

52
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,140
Do you know what you just did?

53
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,920
I see.

54
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,240
You don’t remember

55
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,000
that you said you’ll never lay your hands on me.

56
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
Where is Itt?

57
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,280
Somewhere without a hot-tempered guy like you!

58
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,260
You think this is a joke?

59
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,180
Find that out yourself!

60
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,960
If you can’t think of where he is,

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,120
you’re not worthy of seeing him.

62
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,600
- Argh!
- Screw you! Get off of me!

63
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,860
He can never leave me!

64
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,960
You can’t remember him!

65
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,280
You insult him. You hit him.

66
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,260
He doesn’t need to put up with someone like you.

67
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
He can leave you at any moment.

68
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,760
Damn you!

69
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,260
Get off of me!

70
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,500
- Screw you!
- Get off!

71
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,340
P’Day!

72
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,100
P’Day! Enough!

73
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,100
Gear!

74
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,300
Gear!

75
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,320
Where is Itt?

76
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,780
- I’m asking you a question!
- We’ll tell you!

77
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,440
Screw you, Day!

78
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,940
Were you trying to kill me?

79
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,120
Are you alright?

80
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,900
Hey.

81
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,660
What’s your name?

82
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,280
I’m Itt.

83
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,900
I’m Kung.

84
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,300
This is Tal, and that is Han.

85
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,360
Did you come alone?

86
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,860
Yes.

87
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,000
Do you want to join us?

88
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,660
Yeah.

89
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,900
- Of course.
- Yeah! Nice.

90
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,100
Let’s get down there. Han, you go first.

91
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,820
I need to take off my shirt.

92
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,280
Do we? Okay.

93
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,140
Be careful over there.

94
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,300
Night!

95
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,640
Where is he?

96
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,900
P’Itt is now at ...

97
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,000
an important site of memory ...

98
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,840
for both of you.

99
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,920
I’m not joking.

100
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,020
It’s so important ...

101
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,920
that I’m convinced ...

102
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,160
you can remember it.

103
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,560
It’s a memory of you both.

104
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,120
- Oh!
- Sorry.

105
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,560
Be careful.

106
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
It’s slippery.

107
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
Han, you’re seeing this?

108
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,000
Seize the opportunity, huh? Peace?

109
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,160
- I can’t let him fall.
- Hm!

110
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,720
It’s alright. Let’s enjoy the waterfall.

111
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,140
Let’s go.

112
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,760
So, it’s going to be like that?

113
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,500
P’Itt is now at an important site of memory for both of you.

114
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,160
It’s so important that I’m convinced you can remember it

115
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,360
It’s a memory of you both.

116
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,620
We’ll remember all the time we had together,

117
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,480
both good

118
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,000
and bad.

119
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,940
P’Itt, I ordered a spicy mushroom salad,

120
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,880
Kanchanaburi jungle curry, and a few grilled fish.

121
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,160
Can I borrow your container to get the food?

122
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,940
- Of course. Thank you.
- No worries.

123
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,520
Do you know how to cook?

124
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,060
No, but I’d like to.

125
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,940
- Ah-huh.
- But ...

126
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,340
my family won’t let me.

127
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,960
Huh? Why?

128
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,640
I burned our kitchen.

129
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,100
Sorry, it’s not possible to reach the number you dialed at the moment.

130
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,580
Sorry, it’s not possible to reach the number you dialed at the moment.

131
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,200
- P’Itt, would you like a jacket?
- Hey.

132
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,640
- It’s okay. You’ll get your jacket wet.
- It’s alright.

133
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,140
- Such nice weather.
- Ah-huh

134
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,740
How about we find some activities for tomorrow?

135
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,580
Would you like to join?

136
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,500
P’Itt?

137
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,820
P’Itt?

138
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,380
P’Itt, would you like more water?

139
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,520
Oh! I’m good.

140
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,140
There is our house.

141
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Seriously, read this.

142
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
It will be always you.

143
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,500
- What does that mean?
- It has always been you.

144
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,660
It is to be read with your heart.

145
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,740
What is this?

146
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,400
Take it.

147
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
It’s your best friend.

148
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,020
He just killed the mood.

149
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,520
Hello?

150
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,300
Did you call to ask about Itt?

151
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,240
Yeah.

152
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,060
Can you tell me?

153
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,380
I’m not telling!

154
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,460
Night told me everything.

155
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,680
Considering everything you did to my friend; you dare to cheat your way to find him?

156
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,060
I was talking to Nill.

157
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,280
I’m not letting my boyfriend tell you.

158
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,360
Nill!

159
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,320
Alright.

160
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
Well ...

161
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,660
This is not about Nick,

162
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,580
but rather more about you.

163
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,460
I want you to remember it by yourself

164
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,620
so it’s better for you.

165
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,220
Sorry.

166
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,200
If you still have no clue,

167
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
then you’re an idiot!

168
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,840
I guess I have to think of it myself?

169
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,240
Okay.

170
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,900
And for your boyfriend,

171
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,980
please kick him in the mouth for me.

172
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,440
You’re going to get hurt.

173
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,820
Huh? I’m going to get hurt?

174
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,580
Sure!

175
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,340
I’ll spark your memory!

176
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,240
- Bring it.
- Listen to this!

177
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,220
We’ll remember all the time we had together,

178
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,240
both good

179
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
and bad.

180
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,080
Okay?

181
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,040
Thank you.

182
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,900
Thank you for everything.

183
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,680
And I ...

184
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,540
thank you too

185
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,020
for everything.

186
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,400
Hey!

187
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,620
The waterfall?

188
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,680
Huai Mae Khamin Waterfall.

189
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,920
What?

190
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,020
Going to Huai Mae Khamin Waterfall at this time?

191
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,200
Look at the time!

192
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,720
Who’s going with you?

193
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,780
I just want to borrow a car. I can drive there myself.

194
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,420
Driving by yourself at night is dangerous.

195
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
Gear can drive you there tomorrow.

196
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,520
We’ll leave in the morning instead.

197
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,920
Let’s go to bed for now.

198
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,960
Alright, fine.

199
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,360
Sure.

200
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,740
We leave at 3 A.M.

201
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,140
What? 3 A.M.?

202
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,980
Day? Are you serious?

203
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,380
It’s still dark at that time!

204
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,840
Please.

205
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,540
This is for P’Itt.

206
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,560
Please?

207
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,040
Fine! 3 A.M.

208
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,640
Your brother is horrible.

209
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,280
But my Gear ...

210
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,660
is adorable.

211
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
Did you mean it?

212
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,040
Did you?

213
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,220
- What are you doing?
- We can do this in five minutes.

214
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,460
- Five minutes what?
- It’s only five minutes!

215
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,440
- Just a quicky?
- Yeah.

216
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
With a mood like this,

217
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,160
let’s tell horror stories.

218
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Good idea.

219
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,720
- I’ll start.
- Let’s go.

220
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,540
This is a true story.

221
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,420
My brother, who studied at one of the universities in the north, told me this.

222
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,260
He said that on every Buddhist Lent Day,

223
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
there will be the Red Ghost Parade.

224
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
What is that?

225
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,500
It’s a parade for ghosts at the university.

226
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,620
They organized this parade to plead for merits from shrines in the university.

227
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,100
On the day,

228
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,580
most students will return home.

229
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,940
If it’s possible for them,

230
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,080
they’ll try to avoid staying at the dormitory.

231
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,700
Most will return home.

232
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,800
My brother stayed at the dormitory.

233
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,980
He didn’t believe any of this.

234
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,780
He thought it was a story made up to play pranks on the new students,

235
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,540
the first-year students.

236
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,880
He thought nothing of it.

237
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,820
He went to bed on the day,

238
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,780
and something strange happened.

239
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,380
At midnight,

240
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,940
he heard a noise.

241
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,660
What’s the noise?

242
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,860
He heard traditional Lanna music.

243
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
The old traditional music.

244
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,260
I’m getting goosebumps.

245
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,420
He heard this from far away.

246
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,440
It’s as if there was an actual parade.

247
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
It was far away,

248
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,560
and it got closer and closer.

249
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,020
Then, he heard a knock on the door.

250
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,300
So,

251
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,800
he thought it was his roommate.

252
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
He shouted,

253
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,480
“Just come in! You already have the key!

254
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,420
Why do you need to knock?”

255
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
Then, the knocking stopped.

256
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,980
The bed next to him

257
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,180
flattened.

258
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,400
Yeah.

259
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
He thought it was his roommate lying next to him.

260
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,980
And?

261
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,680
And he said,

262
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,120
“Why did you lay next to me? Your bed is over there!

263
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,260
Go sleep on your bed!”

264
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,200
And he felt like something was coming closer

265
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,880
and closer.

266
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,160
He couldn’t take it anymore

267
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,820
so he turned to the other side to tell off his roommate.

268
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,160
- He did not find his friend.
- What?

269
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,900
- Do you know who he found?
- Who?

270
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,440
A large man

271
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,180
chained like a prisoner.

272
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,400
His entire body was bloody.

273
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,480
And worse,

274
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,020
he didn’t have a head.

275
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,160
Where is his head?

276
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,260
- Here it is!
- What are you doing?

277
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
- Hey, are you okay?
- Why did you do this?

278
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,140
Hey! Let’s stop.

279
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
We’re only scaring ourselves. Let’s do something else.

280
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,680
- Alright, let’s do something else.
- Let’s eat.

281
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,200
- I’m not telling any more stories.
- Are you okay?

282
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,920
Would you like to have this?

283
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,640
P’Itt!

284
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,440
What is it, Peace?

285
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,760
Can you sleep alone tonight?

286
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,540
You didn’t look too good when we were telling that horror story.

287
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,960
You saw that?

288
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,420
Do you need a friend tonight?

289
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Wouldn’t it be better than sleeping alone in the middle of the forest like this?

290
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,080
If you can sleep alone, then ...

291
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,500
I’m leaving.

292
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,700
Wait!

293
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,080
Yeah.

294
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,760
Sleeping with a friend is better than with a ghost.

295
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,100
I’ll go get my pillow and blanket.

296
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,580
Are you afraid of me?

297
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,060
No. Why would I?

298
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,440
Oh, it’s because I separated us with a backpack.

299
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,840
Haven’t you heard about the “Middle-Person Ghost?”

300
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
A ghost will come for someone in the middle.

301
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,320
That’s great.

302
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,820
I’m not going to do anything even though I want to.

303
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,040
Just kidding.

304
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,560
Good night.

305
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,920
Did I make the right choice?

306
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,120
Here’s his car!
