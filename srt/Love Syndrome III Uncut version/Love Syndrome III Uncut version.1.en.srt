1
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,480
Boss, there’s someone on the track!

2
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,840
Hey!

3
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,560
What is wrong with you?

4
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,560
Do you want to die that badly?

5
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,480
Do you know what you just did?

6
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
I see.

7
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,040
You don’t remember

8
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,440
that you said you’ll never lay your hands on me.

9
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
I’m sorry.

10
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,640
I’m sorry.

11
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,480
Screw you!

12
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,000
[Three months earlier.]

13
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,680
We’ve been together for over two years.

14
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Our love is a strange love

15
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,640
that started from misunderstandings,

16
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,880
deception, and resentment,

17
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,880
before turning into love

18
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,120
unlike others’.

19
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,840
Time to wake up.

20
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,880
It’s morning.

21
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,200
Wake up.

22
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,160
Not waking up?

23
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,120
- Hm!
- Morning kiss.

24
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,480
Alright, I’m up. I’m up.

25
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,200
Woo hoo!

26
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,120
What a relaxing day.

27
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Bas!

28
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,040
What are you doing?

29
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,880
It’s going to take forever to do it this way.

30
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Get out! I’ll do it myself!

31
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,560
You’re in the way!

32
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
Yes.

33
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,160
If that’s the case, then I will call you back.

34
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,640
Yes. Thank you.

35
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Day, what’s up with Itt?

36
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,240
The usual stuff.

37
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
My god! What’s with all the fuss?

38
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,000
Mom!

39
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,960
You know your son.

40
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,400
He’s probably mad at Day!

41
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Bas! Zip it!

42
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,080
You’ve been blessed by the boss today!

43
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,800
You too, P’Thep!

44
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,640
Go remove the back wheels.

45
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,960
But this car is to have its window film replaced.

46
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,680
And? I said what I said. Go!

47
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,720
Itt.

48
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,640
Mom, what did I do?

49
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,040
- Come here, son!
- Mom!

50
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,280
Here he is.

51
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,960
I brought you this childish boy here just before he could trash our customer’s car.

52
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,640
I’m not childish!

53
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,320
Bas was working too slowly this morning!

54
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Just look at him. What is he waiting around for?

55
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,920
- What is it with Day again this time?
- He broke our promise.

56
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
What promise?

57
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,080
He said he’d take me to have cakes.

58
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,760
Look at him. He’s stuck to that chair.

59
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,240
Itt.

60
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,240
Day is working.

61
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
If you’re in a hurry, how about you help him out?

62
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,160
Dad, you know I’m not good at these smart jobs.

63
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,880
I prefer hard physical work.

64
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,440
If so, then let Day do his job

65
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,520
and your cakes can wait.

66
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,080
You can’t throw tantrums every time things don’t go your way.

67
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,240
I’m telling you that this is not nice.

68
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,560
Mom!

69
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,560
I’m your real son.

70
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,840
Why are you siding with him?

71
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,320
Your mom and I are on the side of people who do the right things.

72
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,320
Keep this up, and he might one day leave you!

73
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,160
Don’t threaten me with that!

74
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,560
He’s never going to leave me!

75
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,600
What did you just say?

76
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,600
I’m sorry.

77
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,560
So?

78
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,080
Are we going or not?

79
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,680
I will once I finish my work.

80
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,760
What if the bakery closes before you do?

81
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,800
P’Nam’s bakery isn’t closing down anytime soon.

82
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,440
We still have other days.

83
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,880
I want to have my cakes today. You are definitely bringing me there today.

84
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
Day!

85
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,600
Don’t spoil him.

86
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,640
Don’t bring him anywhere.

87
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,560
He’s been spoiled very badly.

88
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,400
P’Nam, are these your new cakes?

89
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,440
Yes, these are taro cake and egg yolk thread cake.

90
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,640
I’ll take both.

91
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,600
- Of course, I’ll bring them to your table.
- Thanks.

92
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Here are your cakes.

93
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,040
There you go.

94
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,320
This is your taro cake,

95
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,520
and this is your egg yolk thread cake.

96
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,680
Wow!

97
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Hm!

98
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,800
It’s so good!
(Chuckling)

99
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,600
You’re too kind!

100
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,120
Please enjoy.

101
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,400
Day, would you like to have a bit?

102
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
It’s not too sweet.

103
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,880
Day, please.

104
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,800
Choo, choo. Here’s the train!

105
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,240
Choo, choo.

106
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,120
What do you think? Good?

107
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
Yeah.

108
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,640
P’Nam, can I have a strong americano for Day, please?

109
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,120
Itt? Americano at this time?

110
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
How is he going to sleep tonight, then?

111
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,600
That coffee is nothing to him.

112
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,040
Of course.

113
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,200
If I couldn’t sleep because of the coffee tonight,

114
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,520
you’re staying up with me.

115
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
I’m going to the toilet.

116
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,160
Day.

117
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
Excuse me.

118
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,040
I don’t know the Wi-Fi password.

119
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,160
Can you please share your hotspot for me?

120
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
I need to send a file really quickly.

121
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,680
Sure.

122
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,160
I just shared it.

123
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,760
Day, is this your friend?

124
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,520
No, he just wanted to use my hotspot.

125
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,520
Your name is Day?

126
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,560
I think the signal isn’t too bad here.

127
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,640
It works pretty well, even in the toilet.

128
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,480
I have to send a file quickly and don’t want the connection to drop.

129
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,560
Connectio ... Sorry.

130
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,040
I doubt the internet connection is that bad here.

131
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,080
Day.

132
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,360
Looks like you’ve lent both of your hands to help him.

133
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,200
I’ll feed you the cake myself.

134
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,320
Yeah.

135
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,840
I’ve finished sending my file.

136
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,360
I’ll return to my table now.

137
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,800
What did I do?

138
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,360
Your feet.

139
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,520
Keep them at bay.

140
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,720
Why?

141
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,720
Did that turn you on?

142
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,040
No, it’s your mood that keeps going up and down.

143
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,920
No, you!

144
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,440
You knew he was teasing you, and you let him.

145
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,280
We’ve been together for over two years.

146
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,120
And you still think I’m looking for someone else?

147
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,960
I’d try to see you try

148
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,920
because I would too.

149
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,400
You’re still thinking about seeing someone else?

150
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,640
Hello.

151
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,240
N ... N’Day.

152
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,440
What?

153
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,520
Yes.

154
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,600
I’ll be there tomorrow.

155
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,040
Day, what happened?

156
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,880
A thief broke into the barbershop at Kanchanaburi.

157
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,520
What?

158
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,000
Who did this? They’re as good as dead!

159
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
I’m going to deal with them.

160
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,440
N’Day and N’Itt. Here you are.

161
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
Did anyone get hurt?

162
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,960
Luckily,

163
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,160
our staff all returned home yesterday. No one stayed overnight here.

164
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,640
What’s the damage?

165
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,960
They completely ruined it!

166
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,120
The damage is as much as you can see here.

167
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,400
Our hair tools;

168
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,400
hair dryers and hair steamers. Everything is ruined.

169
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,880
They even took my iPad!

170
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,200
Day! If I knew who did this, I would beat them badly!

171
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,040
What did the police say?

172
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,280
They followed their procedure of collecting fingerprints

173
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,040
and questioning our staff,

174
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,960
as well as people who live nearby.

175
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,200
Actually, there’s this old man who lives in a blue house across the street.

176
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,360
He claimed he saw three to four teenagers break in.

177
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
These kids!

178
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,280
If we had installed CCTVs, we would’ve known where they went.

179
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,160
J’Bale, I’ll buy you back everything,

180
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,280
including your iPad.

181
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,440
Thank you so much, N’Day.

182
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,720
That’s alright.

183
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,040
It’s good everyone’s safe.

184
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,120
Day?

185
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,400
What if the police never catch them?

186
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,960
- Consider it bad luck.
- Huh?

187
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,040
Since when did you become so magnanimous?

188
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,680
Damn you!

189
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,960
I’m getting tired of a coward dog like you.

190
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,080
Ah! No!

191
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
Day could kill.

192
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
It only depends on if he wants to or not.

193
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,240
Day, what’s this?

194
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,320
Someone broke into your barbershop, and you’re still in the mood for a game of snooker?

195
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,280
You could be catching the thief instead.

196
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,920
Bank!

197
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,760
Wow! P’Day is paying my establishment a visit.

198
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,880
I guess we need a celebration.

199
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,480
- Isn’t that right? Ingfah?
- Yes.

200
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,360
- Uncle Day, Hello. I miss you.
- Aw, come here.

201
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,600
How many times have I told you

202
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,840
about bringing Ingfah here?

203
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,680
How about you play with uncle Day and uncle Itt for a while?

204
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,880
Then grandma will take you home, okay?

205
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,280
Yes, dad.

206
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Come play with uncle Itt too.

207
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,200
Do you remember me?

208
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Of course. Uncle Itt is uncle Day’s boyfriend.

209
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,920
What are we playing today?

210
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,080
- Patty cake.
- Patty cake?

211
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,200
How do I do that?

212
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,640
Bank, give me a bottle of beer.

213
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,400
- Here it is, P’Korn.
- Thanks, brother.

214
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,160
May I have a toast with you?

215
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,600
Who are you with tonight?

216
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,840
My boyfriend.

217
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
I don’t mind that.

218
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,240
I didn’t do anything.

219
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,520
I haven’t said anything.

220
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,720
Bank, was Day a player?

221
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,160
Is he going to beat me up if I disclose this?

222
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Hm! I’ll keep him away from you.

223
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,240
You can just ask me.

224
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,400
I don’t want to hear it from you.

225
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,640
So? Bank?

226
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,880
Was he a player? It depends on how you look.

227
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,920
He wasn’t flirtatious.

228
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,720
He never made the first move.

229
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,440
People always make the first move on him,

230
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,320
but he never calls any of them his boyfriend.

231
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,000
Seriously?

232
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,160
But there’s this one person who he cares so much about.

233
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,360
Night, his younger brother.

234
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,840
And then there's you, with whom he's serious about his relationship.

235
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,840
So? Was that an answer you wanted to hear?

236
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,840
Day, I’m going to the toilet.

237
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,000
When I’m back, you will teach me how to play snooker.

238
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Hey, have you sold everything?

239
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,080
I have already sold hair dryers and hair straighteners.

240
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,640
I need to jailbreak the iPad.

241
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,800
I heard that the owner is very ruthless.

242
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,840
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

243
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,480
He lives in Bangkok!

244
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,320
There were only weaklings watching over the place.

245
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Hey! Why are you filming us?

246
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,080
So, it’s you who broke into my barbershop. You’re dead!

247
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,360
Get him!

248
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,760
Damn bullies!

249
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,520
Get him!

250
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,000
Very good!

251
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Don’t worry about them. I know these teens.

252
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,840
I’ll deal with them.

253
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,000
More beer?

254
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,960
Please don’t give me that fierce look. Come on.

255
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Hey!

256
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,840
Just say what’s on your mind!

257
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,960
I helped you catch the thieves. What are you mad at me for?

258
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,920
Was it so hard to just come and tell me about them?

259
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,880
Why did you start the fight yourself?

260
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,840
And what if I took the time to tell you about them, and they escaped?

261
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,320
We would’ve missed our chance.

262
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
I know that you want to catch them,

263
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,960
but did you forget to think about yourself?

264
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,760
What if things went wrong?

265
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,800
I can buy back objects,

266
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,800
but you ...

267
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,600
I can’t buy another you.
