1
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,440
Why does rubbing Day’s body take so long?

2
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,040
Day wanted to wash his hair.

3
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,680
P'Day.

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,800
Do you think we should go to a temple?

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
We’ve been having a hard time recently.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,560
A temple?

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,800
Night.

8
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,320
Do you think Day is ready for that?

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,560
Yeah, I’m going.

10
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,680
What?

11
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,360
Make up your mind!

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,320
Hey!

13
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
What’s with the blackout?

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,920
I turned it off.

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
A horror movie should be watched in the dark.

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Your hair is perfectly dry.

17
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll go upstairs.

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,400
Give me a leg massage.

19
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm thirsty.

20
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Grab me a drink.

21
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
You’re teasing him.

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,560
So?

23
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,560
Right, I totally forgot.

24
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,360
Your past self loves to tease
people you’re interested in.

25
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,440
Itt!

26
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
Itt!

27
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
What a chicken.

28
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,560
It’s just a cat.

29
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,120
A cat made you scream your heart out?

30
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,560
Day!

31
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
How did you even come here?

32
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
You felt scared because of the movie, didn't you?

33
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Yeah! I’m scared. You knew it

34
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,160
Know what? I don’t remember anything.

35
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
You jerk!

36
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,840
You don’t need to remember that!

37
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,640
You only just learned about it, and you played him!

38
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,240
Don't help him.

39
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,960
Have him do it himself.

40
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
Do you know how to do anything at all?

41
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,360
You can’t even cook.

42
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,360
How am I even your boyfriend?

43
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,760
Day, you jerk!

44
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,040
You can't talk to him like that.

45
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,720
It’s you ...

46
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,040
who spoiled him.

47
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,360
You always did everything for him.

48
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,400
He’s at the point where he can’t live without you.

49
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,240
I intend to groom him into getting used to being overly spoiled.

50
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Whenever he needs something, he thinks about me.

51
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,560
You made him so that he can’t live without you?

52
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,440
My god!

53
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,520
Someone like me ...

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
will do anything

55
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,240
to make him mine and mine only.

56
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,520
You only have yourself to blame.

57
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,360
Now that I heard it myself,

58
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,440
I don’t want to go back to my old memories at all.

59
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,200
P'Day.

60
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,720
Night,

61
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,560
I need a shower.

62
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,280
Please help me clean this mess.

63
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
P'Day

64
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,120
Why did you have to hurt P’Itt like that?

65
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,280
You dare stand up to me?

66
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,440
Of course.

67
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,360
Only with someone as mean as you.

68
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,600
I’m mean? What about it?

69
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,720
If he loves me, then he should be able to bear me.

70
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,200
If not, how did our relationship last for almost two years?

71
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,760
Before you lose your memory,

72
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
you weren't this person.

73
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
If you can't remember,

74
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,080
why don’t you ask everyone?

75
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Everyone!

76
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,920
Why are you here?

77
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
Why don’t you go back to your home?

78
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,080
Wherever Night is, I’m always there.

79
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
You sleep with my brother?

80
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,520
We’ve been in a long relationship.

81
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,200
If Night were a girl,

82
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,760
you would’ve been an uncle.

83
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,680
P'Day, I'm a grown-up.

84
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm not the high school boy you believe I was.

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,840
In fact, you already knew about this.

86
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,520
Fine.

87
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,560
But during my watch,

88
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,360
don’t even think of crossing the line, Gear.

89
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,080
I can't guarantee

90
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,560
if I might accidentally hurt you or not.

91
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,480
With a single hand,

92
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,960
I think I can dodge it.

93
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,080
Hey!

94
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,560
Night, you'd better go to sleep.

95
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,640
Take Gear with you too.

96
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,760
I'll take care of Day.

97
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,440
Did you cry upstairs?

98
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,520
Don't tell me you haven't cried.

99
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,360
If you don't want me to cry,

100
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,760
you should stop talking to me that way.

101
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,320
Sensitive boy, huh?

102
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,920
The feelings of someone who lost their memory and someone who has been forgotten

103
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,600
are vastly different.

104
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
And you can’t bear that?

105
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
No,

106
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
I can.

107
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,480
I’m your soulmate.

108
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,600
Do whatever your heart tells you to do.

109
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,600
I will accept it.

110
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,520
Just go to sleep. It's late.

111
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,080
You’ll embarrass me in front of the monks with this.

112
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,960
I’m not wearing it!

113
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,600
P'Day, how about wearing this at the party tonight?

114
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,480
Do you really want me to wear it that badly?

115
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,920
P’Itt design these couple shirts for yourselves, right?

116
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,080
Yes,

117
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,280
it was his birthday gift

118
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,040
in the first year of our relationship.

119
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,160
P’Day!

120
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,160
Day!

121
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
Day?

122
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,000
Night, we'd better take him to the hospital.

123
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm fine. It’s nothing.

124
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,080
Day, let's go for a check-up.

125
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I said I am fine!

126
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,960
P’Itt design these couple shirts for yourselves, right?

127
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,720
it was his birthday gift in the first year of our relationship.

128
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,120
This way, please.

129
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,880
May you have a long life, bright skin, happiness, and good health.

130
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,360
This accident

131
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,200
is the result of your past karma.

132
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
Don’t blame this on anything,

133
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,120
thinking it is someone’s fault.

134
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,400
The more you think about it, the more pain you bear.

135
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,280
At this moment,

136
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,960
the karma has not diminished.

137
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Be patient.

138
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,120
Soon enough,

139
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,400
everything will get better.

140
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,760
That’s a big fish.
Very big.

141
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,560
Your shirt says, “naughty boyfriend.”

142
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,520
Are you naughty to me?

143
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,000
I guess just a bit.

144
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,280
When the venerable monk told us

145
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,520
to not blame this on anyone,

146
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,760
what does it mean?

147
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,760
The venerable monk referred to the person who cut you off.

148
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,160
The venerable monk probably hopes that you won’t feel resentment toward them.

149
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,320
Is that so?

150
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,520
I’m still mad, but Kamol cleared it up.

151
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,080
Do you think that was everyone?

152
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,680
Day,

153
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,320
when you crashed,

154
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,800
you were an ordinary person, not a mafia.

155
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,360
There was nothing mysterious about it.

156
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,400
Don't think too much about it.

157
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,800
But when I came out of a coma,

158
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,560
someone told me this.

159
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,800
Who are you?

160
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,600
Day.

161
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,280
I'm Itt, your boyfriend.

162
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,000
What boyfriend are you talking about?

163
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,200
Day.

164
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,680
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,920
You’re angry because of what I’ve done to you, right?

166
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,120
Day.

167
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm going to tell you everything.

168
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,960
I can't stand it anymore.

169
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,840
That night,

170
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,920
I asked you to hurriedly return from Chonburi

171
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,320
despite a heavy rain

172
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,800
just to buy me a cake.

173
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,880
Day, you need to come back right now!

174
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,360
Itt, I had Night told you that I’ll stay overnight at Chonburi.

175
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,040
And your promise? Are you breaking it again?

176
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,320
Before thinking about cakes,

177
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,120
listen to your voice.

178
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,680
Have you taken your medicine?

179
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,200
- I want to have cakes

180
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,880
or I won’t take my medicine!

181
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Itt.

182
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,000
You know that I hate it when you harm yourself to get what you want.

183
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,280
What are you going to do?

184
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,920
If you want me to stop, come do that yourself.

185
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,160
I’m not taking these medications! I’m throwing them in the trash!

186
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,560
Itt! I’m on the job!

187
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,320
I’m sick! You’re supposed to take care of me!

188
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,800
Didn’t you say you’ll always take care of me?

189
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,920
It’s just one day.

190
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
Can’t you take care of yourself?

191
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,440
Then what’s your purpose?

192
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,680
I am on the job! It’s about to rain too.

193
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,480
Even if I decide to return,

194
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,080
I wouldn’t be back in time before the bakery closes.

195
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,560
In time or not, you are coming back!

196
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,280
You need to come back and take me to the bakery.

197
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,280
I’m not backing down!

198
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,320
Itt!

199
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,160
I don’t care!

200
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,520
If you’re not coming back, then don’t come back ever!

201
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,000
Screw you!

202
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,680
Is this it?

203
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,800
The love everyone told me you have for me?

204
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,000
Ultimately,

205
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,280
it’s only about you.

206
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,320
Give me a second.

207
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,120
Hello?

208
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,840
How's everything?

209
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,480
We’re home now.

210
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,680
I’m sorry I didn't pay you guys a visit.

211
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,600
It’s alright. Knowing that you’re concerned is good enough.

212
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
Well ...

213
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,960
Can I pay you a visit at home?

214
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,000
No, please. I don’t want to bother you.

215
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,600
Who is it?

216
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,560
Meen. She’d like to pay Day a visit.

217
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,800
Tell her to come.

218
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,320
Okay, Meen.

219
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,600
I’ll share my location with you.

220
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,520
Can you stop bringing strangers to see me?

221
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,200
You know Meen.

222
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,960
She knows you too.

223
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,880
She just wants to drop by.

224
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,000
Seriously?

225
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,760
Are you two really friends?

226
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Quite a friendly talk you had there.

227
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,000
She’s polite to me.

228
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,000
Who am I to be rude to her?

229
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,320
It’s so hot. This shirt is making it worse!

230
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,760
- Meen.
- Hm!

231
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,160
How was your journey?

232
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,640
It wasn’t hard to come here.

233
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,640
So, where’s P’Day?

234
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,000
Meen, have a seat.

235
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
- Thank you.
- Give our guy some water.

236
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
This is for you.

237
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,760
This is Nick. He’s my friend.

238
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,840
- Hi!
- And this is Nill. He’s Day’s friend.

239
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,000
This is Gear. He’s also my friend.

240
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,960
And Night, he’s a younger brother of ...

241
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,600
P’Day.

242
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,400
Hello.

243
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,960
Uh, let's have our barbecue.

244
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,000
- Yeah.
- Let’s have our barbecue.

245
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,560
Let me add some vegetables.

246
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,160
- Add them in.
- Oh.

247
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,880
I got you a get-well gift.

248
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,440
I’m sorry I did visit you at the hospital.

249
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,880
Don’t trouble yourself.

250
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,640
I wouldn’t know ...

251
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,960
who you were anyway.

252
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,040
As I said, he lost his memory.

253
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,600
Let me take that from you.

254
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,320
If you’re not having this, I am!

255
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,720
Meen, Let me cook some for you.

256
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,440
Sauce?

257
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,160
Here’s water.

258
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,480
I bought you a cake.

259
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,280
It’s low-sugar.

260
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,680
Thank you, Meen.

261
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,160
Could that be an orange cake?

262
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,880
I just wanted to have an orange!

263
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,520
So, how long do you have to keep the cast on? P’Day.

264
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,560
I’ll take it off soon.

265
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,640
It’s so nice to hear that it’s not too bad.

266
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,400
Hm.

267
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,720
- Let’s have our barbecue!
- Yeah.

268
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,320
- Let’s have our barbecue!
- Do you want sauce?

269
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,320
This is your favorite, right? Let me cook it for you.

270
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,640
How’s your job lately?

271
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,440
Well,

272
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,920
online sales.

273
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,800
Yeah, I think I saw you.

274
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,800
Do you do live broadcasts on Facebook? I think I saw it recently.

275
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,000
- Yes.
- The randomized boxes?

276
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,720
- Yes.
- Ah-hah!

277
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
How’s business?

278
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,640
- It’s doing well.
- What do you sell?

279
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,040
- Everything.
- Everything?

280
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,000
We have to buy from you sometimes!

281
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,560
I need a toilet.

282
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,160
- Let me take you there.
- No!

283
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,560
That’s my carer’s job.

284
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,720
Day, what are you doing?

285
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,560
- What’s with you and the girl named Meen?
- I said we’re friends!

286
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,360
- I told you we’re friends.
- And what are we?
