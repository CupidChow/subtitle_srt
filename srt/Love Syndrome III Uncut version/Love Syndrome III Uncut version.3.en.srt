1
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,480
Why did my brother leave me with a stranger?

2
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,200
I’m not a stranger.

3
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,600
Anyone I can’t remember

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
is a stranger.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,960
Why didn’t you turn off all the light?

6
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,640
Uh.

7
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,640
So I can get you anything you need during the night.

8
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Hey!

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Your gut instinct still fast ever.

10
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
Kamol

11
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
Still remember me?

12
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,920
Of course,

13
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,080
How could I forget you?

14
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Here is a gift.

15
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
For you, A patient!

16
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,480
Did I drive and hit him?

17
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,280
He drove a car cut in front yours, and then he hit the tree.

18
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760
He is at ICU for 5 days now.

19
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Same situation as you,

20
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Got broken arm and legs.

21
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,720
I don't know when wake up, his Amnesia is the same level as you.

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,720
But you ever said that after the revenge, what's next?

23
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,680
Hey!!!

24
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,200
Ouch!!!

25
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
Remember me, don't you?

26
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,040
You drove and hit my parent death.

27
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,720
What do you want?

28
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,200
I will ask my Dad to pay for it!

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Your father used money to exploit the law

30
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,880
and made my parents guilty instead, is that it?

31
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,920
What else do you want?

32
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,280
They’re dead!

33
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,760
Yeah,

34
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,440
my parents are dead,

35
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,920
but no money can buy them back!

36
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Augh!

37
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Here... for my younger brother!!

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,960
Who has no chance to see my parent anymore?

39
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,520
Argh!

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,760
This is for your crime!

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,360
F..ck!!!

42
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,160
Ah!!!

43
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,120
You kill him!

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,840
What's next?

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,120
You did!!

46
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,560
You win!!

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,400
That's it!!

48
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,520
Listen to me.

49
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Even the revenge is equal?

50
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,800
It won't accept by the law.

51
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
If you got power!

52
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You can tell it's right!

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
or wrong!

54
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,840
I am Kamol.

55
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
We have been doing business for long.

56
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
You are not trusting me, are you?

57
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,800
It need to check?

58
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,360
For your satisfaction.

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,120
Dirty money can be cleaned.

60
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
but fake money can't make it real.

61
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,800
Boss!!! It's fake money!

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,920
Oh!!!

63
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
Argh. Ugh.

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,920
Damn it…You shot me?

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
You shot my boss!

66
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,760
Ah!!!

67
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Should be shot to death!

68
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,480
Ah!!!

69
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,240
Boss did say…killing him..what's next?

70
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,320
Killing is can not solve the problem.

71
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,240
But it make a trouble.

72
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,440
Ah!!!

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
Keep in mind..Rich Man

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,600
Ah!!!

75
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,920
My henchman saves your life.

76
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,960
So you have to choose how to end the problem yourself.

77
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
If you could not end this,

78
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
even still trouble

79
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,240
or your henchman around you do revenge later.

80
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,800
Just do it.

81
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,880
Do you release me now?

82
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,880
Kim!!!

83
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,640
Kamol, see! How does he look at me?

84
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,440
He is really amnesia.

85
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,040
Seeming  you not remembers.

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,120
How the problem was end between you and me?

87
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,480
Want to do it now?

88
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,640
I can only stay at 7 pm.

89
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,640
I have to go back to pick up Night.

90
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,600
You think I ask you to come here.

91
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,880
It just for doing something like that?

92
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,000
So why do we come here for what?

93
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,400
In between us

94
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,280
It was many things happened here over and over again.

95
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Oh where is the watch that I gave you?

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,720
I meet you many times but never see you wear it.

97
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,480
Anyway, you know it!

98
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,680
I sold it.

99
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,640
You sold it to pay for Night's tuition

100
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,600
that amount you can tell me.

101
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,960
I can do money transfer for you.

102
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,360
Why Day???

103
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,040
Why do you do that to sell the important thing that I gave to you?

104
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
You give me,

105
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,240
So it belongs to me.

106
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,440
Yes!!!

107
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
I give to you.

108
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
You can sell any for how many?

109
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,040
But not this watch

110
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,880
Do you know what?

111
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,560
Because this is our 3-months anniversary present.

112
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Kim

113
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,200
We are not boyfriend.

114
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,320
Day

115
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Can I ask you?

116
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,120
Since we have met and known each other till now.

117
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,360
Have you ever loved me?

118
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
The only one who I love.

119
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
Is Night.

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
My younger brother.

121
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,080
I don't think you will come.

122
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
I don't think you will come here.

123
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,880
If my boyfriend does not tell to come.

124
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,720
Boyfriend?

125
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
You dare to call somebody else your boyfriend?

126
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,960
A person who is not me!

127
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,720
F..ck!!!

128
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,000
I am really sorry. Kim

129
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,880
Sorry for that you can't love me, can you?

130
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,160
Sorry for selling your watch

131
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,920
to pay for Night's tuition.

132
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,680
And yes,

133
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,000
so sorry that I never thought of you as a boyfriend.

134
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,080
I’m sorry

135
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,200
for everything horrible that happened between us.

136
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,520
I’m sorry.

137
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,160
Well

138
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
I just wait to hear that's it.

139
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,040
And want to tell you that!

140
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,680
I was really really angry with you at that time.

141
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,240
As I grew older,

142
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,080
It made me realize that

143
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,440
Somebody who you are not love

144
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,680
no matter what they do, you could not love them.

145
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,520
You are my best friend for me.

146
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,120
I hope that someday.

147
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,800
I will be your best friend too.

148
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,240
Hey What's up? Feel better!

149
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,200
Yes, getting better.

150
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,120
I told you,.

151
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,080
You have me as a boyfriend. It is good.

152
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,600
Ok, let's go out.

153
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,720
How are you today?

154
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,840
Refilled for second time, sir!

155
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,360
You probably don't remember.

156
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,360
Kim is my beloved.

157
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Well, look at your face that can tell.

158
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,960
Ahh

159
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,920
I've never seen his face look like that.

160
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,840
So, Boss! You know.

161
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,120
Me and Kim used to be.

162
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,360
Oh, yeah.

163
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,160
When you were with Kim,

164
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
Have you worked with me yet?

165
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,720
Yes, I have.

166
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,240
So, Why don't you bring Kim to me?

167
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,960
So waste my time with somebody who are not the right guy.

168
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,120
take long to meet the right one, Kim

169
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,560
Boss

170
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,480
I used to tell you before,

171
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,360
you don't remember.

172
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,920
You probably don't remember.

173
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,200
And I used to run away from Kamol to stay with you and ITT too.

174
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,640
Because of ITT

175
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,680
Make me meet Kim and make me and Kim understand each other .

176
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,440
ITT, again

177
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,680
Hmm!!!

178
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
ITT always fussy.

179
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,400
But because of this, isn't it?

180
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,120
You in love with him.

181
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,040
Baby,

182
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,200
Please call ITT to come back.

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,360
I think, I almost finish.

184
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,680
Don't call me like that in front of him?

185
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,160
You act like ITT is stranger in your memory

186
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,720
Therefore, ITT can verify that

187
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,320
What is a relationship between you and him

188
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,880
Because you are really self-confident

189
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,320
But now

190
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,000
Even yourself memory

191
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,880
can't be trust

192
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,440
You are trying to use your gut survival instinct.

193
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,720
to protect yourself

194
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
Boss, I don't know, which is true or not true?

195
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,720
During those three years, everything about me changed.

196
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,960
I can’t believe it.

197
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,360
Everything

198
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,680
is real.

199
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Day.

200
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,560
You give your entire life

201
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,960
and love to one person.

202
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,320
Aside from your brother,

203
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,640
you have a family.

204
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,440
You have someone that you truly love.

205
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,880
That person is Itt.

206
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,880
I confirm it.

207
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,920
My boy.

208
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Hmm...

209
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,800
What's up?

210
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,600
Neil, when I warn you about racing.

211
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,880
You just listen to me.

212
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,080
If an accident happened like Day recently?

213
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,040
And you loss a memory

214
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,840
I definitely find a new boyfriend.

215
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,680
Short Guy, stop, stop!

216
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,120
As I do remember

217
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,800
You like a well-behaved like my younger brother, don't you?

218
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,320
So why did you end up with him?

219
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,360
So different as the sky to the ground

220
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,200
If I did not see you are sick, hmm.

221
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,200
I am also a well-behaved like folded cloths,

222
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,200
You’re lucky you on a hospital bed.

223
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Yes, I flirt with him.

224
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,320
I flirt when he's weak.

225
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,560
He was heart broken from Night, and go with Gear, my friend.

226
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,440
He is overwhelmed by my kindness.

227
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,960
He love the foods I cooked.

228
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,440
and he love that I am good.

229
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
I talk to my friends.

230
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
Cause you talk back to me

231
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,200
Sigh.....

232
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,920
Neil

233
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,400
What's up?

234
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,240
Why I let Night and Gear be together?

235
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
Uh…..Well…

236
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,920
Night and Gear love each other.

237
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,560
At first…you interfere with them.

238
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
Until Night was dragged away.

239
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,680
You and Gear went to help him.

240
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,440
Gear received a stab instead of you.

241
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,600
Because he didn't want Night sad if his only brother death

242
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,680
You..uh

243
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,680
Understand that?

244
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
So

245
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,040
Who drag Night away?

246
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,440
You….so curiously

247
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,120
- I think, Why you can’t remember.
- His leg!

248
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
Alright.

249
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,240
They were horrible people.

250
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,240
You have a lot of question, don’t you?

251
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,720
You can’t remember because your brain is damaged by the accident.

252
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,720
That gauze on your head?

253
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
It’s called post-traumatic amnesia.

254
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,440
When you get to recover, then you will remember

255
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,960
If you could remember by yourself then would be good for you

256
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,440
and them

257
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,400
Good for everyone too

258
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,280
Is it true?

259
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,560
Thus I and ITT

260
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,480
are boyfriend

261
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
uhh

262
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,240
Right!

263
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,440
You are so obsessed with ITT.

264
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,280
and let Neil with me to travel together.

265
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
Then I got each other, an another lover couple.

266
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,520
I was the one who approached ITT first, right?

267
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,760
Uh…

268
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,840
Yes..

269
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,040
You are really in love with ITT

270
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,280
See ..when about Gear and Night?

271
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,000
Crazy love till…

272
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,840
Fall in love could not step out.

273
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,000
Until you guys become boyfriend

274
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,440
You are so curiously, are you Ek Q Sang?

275
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,000
You are so crazy in love with ITT that never let ITT go anywhere.

276
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,720
At that time, I ask to travel.

277
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,280
He said go to ask Daddy first.

278
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,080
Ask for permission from Daddy, then I found out that!

279
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,680
Man…not Daddy

280
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,480
It's you!!!

281
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,280
OK

282
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,280
How much is it?

283
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
Here.

284
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,880
Of course.

285
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,000
Ok, thank you so much, See you next time

286
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,560
Did you fight with ITT last night?

287
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,960
A little bit

288
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
But we are ok now.

289
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,920
I can handle it.

290
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,120
Day!!!

291
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,520
You have change a lot.

292
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,120

293
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,080
Since your father

294
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,120
Your mother

295
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,640
pass away

296
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,520
I have never seen your smile again.

297
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
You show coldness to everyone.

298
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,400
Except brother Night!

299
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,520
or even smile at a customer.

300
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,360
Day just smile on business purpose

301
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,560
Not smile from sincerely heart.

302
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,800
Am I like that?

303
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,120
Umm!

304
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,680
But now

305
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,960
Day, you know?

306
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,680
Day, your smile is from sincerely heart

307
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,440
Smile from deeply inside with happiness

308
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,360
Less brutal.

309
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,880
Everything look better and getting better.

310
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,240
I hope that.

311
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,280
Day, You will not back as before

312
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,840
What did you say?

313
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,760
It is you! Present you! So good

314
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,120

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,000
Really smile, sincerely smile, happy smile from inside

316
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,280
Ahh

317
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,760
What?

318
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
Please wash this.

319
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,800
I’m not a maid.

320
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,880
- Want me to wipe the floor too?
- Sure.

321
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,640
- Clean the cabinet?
- Of course.

322
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,360
Look at the smile!

323
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,600
Knock Knock Knock

324
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,080
hello!

325
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,600
Opps!

326
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,200
I am not use to this sight.

327
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,560
When see it again

328
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,840
so scare

329
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,240
The atmosphere is just as scary as before.

330
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,680
Gifts and stuff from our employee

331
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Umm

332
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,080
They really want to visit you.

333
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,240
But I tell them that it's ok, I will be a representative for them.

334
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,240
Don't want to distrubing them and nobody will not stay at shop.

335
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,680
I don’t want your shop to lose income.

336
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,400
Yes, that's right!

337
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,760
I am ok, nothing much.

338
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Huuu

339
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,320
How is nothing much?

340
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
Broken legs, broken arms, broken heads, like this,

341
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
it's still nothing.

342
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,920
Hmm

343
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,520
Day, did you know?

344
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,080
On that day, ITT know you got car accident.

345
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,960
He's worried, could not eat or sleep.

346
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,840
Suddenly come to see you right away.

347
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,120
on late at night

348
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,840
ITT got sick too.

349
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,560
Look!

350
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,520
I feel so pity.

351
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,760
I feel so sorry for both of you.

352
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,600
Look at you.

353
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,480
Got a body sick and heart sick

354
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,160
How is my dessert that I brought for you

355
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,640
How is it, good?

356
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,840
Yes, sis Bell. Thank you so much.

357
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,680
So good

358
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,520
Are you tried?

359
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,080
If so, please take a break and relax

360
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,400
can be weak sometime.

361
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,680
Sine Day was admitted at the hospital.

362
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,600
ITT always take a good care of you.

363
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,760
ITT so extremely patience.

364
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,360
To taking care who has broken legs and broken arms

365
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,480
But he look at you like a stranger.

366
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,000
It’s hard to handle.

367
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,280
ITT, you are the best.

368
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,520
Everything that you do, you did your best

369
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,400
ITT try your best

370
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,520
ITT, you so patience

371
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,560
But if do my best enough

372
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,240
Day would be remembered.

373
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,760
If it is better than that

374
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,560
Day won't be hurt like this.

375
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,520
No no no you good

376
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,040
Don't blame yourself. OK?

377
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,960
Everything you did, you did the best

378
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,760
Don't think that.

379
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,280
Ahh

380
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,360
Let's do this!

381
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,960
Next time going to Kanchanaburi.

382
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
I will take you to see a doctor.

383
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
Oh go to see neurosurgery doctor, right? P'Bell

384
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
No…

385
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
A fortune teller

386
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,120
This one’s great!

387
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,160
This fortune teller

388
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,000
She just closes her eye,

389
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,400
She made a good prediction.

390
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,360
I accepted.

391
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,400
Trust me..Very good prediction!

392
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,560
If P'Bell say it's good!

393
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,640
I will try.

394
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,200
Umm….That's right.

395
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,840
Alright?

396
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
I like having my old Itt back.
