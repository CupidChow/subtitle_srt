1
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,240
(Cheering)

2
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,240
(Cheering)

3
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Here you go!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Wow!

5
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,080
Let’s eat!

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,560
So good!

7
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,540
You having a BBQ buffet with us
reminds me of my birthday.

8
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,180
Oh, of course!

9
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,720
It was so heated!

10
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,380
Isn’t that right? Jealous boy?

11
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,620
(Laughing)

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,220
What? J’Bale?

13
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,060
I didn’t start it.

14
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,860
What you mean ...

15
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,020
is that Day started it

16
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
because he was too hot?

17
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,900
What is this about?

18
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,720
You don’t want to know.

19
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
I do.

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Hey, there.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I’ll tell you everything myself.

22
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,940
So, several months ago,

23
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,220
You and Itt came to Kanchanaburi.

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,920
On that day,

25
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,760
it was coincidentally Por’s birthday too.

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,800
So, we went to celebrate her birthday at P’Bank’s.

27
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,540
However,

28
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,900
the spicy part started when ...

29
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,260
Poom,

30
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,340
your ex. Can you remember him?

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,800
He came, and ...

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,080
Hoo!

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,920
Things got heated!

34
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,280
Hey!

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,760
Why did you step on my toe?

36
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,700
And I can’t say what happened after that.

37
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,820
I could never forget that birthday.

38
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,060
Obviously.

39
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,900
After the incident,

40
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,540
Day and Itt

41
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,580
settled this.

42
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,460
Uh ...

43
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,820
I really do not know what happened next.

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,800
♫ Happy birthday to you. Hey! Hey! ♫
[Six months before the accident.]

45
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,000
♫ Happy birthday to you. Hey! Hey! ♫

46
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,200
♫ Happy birthday to you. Hey! Hey! ♫

47
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,740
♫ Happy birthday. Happy birthday. ♫

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,800
Do you mind ...

49
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,320
- Huh?
- if I have a toast with you?

50
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,720
He might not,

51
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,940
but I do.

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,300
It’s just a toast.

53
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,220
What’s wrong with that?

54
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,140
Then,

55
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,200
I will have a toast with you for him.

56
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,380
Hey!

57
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,760
I apologize for my boyfriend’s behavior.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Please go back to your table.

59
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,060
Are you siding with him?

60
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,000
He started it!

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,380
Didn’t you see that?

62
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,480
Don’t get too confident.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,080
He’ll leave you pretty soon.

64
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,360
I’m not as low as you.

65
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,020
He’s been dating me for two years,

66
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,340
but you?

67
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,340
Wasn’t it only a night?

68
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,380
You want to have a go?

69
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,620
What are you fighting for?

70
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,540
This is Por’s birthday!

71
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,140
I don’t like him!

72
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,620
I’m going home!

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
Itt!

74
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,740
What?

75
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,200
I’m going home!

76
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,960
Didn’t you tell me ...

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,000
that you’re not ready for commitment?

78
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,660
And what is that?

79
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,140
I hadn’t found the right one then.

80
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
Can I be yours too?

81
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,920
Poom, you know well ...

82
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
that I’m not a perfectly decent person,

83
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,400
but I’m willing to do anything terrible
if anyone messes with my lover.

84
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Let’s have our cake!

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,640
Stop with this nonsense!

86
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah, I’m nonsensical!

87
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,540
Being protective of you is nonsensical too, right?

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,160
You jumped to the conclusion,

89
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,060
and got mad all by yourself!

90
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,340
Yeah, I am! I’m annoying and nonsensical!

91
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,780
Nobody did anything. I’m the crazy one!

92
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,860
- Is that what you want to hear?
- Stop being sarcastic!

93
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,140
Why? I don’t like him!

94
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,140
I don’t like it when you’re onto someone.

95
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,900
Do you think only you can be protective of me?

96
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,340
You believe I’m yours only! You are mine only too!

97
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,380
How is this hard to understand?

98
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,360
I don’t like it when someone’s messing with you.

99
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,620
I don’t like seeing you being close to anyone.

100
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,360
- Itt!
- Ugh!

101
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,700
Day!

102
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,120
- Day! Get off!
- Stop!

103
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,880
I’ll make you believe

104
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,220
that I’m yours only.

105
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,180
I’ve never done this to anyone.

106
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,040
You will be my first

107
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
and my last.

108
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,100
Do it one more time,

109
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,740
and you would’ve pulled an all-nighter.

110
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,580
Are you drunk?

111
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,060
No, I slipped on a carpet.

112
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
Are you sure?

113
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,460
Yeah.

114
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,580
And you? Drunk?

115
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,740
Hey! Day!

116
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,340
You said you’re my lover.

117
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,960
Yeah.

118
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,960
So, can you help remind me of that?

119
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,700
How many times do we do it in a week?

120
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,340
Two or three?

121
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,000
Serious.

122
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,240
How many times?

123
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
Three or four?

124
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,280
That’s quite a lot.

125
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,380
The doctor told me

126
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,560
that performing activities that I used to do a lot

127
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,380
will help me regain my memories.

128
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,020
I guess we have to ...

129
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,780
Day.

130
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,180
Do you want to remember us

131
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
or am I just here to please you?

132
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,440
Sometimes,

133
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,000
I felt like you were protective of me.

134
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,120
And sometimes,

135
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,180
you made me feel like ...

136
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,420
I’m just an object you want to keep.

137
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,580
So,

138
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,300
what am I to you?

139
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,940
Whatever you believe you are.

140
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,800
I guess I’m just here to please you.

141
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,340
I’m just an object you want to keep.

142
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,020
Silly you!

143
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,600
If I want to fulfill my “needs,”

144
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,360
anyone can fill that role for me.

145
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
What am I to you?

146
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,260
- A silly person.
- Hey!

147
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,200
Be serious.

148
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,560
Give me a straight answer.

149
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,420
Itt.

150
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,840
I want to remember.

151
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,980
Really?

152
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,380
Yeah.

153
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400
I want to remember

154
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,240
- why did I even date a silly person Iike you.
- Day!

155
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,040
This is for your trouble last night,

156
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
for hurting you.

157
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,140
You’re my lover. How do you not know I don’t like dessert?

158
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,040
I do,

159
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,440
but you always take it if it’s me who gives you dessert.

160
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,140
And this is what you always do,

161
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,600
but you normally wash it off with black coffee.

162
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,100
Day, what’s your plan for today?

163
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,040
Our shop is closed.

164
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,600
- Are you ...
- I’m going to finish some accounting at the shop.

165
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
It’s been a long time.

166
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,100
I guess I’ll go with J’Bale.

167
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,580
This is it! This is it!
This is it!

168
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,000
This is the place.

169
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,940
The most accurate fortune teller in Kanchanaburi!

170
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,860
The blinded fortune teller!

171
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,960
Very accurate!

172
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,000
I see everything.

173
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Though, my eyes are closed,

174
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,160
my third eye is wide open.

175
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,020
- I’m leaving.
- Wait!

176
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,380
It’s just a metaphor!

177
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,460
She’s really accurate. Give her a chance.

178
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,700
What guidance do you seek?

179
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,300
Fortune teller, please. The story is ...

180
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,100
this young man’s boyfriend lost his memory.

181
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,400
We’d like you to see ...

182
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,000
when will his boyfriend’s memory return.

183
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,060
Of course, but I need to change my form.

184
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,300
Change your form?

185
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,440
She’s like the biggest drag queen ever.

186
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,940
Extend to me thy hand.

187
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Love has been unkind to you.

188
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,040
You have been giving your all to something that might not return you favor.

189
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,800
You give him a hundred. You are returned ten.

190
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,260
So sad that your true worth is not recognized.

191
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,660
You’re just keeping with a hopeless thought of ...

192
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,740
“He loves me. He’s just bad at expressing himself.”

193
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,440
Hey! I don’t want you to do me!

194
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,920
That was my hand!

195
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,980
See this young man!

196
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,660
- Hard.
- Hard luck?

197
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,620
Hardened muscles. All protein!

198
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,900
It’s a biceps. It’s a triceps. It’s forceps. It’s ...

199
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,560
Ceps, ceps, ceps.

200
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,960
Ah! That feels pretty good.

201
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
You’re almost done?

202
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,000
I am finished.

203
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,060
Are you done with your fortune-telling?

204
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,100
What is his fortune like?

205
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,540
Will his boyfriend’s memory return?

206
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,100
The lost memory?

207
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,540
We need a tool. A hard object.

208
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,420
Hit him with a hardwood stick, and his memory will return.

209
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,500
Young man!

210
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,520
- I sense a person with previous deeds on you.
- Huh?

211
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,100
- A person with previous deeds on me?
- You see that too?

212
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,460
- That’s my boyfriend.
- That’s what I thought.

213
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,260
You two are as handsome as each other.

214
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,580
You’re going to hit who with what?

215
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,100
We don’t need to do that.

216
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,780
I’ll look for new ways that might help..

217
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,460
Let’s see.

218
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,900
- Extend your hands!
- Here.

219
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,140
I can feel it!

220
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,940
Aw. God. Itai, itai. Iki, iki.

221
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,780
Argh. I can really feel it.

222
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,620
You can feel his fortune?

223
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,120
The veins on his arms. I can feel it.

224
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,640
I can feel the biceps and triceps.

225
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven ...

226
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
eight, nine. Aw! Urgh! Get off of me!

227
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,800
Argh! That hurts. Release me!

228
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,280
In this young man’s fortune,

229
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,260
I see a shadow of someone lurking.

230
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,280
It’s following you.

231
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,000
And this shadow ...

232
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,680
will lead you and your boyfriend ...

233
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,660
to horrible misfortune

234
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,480
and leave you a scar.

235
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,780
That shadow is coming back.

236
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,260
Either one of you ...

237
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,460
will fall prey to the karma of your past.

238
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,580
One of you might be gone.

239
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,960
Huh? Who am I?

240
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,140
Let’s go.

241
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,040
Young man, remember this.

242
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,940
Love is driven by memories.

243
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,640
Who am I?

244
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,500
Who am I?

245
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
What are you trying to say with that face?

246
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,760
Do you believe that lunatic?

247
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,120
We should think about it.

248
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,760
I’ve had strange feelings lately.

249
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,300
Wait, N’Itt?

250
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,700
Do you have the sixth sense?

251
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,200
Do you?

252
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,180
No, P’Bale.

253
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,980
Lately,

254
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,940
an unknown number has been calling me.

255
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,640
What? A scam call?

256
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,920
Right?

257
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,960
I picked up, and they didn’t talk.

258
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,120
Who do you think it was?

259
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,600
I’ll deal with them.

260
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,780
Day!

261
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,000
Calm down.

262
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,800
I’m not sure if it’s him.

263
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,840
If you get the call again, let me know.

264
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,400
Uncle Day visits Ingfah!

265
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,120
Wow! She has grown up.

266
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,840
Three years of his memory were lost.

267
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,040
I guess Ingfah was a little girl then.

268
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,700
Uncle Itt is the boyfriend of uncle Day!

269
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,460
Do we know each other?

270
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,360
You used to bring me here.

271
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,920
Does that mean you forget about telling me to not bring Ingfah here?

272
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,440
If you can remember, why did you bring her here?

273
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,200
Life is complicated.

274
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,700
I’m a single dad.

275
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,360
Day, that unknown number is calling.

276
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,060
Take it and turn on the speaker.

277
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,600
Hello?

278
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,580
Who’s that?

279
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,660
Hello?

280
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,680
Who do you want to talk to?

281
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,560
It hung up.

282
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,300
Do you think this is your past enemy, the one you told me about?

283
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,240
Who is it?

284
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,800
I’m not sure,

285
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
but I can think of someone.

286
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,680
Who?

287
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,460
You can’t remember him.

288
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,160
Then just ask if it’s him.

289
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,300
I’ve seen this car for a long time. What’s the issue with it?

290
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,220
Uh.

291
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,100
When will the client retrieve it?

292
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,880
Bast, do you know when?

293
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,740
Yeah, today.

294
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,660
Deal with it.

295
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,020
Hey, Itt.

296
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,640
Dad.

297
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,740
Do you still contact uncle Supot?

298
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,640
What is it, Itt?

299
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,560
About P.

300
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,660
Is he still out of the country?

301
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,320
Supot ordered him to never come back to Thailand again.

302
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,060
What is it, Itt?

303
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,580
No, I was just wondering about something.

304
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,740
Let me know right away if there’s anything.

305
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,420
Of course, Dad.

306
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,600
I doubt it.

307
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,460
If you return to Bangkok, pay your mom and me a visit.

308
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,320
P?

309
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,600
You can’t remember him.

310
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Losing memory has its good side. I can forget horrible people.

311
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,660
I don’t want you to forget everything.

312
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,920
There’s us in his story too.

313
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,060
We risked our lives,

314
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,620
and we saved each other.

315
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,600
He made me realized

316
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,300
what a selfless love looks like.
