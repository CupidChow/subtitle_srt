1
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,160
P’Day!

2
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,680
- He’s waking up! P’Day!
- Day.

3
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,080
- Day, you’re waking up!
- Doctor!

4
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,000
- Honey! Press the button!
- P’Day.

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,520
- Night!
- Yes?

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,000
Who is that?

7
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,480
- Hey!
- Hm?

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,720
Look up.

9
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,200
- What?
- Right there.

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,320
What?

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
What is this?

12
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,920
Happy birthday.

13
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Couple rings?

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,840
With our names on them?

15
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,600
As long as I do remember

16
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,480
Love is not just happened.

17
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,480
And it never ever happened.

18
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
If finally

19
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
I can't remember anyway.

20
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
What do you think?

21
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,040
Will it happen again?

22
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,200
Please bring back my old Day.

23
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,960
Bring back my old Day.

24
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,880
Bring back my old Day!

25
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,520
P’Itt.

26
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,280
Night,

27
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,680
why are we back to where it started?

28
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,040
I hurt him again.

29
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,880
Don’t blame yourself like this.

30
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,200
I did everything I could

31
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,520
while he was recovering his memories

32
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
to return them to him.

33
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
I know.

34
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,520
Everything was in vein.

35
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,400
He lost his memories again.

36
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
Don’t lose hope now.

37
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,120
P’Day is still with us.b

38
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Is Night with you?
Day’s looking for Night.

39
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, he’s with me.

40
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
You two, come in.

41
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
Yes, Dad.

42
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,360
Dad told us to get up there.

43
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,360
Night.

44
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Adjust my bed.

45
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
Of course.

46
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
Consider it done.

47
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,800
Why are you standing there?

48
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
Respond when you’re spoken to!

49
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,920
And where were you?

50
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,360
Why did you leave me alone, Itt?

51
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,720
What do you want me to say?
You can’t remember ...

52
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
You ...

53
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
You remember my name?

54
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,440
Why can’t I remember my boyfriend?

55
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,960
We’ve been together for almost three years.

56
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
Day.

57
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,680
You ...

58
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,680
You remember?

59
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,760
Yeah,

60
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,280
I do.

61
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,080
Itt.

62
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,320
Itthipol Charoenarat.

63
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,320
Do you want your parents’ names too?

64
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Day, Day.

65
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,840
I thought you had forgotten me again.

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Why did you have to ignore me?

67
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,040
Didn’t you remember what you did wrong?

68
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,680
You ruined my plan to deal with P.

69
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,760
I’m sorry.

70
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,880
You stupidly risked yourself

71
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,840
despite our promise.

72
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,920
- I told you I couldn’t help myself.
- Don’t argue with me!

73
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,600
Day.

74
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,600
I’m sorry.

75
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,360
Ahem. I guess ...

76
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,360
I should call Gear to tell him the good news.

77
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,720
P’Day and P’Itt.

78
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,680
Itt.

79
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,440
I’m sorry

80
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,280
for forgetting you,

81
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,200
for making you sad,

82
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,000
and for hurting you.

83
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,920
You didn’t want to forget.

84
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,160
Don’t blame yourself.

85
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
If someone is to be blamed,

86
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,720
shouldn’t it be me

87
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,520
who was childish and got you into an accident?

88
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,880
No.

89
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
I got into an accident myself.

90
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,280
Don’t say that again. Okay?

91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,440
But ...

92
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,920
Now that you remember, are you alright with the video?

93
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,280
When you got mad and left me,

94
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,880
I couldn’t imagine

95
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,320
what I could do to make you forgive me again.

96
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,520
I didn’t leave because I was mad at you.

97
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,000
I was mad at myself.

98
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,480
I regret ...

99
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,400
hurting someone I love.

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,960
Even if with my memory intact,

101
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,640
anything that makes us fight

102
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,880
will make me regret.

103
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,600
Day,

104
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,840
we’ve come so far.

105
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,560
We’ve been through so much

106
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,040
before arriving on this day.

107
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,520
The version of you I see today

108
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,200
is someone who protects me.

109
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,360
If you’ve got time, think about the future.

110
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,720
Hm.

111
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,160
And my ring? Where’s it?

112
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,920
It feels weirdly empty without it.

113
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,280
I gave it back to you

114
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
because I don’t want to keep it to myself again.

115
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,720
Now that’s more like my hand.

116
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
Come get a hug.

117
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,280
You’re not going to forget me again?

118
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,880
No.

119
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,520
- Maybe.
- Hm!

120
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,400
Aw.

121
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,240
And you dare to face us again? P.

122
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,720
Just tell us what you have in mind.

123
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,120
I want to apologize to you both

124
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,960
for having to deal with all these.

125
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,840
Someone who seeks revenge on us from the other side of the world

126
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,040
now turning into a good guy?
Why?

127
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,760
Because of my dad.

128
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,280
He had to kneel in front of you

129
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,200
because of me.

130
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,120
If he actually got hurt,

131
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
it would be because of me and the trouble I caused.

132
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,400
I don’t want to cause my parents trouble anymore.

133
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,640
You should stop blaming others

134
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,320
and look at yourself.

135
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,440
That’s why I want to end it all here.

136
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I will pursue a study abroad

137
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,120
so I want to say sorry to you.

138
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,320
Did you know

139
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,000
that the sincerest apology

140
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,720
is to not make the same mistake again.

141
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,280
I will not disappoint my parents again.

142
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,280
You are fortunate

143
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,480
to always have your parents by your side no matter how many times you cause trouble,

144
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,480
always giving you chances after chances.

145
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,600
Are you aware that your dad is a very respectable man?

146
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,080
Don’t hurt him ever again.

147
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
- Hm.
- As for your study,

148
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,720
work hard for it.

149
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,320
Otherwise, you might fail.

150
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,040
I’m convinced you have a surplus of stupid thoughts.

151
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,200
Do I have to stand here and take it?

152
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,520
Itt.

153
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,880
I know that you have so much to say about me.

154
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,320
Say it. Say it all.

155
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,320
I’m too tired for that.

156
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,800
It’s a waste of time.

157
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,920
I’d like to punch you in the face once.

158
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,640
We’ll remember all the time we had together,

159
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,680
both good

160
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,440
and bad.

161
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,560
Okay?

162
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,560
Thank you.

163
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,400
Thank you for everything.

164
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,800
And I ...

165
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,400
thank you too

166
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,880
for everything.

167
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,920
Night.

168
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,440
P’Itt.

169
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,800
I’d like to cook Day breakfast.

170
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,160
Are you sure?

171
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,880
Of course, it’s a great idea.

172
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,440
What are you going to make?

173
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,240
Day’s favorite,

174
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,720
Redtail catfish topped with sauce,

175
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
Fried tilapia and sour soup,

176
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
and Fried prawn in tamarind glaze.

177
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,960
I think you should go for just one dish.

178
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,480
Fine.

179
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,640
How about fried fish

180
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,280
and the sour sauce like we always do?

181
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,320
But you burned the kitchen last time.

182
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,200
It’ll be different this time.

183
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,440
- You can be my assistant.
- No!

184
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,560
I’ll do it myself.

185
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
And you

186
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,880
can be my assistant.

187
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,240
Are you sure?

188
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,920
Of course.

189
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,360
Slice it like that.

190
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,640
- Watch your fingers.
- I know.

191
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,720
How about some tears?

192
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,840
- No, that’s fish sauce.
- Alright.

193
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Night, when the fish is ...

194
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,560
- crispy and yellow ...
- Rest it to drain oil so it’s not too wet.

195
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,200
- Okay.
- I’ll go wake P’Gear up.

196
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,400
Sure.

197
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,000
I’ll deal with the cooking.
It will be fine.

198
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,760
Go on. Don’t worry.

199
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,720
Hey, Day. You’re up?

200
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,560
- Your breakfast is still cooking.
- Haven’t I told you to not cook again?

201
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,880
I don’t want to call the fire department.

202
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,080
But I wanted to learn how.

203
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,640
Why?

204
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,920
You don’t like my food?

205
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,280
I do. I want to eat what you cook for the rest of your life.

206
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,800
But I want to learn how

207
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,800
so I can cook for you when you’re ill.

208
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,200
When you were hurt,

209
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,480
I wanted to do so many things for you,

210
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
but I had no idea how.

211
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,160
I can remember now.

212
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,720
It’s okay.

213
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I know,

214
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,400
but in a couple's life,
if someone got ill,

215
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,320
the other should take care of that someone.

216
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,320
How about you keep this until I’m ill?

217
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,360
Okay?

218
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
I’ll teach you.

219
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,040
I don’t want to rebuild the kitchen.

220
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,640
Seriously?

221
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,080
Then, please take a seat.

222
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,520
I’ll serve you.

223
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,320
Go. Take a seat.

224
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,680
Now that you fried me a fish,

225
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,320
how about feeding me too?

226
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,960
Yes, sir.

227
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,000
So appetizing.

228
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Here.

229
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,600
What do you think?

230
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,800
- Did Night make the sauce?
- What?

231
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,360
You didn’t think I made that?

232
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,080
- You made that?
- Yeah.

233
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,000
Why can’t you say nice things about it?

234
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,560
Huh?

235
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,400
Good.

236
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,080
Just “good”?

237
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,480
- Delicious.
- Good.

238
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,960
Then eat more.

239
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
Here.

240
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,680
- You got a lot better.
- Absolutely.

241
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,640
It’s because I’m your boyfriend.

242
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
Wait.

243
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
Or am I your wife?

244
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,280
I forgot your reward.

245
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,480
- Day.
- Huh?

246
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,120
Can you teach me how to make other dishes?

247
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,240
Try slicing it.

248
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,520
Me?

249
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,280
Let me show you first.

250
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,840
- I’m not doing this.
- Why?

251
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,800
- What are you going to do?
- Do it yourself.

252
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
Sure! I’ll show you.

253
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,920
How to slice ...

254
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,400
You just recovered.
You don’t need to rush back to work.

255
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Hm?

256
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,200
Itt and I have had a long break, Dad.

257
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,680
I need to help you and Mom.

258
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,640
Itt said the same thing.

259
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,400
It’s like you both discussed this before.

260
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Hm?

261
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,960
If I had known this, I’d have hit him with a hard wooden stick on his head

262
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,200
the moment I learned he lost his memory.

263
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,040
We can’t do that.

264
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,280
Hitting his head like that

265
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,680
could risk even more injuries

266
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,600
and you might put him into a coma.

267
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,400
The chance of getting a concussion and it returning your memory is slim.

268
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,080
This is a big deal.

269
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,880
Day’s condition is nothing to worry about,

270
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,240
but Itt, you still have panic attacks.

271
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,960
I think I can deal with it.

272
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,400
When I rode a motorcycle to get to Day, I was fine.

273
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,640
We can’t be sure.

274
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,560
You need to continue your treatment,

275
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,240
attend mental therapy,

276
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,880
and do not stop taking drugs without a doctor’s advice.
