Why are you staring at me?

00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,181
I never noticed before.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,180
You look good when you're sleeping.

We're still at the office.

21
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,300
We shouldn't do anything inappropriate.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,621
Then let's go home.

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,061
Yi Ning signed the contract with Mr. Li?

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,109
Yi Ning's got some skills after all.

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,510
She actually managed

26
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,109
to put together a proposal overnight.

27
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,109
Go check if someone helped her.

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,981
Got it.

29
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,510
(Isn't that the guy)

30
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,501
(who flirted with me at the bar?)

31
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,901
Gold Digger?

32
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,660
What are you doing here?

33
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:12,100
Don't tell me
you're Ms. Yi's new husband?

34
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:13,820
Jiang Wenwen!

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,860
Are you that desperate for a man that you
had to go after someone else's husband?

36
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,029
Didn't expect Ms. Yi to treasure

37
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,140
and spoil her husband so much.

38
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,069
Don't you know?

39
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,589
Your precious husband is nothing

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,380
but a two-timing gold digger!

41
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,181
It's not like that, Ning!

42
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,749
There's nothing between me and her.

43
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,349
Still denying it?

44
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,341
Trying to cut ties
after you've found someone better?

45
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,301
Now that Yi An has passed away,

46
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,501
doesn't that mean Yi Yuan
will soon fall into your dad's hands?

47
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,021
Of course. Just watch.

48
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:53,061
Sooner or later, my dad will make
Yi Yuan a Qian family business.

49
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,181
By then, I'll be the real heiress.

50
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,390
Then I'd better stick close to you.

51
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,501
If you make me happy.

52
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:07,061
There's a guy over there
who keeps glancing at you.

53
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:09,990
Hey, beautiful.

54
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,781
Mind if I buy you a drink?

55
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,830
You don't exactly look like
you're rolling in money,

56
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,341
but you have your looks going for you.

57
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:24,469
With your financial standing,

58
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,181
how many drinks can you really afford?

59
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:28,380
I'll buy us drinks.

60
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,629
Waiter,

61
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,980
bring me your best bottle of whiskey.

62
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:34,309
Since you're so eager,

63
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,540
then drink with me tonight.

64
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,110
We're fated to meet,

65
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:43,629
but I still don't know your name.

66
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,700
Wenwen.

67
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,181
Wenwen.
There are lots of girls named Wenwen.

68
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,909
I need a way to make you stand out.

69
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,830
You're different from the others.

70
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,189
Then remember this.

71
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,349
My last name is Jiang.

72
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,860
The "Jiang" for Yangtze River.

73
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,349
Got it?

74
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,820
Jiang Wenwen.

75
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,621
It's a beautiful name.

76
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,430
You sure know how to sweet-talk.

77
00:04:05,431 --> 00:04:06,781
Drink up!

78
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,749
Wenwen, it's fate that we met tonight.

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,021
Can we take a photo together
to mark the occasion?

80
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,100
Sure!

81
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,829
Let me see it.

82
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,500
Did it turn out well?

83
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:25,821
You made me look so fat!

84
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,740
Li, take another one for us.

85
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:30,060
Come closer.

86
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,461
Ready. Closer.

87
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,180
Find out who this woman is.

88
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:51,440
I was just socializing.

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,341
What's wrong with trying to build up
a customer base for my restaurant?

90
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:57,021
"Just socializing"?

91
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,790
You were trying to make moves on me

92
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,021
because you thought I was rich.

93
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:01,389
Ms. Yi,

94
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,590
this man is only with you

95
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,030
for your money.

96
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:05,590
You should kick him to the curb now.

97
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,781
So what?

98
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,470
It just so happens I am rich.

99
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:10,461
Isn't that right?

100
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,581
But...

101
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:16,021
But what if he's secretly flirting
with other girls too?

102
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,461
Doesn't that bother you?

103
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,470
He's met so many women,

104
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:21,581
yet he still chose me in the end.

105
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,990
Jiang Wenwen,
the problem isn't with my husband.

106
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,141
The problem is you.

107
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,740
After all, he didn't choose you.

108
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,100
No...

109
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:35,740
Enough. If you're going to faint,
do it at home.

110
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,110
Ning, it's not what you think it is!

111
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,430
- It's really not...
- Enough.

112
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,341
We'll talk about this at home.

113
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,980
Pretending we're strangers now?

114
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,180
Jiang Wenwen already filled me in.

115
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,180
Got kicked out by Ning, didn't you?

116
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:16,581
Mind your own business.

117
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,189
Shen Qianze.

118
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,269
Do you really think Ning
will forgive a man

119
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,709
with ulterior motives?

120
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,100
Quit dreaming.

121
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,550
Do you think that without me,

122
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,100
Ning will fall for you?

123
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,269
Mr. Yan,

124
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,500
seems like you're not very self-aware.

125
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:35,389
What's that supposed to mean?

126
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,781
Anything you can do, I can do too.

127
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:41,300
Really?
Did you ask your dad about that yet?

128
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,941
Yan Ri'an, looks like
you're the one dreaming here.

129
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,100
Ning...

130
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,509
I was wrong.

131
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,701
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:22,581
Ning, I'm so sorry.

133
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,100
Go on. What were you wrong about?

134
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,740
About everything.

135
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,590
I swear, If I had known I'd meet you,

136
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:32,701
I would've stayed faithful
and upheld proper manly virtue.

137
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,821
I already knew about your past.

138
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,461
You knew?

139
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,870
You really think I'd marry
some random guy off the street?

140
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:48,141
Even job applicants
get background checks these days.

141
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,781
Then why did you still choose me?

142
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,540
To be honest, I hesitated.

143
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,461
But I figured

144
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,740
we're both in this
for business reasons anyway.

145
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,620
It's a contract marriage, after all.

146
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,381
You want something from me,
and I want something from you.

147
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,461
Neither of us is more noble
than the other.

148
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,221
Besides,

149
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,100
I chose you because you once helped me.

150
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,901
Just like this, with a pot of hot soup.

151
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,740
Mr. Zhao?

152
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,149
Can you help me book a plane ticket?

153
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,110
(Overseas)
I have to go back home tonight.

154
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,269
It's not possible, Ms. Yi.

155
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,941
Who would fly in weather like this?

156
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:33,590
Mr. Yang, just one ticket.

157
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:34,629
I have to go back tonight.

158
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,789
I need to get home.

159
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,070
Just one!

160
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,830
What if I pay ten times the price?

161
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,350
Please!

162
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:41,429
Sorry, Ning.

163
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,900
My hands are tied.

164
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,860
Grandpa?

165
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,780
Ning, your mother

166
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,260
didn't make it...

167
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,860
What's wrong?

168
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,980
It's cold.
Let's get you a warm bowl of soup.

169
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:47,980
Drink.

170
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,221
No matter what happened, it will pass.

171
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:18,740
Someone who can show

172
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:23,941
such selfless kindness to a stranger

173
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,740
can't possibly be a bad person.

174
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,061
That's why I chose you.

175
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,190
Ning, I said yes to the arrangement

176
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,980
because you checked all the right boxes.

177
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:41,149
But I've come to realize

178
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,350
you're the first person to respect me,
encourage me,

179
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,181
and give me real support.

180
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,661
So, Ning,

181
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:52,500
I genuinely care about you now.

182
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,821
I believe you.

183
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,269
You must've had
a hard time all these years,

184
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,749
surviving alone in this world.

185
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,661
But now, we're a family.

186
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,061
I'll always be by your side.

187
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,100
Boss, the meat is...

188
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:22,221
The meat is ready.

189
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,749
I didn't see anything.

190
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,749
Nothing at all.

191
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,860
Carry on.

192
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,629
Pardon me.

193
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,701
Don't mind me...

194
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:31,389
I'm fine!

195
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,470
Don't worry about me!

196
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:33,389
Sorry for interrupting!

197
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,541
Carry on...

198
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:42,000
- I'll drink the soup.
- You should have some soup.

199
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:56,994
(A Little Restaurant)

200
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,780
Yi Ning's not that sharp after all.

201
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,020
She actually thinks you're a good guy.

202
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:10,380
Do I not look like a good guy?

203
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,509
She's a good person herself.

204
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,509
That's why she assumes
everyone else is kind too.

205
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,661
But if she finds out your true motives,

206
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:21,941
do you think she'll still accept you?

207
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:27,341
I don't know.

208
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,380
She's sincere toward me.

209
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,260
I'd rather not hurt her if I can.

210
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,100
So what's your plan now?

211
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:41,509
I couldn't find anything useful

212
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,701
from Yi Ning.

213
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:45,780
If I want to uncover
more important information,

214
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,980
I'll have to sound out Qian Lei instead.

215
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,421
I've missed you so much, baby!

216
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,581
Come on, baby!

217
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,990
Let's keep it down.

218
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,830
Says the one
who always makes the most noise.

219
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,140
What can I say?
This old dog's still got some bite.

220
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,029
You're still so youthful.

221
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,269
Always looking for excitement.

222
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,461
I've got something even more exciting.

223
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,240
Hold on. We've got business
to discuss first.

224
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,549
Mr. Wang from the raw materials factory
asked me to check with you.

225
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,549
Can Yi Yuan increase
the raw material order this year?

226
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,470
Yi Ning's been keeping
a tight grip on things lately.

227
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,620
Wait until the heat dies down.

228
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:04,950
Just calm Wang down for now.

229
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,549
Again? I always have to handle this.

230
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,341
I'll make it worth your while.

231
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,181
- Baby...
- Oh, you...

232
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,740
Did you hear something?

233
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,221
No.

234
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:35,481
(Next Episode)

235
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,880
- What do you think you're doing?
- What's wrong with you?

236
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,061
Adulterous scoundrels!

237
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,821
How could you do this to my mother?

238
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:45,980
Ning, you had too much to drink.

239
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:47,780
You're my husband.

240
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,620
What's wrong with giving me a kiss?

241
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,980
