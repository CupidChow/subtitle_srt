Madam, we're in trouble.

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,340
The herb garden is on fire.

26
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,900
Mom!

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,549
- There's nothing left!
- Mom!

00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,860
There's nothing left!

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,780
There's nothing left!

30
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,149
Mom, I've already lost Dad.

31
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,939
I can't afford to lose you again!

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,900
Everything's gone!

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,900
Everything's gone!

34
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,179
The herb garden your father
has left behind for us is gone!

35
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:05,989
Even so, we can grow them again.

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,460
Mom, everything will get better.

37
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,139
Everything will get better?

38
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:18,379
Everything will get better.

39
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,900
Mom.

40
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,180
Mom?

41
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,180
Mom?

42
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,259
Mom!

43
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,139
Mom?

44
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,020
Mom!

45
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,180
It's all my fault.

46
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,740
Mom wasn't doing good

47
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,379
after Dad's passing.

48
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,549
The herb garden was the last thing

49
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,099
that connected us to Dad.

50
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,020
But I failed to protect it.

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,900
In the end, Mom, she...

52
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,580
It's not your fault.

53
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,419
It's all Yi An's fault.

54
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,379
Yi An?

55
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,379
This is the CEO of Yi Yuan Group.

56
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,979
I've done my research.

57
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,900
She wanted the recipe for Bazhen Cake.

58
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,939
But your mother wasn't willing
to give it to her.

59
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,460
That's why she fabricated this incident
and smeared Bazhen Cake's reputation on purpose.

60
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,419
She forced your mother to...

61
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,659
Yi An, I'm going to make her pay.

62
00:03:58,749 --> 00:03:59,869
But now, there's no way

63
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,460
we can go against Yi Yuan Group.

64
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:07,149
We have to lay low for now.

65
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,060
Okay.

66
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:09,340
Ten years.

67
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:12,379
In ten years,
I'll make Yi An and Yi Yuan Group

68
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:15,139
pay for what they've done.

69
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,419
Mom, I'm sorry.

70
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,179
I'm feeling a bit shaken.

71
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,900
But don't worry.

72
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,539
I'll definitely avenge you.

73
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,979
Although Yi An is gone, I'll make sure
Yi Yuan Group pays the price.

74
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,429
Hello?

75
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,460
Ning.

76
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,659
Your grandfather had just passed away.

77
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,080
(Dear)

78
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,600
(Dear)

79
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:41,460
Ze.

80
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,440
(Dear)

81
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,460
I saw your mother's picture again

82
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,979
when I was packing my belongings.

83
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,900
If only she was still around.

84
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,859
Don't worry, Uncle.

85
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,460
I know what I have to do.

86
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,140
To me, Yi Ning is just a tool.

87
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:13,260
How's the contact with Qian Lei?

88
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,880
He's a typical money grubber.

89
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,680
He came to butter me up
right after hearing

90
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,440
that Shang Su Group
wanted to collaborate with us.

91
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,499
Let's proceed with the original plan.

92
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:23,789
Join Yi Yuan Group

93
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,948
as an investor of Shang Su Group.

94
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,659
I'll find an opportunity
to transfer Qian Lei's shares to you.

95
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,840
This way, we should be able
to secure the purchase of Yi Yuan Group.

96
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:33,499
To you,

97
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,940
the real variable should be Yi Ning.

98
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,340
To me,

99
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,220
I have nothing left to lose.

100
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,380
It's been tough on you all these years.

101
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,299
I'm sure your mother can feel

102
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,099
how deeply you care about her.

103
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,619
Thank you, Uncle.

104
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,700
Without you,

105
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,499
I would never know how to keep going.

106
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,099
We're a family.

107
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,380
I'll always look after you
and keep you company.

108
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,260
Mr. Shen!

109
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,340
Mr. Shen, you're finally back.

110
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,340
Something has happened to the family!

111
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,580
Mr. Yi...

112
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,820
Mr. Yi has passed away!

113
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,700
Where's Yi Ning?

114
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,268
I never saw Ms. Ning

115
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,979
after Mr. Yi's passing.

116
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,979
(I saw your mother's picture again)

117
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,388
(when I was packing my belongings.)

118
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,260
(If only she was still around.)

119
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,020
(Don't worry, Uncle.)

120
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,900
(I know what I have to do.)

121
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:13,179
(To me, Yi Ning is just a tool.)

122
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,229
She's amazing.

123
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,748
She can still come to work

124
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,668
without any issues even after
Mr. Yi's passing.

125
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,668
She even put on full makeup today.

126
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,520
I couldn't tell
that she was visibly upset.

127
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,869
She's cold-blooded and inhumane.

128
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,869
She's heartless.

129
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,668
Yi Yuan Group will be done for

130
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,820
if we have to work for someone like her.

131
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,748
Why don't you manage the company, then?

132
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,580
That's fine too.

133
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,508
Mr. Yan, that's not what I mean.

134
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:01,739
I...

135
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,619
Who knows who'll take charge
of Yi Yuan Group in the future?

136
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:23,739
Ning.

137
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,508
I've already reviewed
the design proposal.

138
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,388
I think this is pretty good.

139
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,499
Why don't we choose this?

140
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,739
You can take a few days off.

141
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,499
There are plenty of affairs to handle.

142
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,739
I can't afford to take a break.

143
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,309
Ning, I know that you can't accept

144
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,940
your grandfather's death.

145
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,739
You can cry if you wish to.

146
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,859
You don't need to pretend
in front of me.

147
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,460
That's exactly why

148
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,099
I need to stay strong.

149
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,748
Ms. Yi is busy.

150
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:01,388
Business owners like her
have plenty of spouses.

151
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:03,388
She has a good in-home husband like you.

152
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,309
She needs an artistic husband outside
to cultivate her taste.

153
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,619
You need to rest now.

154
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,099
I'll send you home.

155
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,388
What are you doing?

156
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:11,069
Listen to me.

157
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,379
I'm not leaving.

158
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,388
You're no match
for her childhood sweetheart.

159
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,859
Why don't you choose me...

160
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,428
Are these men blind?

161
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,700
Ri'an!

162
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:23,469
Let go of her.

163
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,989
Mr. Yan, please mind your conduct.

164
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,069
I'll look after my own wife.

165
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,580
You don't need to worry about her.

166
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:30,820
I'll send you home.

167
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,388
I promised Ning
that I would send her home.

168
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,028
How could we possibly trouble you?

169
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:36,628
After all, you're just her friend.

170
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,229
Even so, we shouldn't trouble you,

171
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,469
contract-signing husband.

172
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,829
Enough!

173
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,099
Can you two stop bothering me?

174
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:47,220
Ning.

175
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,499
Ever since her mother's passing,

176
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,660
she kept everything to herself.

177
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,499
She may look strong on the surface,

178
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,040
but she's more heartbroken
than anyone else inside.

179
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,859
I won't argue with you for Ning's sake.

180
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,120
But I'm worried that something
might happen to her.

181
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:05,739
Keep an eye on her in the future.

182
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,340
I told you already.
I would look after her.

183
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,259
You're really filial.

184
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,040
You're still in the mood to work
after your grandfather's passing.

185
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,560
So many people came to pay
their respects at the family funeral.

186
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,099
You didn't even show up.

187
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,379
All of them are just
shedding crocodile tears.

188
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,028
What's the point?

189
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,508
Why did Mr. Yi hand the company

190
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:37,099
to a cold-blooded person like you?

191
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:39,619
Yi Yuan Group is truly done for.

192
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,739
Our family is unfortunate indeed.

193
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,379
What's wrong? Are you starting
your performance soon?

194
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,480
(Next Episode)

195
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:04,899
Half of the Yi family is mine.

196
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,940
It's all thanks to your mother.

197
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,180
You still have the guts to mention her?

198
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:11,668
I'm thankful to her!

199
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:12,540
I!

200
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,420

201
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,019
