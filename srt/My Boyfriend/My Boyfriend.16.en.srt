Why don't you consider it?

Don't be with her. Be with me instead.

Can you give me Yi Yuan then?

please have some self-respect.

00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,970
Don't act like you've never seen a man.

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,169
Let me go!

23
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,009
Help!

24
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,410
Let me go!

25
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,490
Help!

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,059
- No! Don't come over!
- Jiang Wenwen.

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,410
I gave you face, did I?

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,250
You smashed the thing I gave him.

29
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,330
Jiang Wenwen!

30
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,929
Figure out
who is the owner of this house.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,259
- Wenwen. Open the door.
- Dad!

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,259
- Dad, save me!
- Yi Ning.

33
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,018
Dad.

34
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,690
Let her go. Open the door.

35
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,569
Open the door!

36
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,490
Wenwen, are you okay?

37
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,129
Dad.

38
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,490
Here. Take it slow.

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,050
Just wait and see.

40
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,738
Don't worry.

41
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,849
I will make Yi Ning pay the price.

42
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,939
Just wait and see.

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,969
Sooner or later my dad will make
the Qian family the owner of Yi Yuan.

44
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:31,249
I will then become a rich heiress.

45
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,570

this woman's background.

Boss.

48
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:39,898
Jiang Wenwen is Qian Lei

49
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,610
and Jiang Xinlian's biological daughter.

50
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,890
Got it.

51
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,379
Ning, don't you think

52
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,649
Qian Lei and Jiang Wenwen's relationship
is a bit strange?

53
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:53,649
Do you think Jiang Wenwen
is Qian Lei's illegitimate daughter?

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,080
(Does that mean
Qian Lei betrayed Mom a long time ago?)

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,778
Jiang Wenwen. Why has
the project cooperation with Fengyue

56
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,210
not made any progress?

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,649
She thinks our project is bad
and doesn't want to work with us.

58
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,490
Keep following up with her then.

59
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,409
Can't you do a job well?

60
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,409
Ms. Yi.

61
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,330
It's because your project
is not good enough.

62
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,890
How can you blame Wenwen?

63
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:33,089
You're really good
at putting the blame on others.

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,089
What if I can get Fengyue?

65
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:39,898
Even if you can get Fengyue,

66
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,578
the market prospects for this product
won't be optimistic.

67
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,498
Not to mention Fengyue's promotional fee

68
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,859
isn't a small amount.

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,689
The company has no more budget
for this quarter.

70
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:51,458
Ms. Yi, if you're that capable,

71
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,778
why don't you get more investors

72
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,178
for the company?

73
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:55,490
That's right.

74
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,210
Don't just spend money
to throw your weight around.

75
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,290
Do something practical for the company.

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,990

77
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,809

78

not to marry Qian Lei.

Don't be angry.

80
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,178
Drink some soup to cool down.

82
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,459
Mr. Su, trust me.

83
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,370
There's great potential in investing
in the domestic cola project.

84
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,049
Who's in there?

85
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,250
It's Mr. Su.

86
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,729
The investor I mentioned to you before.

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,370
Aren't you looking for investment
for a project too?

88
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,890
Why don't you talk to him?

89
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,659
Mr. Su, won't you consider it?

90
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,779
Our cooperation model is quite flexible.

91
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,339
Sorry, your project

92
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,058
differs from Shang Su's

93
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:50,370
- investment philosophy.
- Hurry.

94
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:52,010
We may have a chance to cooperate later.

95
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,969
Sure.

96
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:54,729
Mr. Su, please stay.

97
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,058
Mr. Su, are you interested

98
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,849
to consider Yi Yuan's project?

99
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,570
What's this?

100
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,370
This is Ning's new project.

101
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,539
If you're free, stay and chat.

102
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,089
I'll make two dishes for you.

103
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,289
You've already spoken.
I have no choice but make time.

104
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,130
Sit down.

105
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,498
Mr. Su, let me introduce briefly.

106
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,779
Yi Yuan has done market research.

107
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,178
Young people still prefer

108
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,130
distinctive Chinese pastries.

109
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,219
Combining elements
like packaging and product taste,

110
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,690
we decided to make...

111
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,110
(Project Book
of China-Chic Chinese Pastry)

112
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,659
I didn't expect
Yi Yuan's new project concept

113
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,210
to be so profound.

114
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,570
Are you interested?

115
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,618
If you're free tomorrow,

116
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:03,370
come to our company
to discuss the details.

117
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,640
No problem.

118
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,450
Food is here.

119
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,489
Thank you.

120
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,370
How was your conversation?

121
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,649
It's as you wish.

122
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,810
Drink the soup.

123
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,289
Mr. Su is here.

124
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,729
Take a look.

125
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,330
Yin Ning managed to find an investor.

126
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,818
I heard
she also got in touch with Fengyue.

127
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,680
They made an appointment
to meet tonight.

128
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,818
If she really succeeds,

129
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,849
we'll be embarrassed.

130
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,729
I won't let her succeed.

131
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,609
You really
don't need me to take you there?

132
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,649
No, it's fine.

133
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,210
Go ahead. Be careful.

134
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,770
Ning, the tire is broken.

135
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,770
What?

136
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,450
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

137
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,890

She's just struggling in vain.

167
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:50,299
I hereby announce
that the new tea beverage project

168
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,498
is put on hold
because Ms. Yi failed to secure

need to dress up when they go out?

174

What's going on?

175
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,219
Miss, I gave you an extra half hour.

176
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,530
How can you be late?

177
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:10,579
I don't know how other companies stand you.

You two know each other?

184
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,538
Of course, we're childhood friends.

185
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,769
Can't you tell?

186
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,040
Yi Ning, you fooled us.

187
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Are you treating
the company's projects as a joke?

188
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,170
Stop acting like you're my elder.

189
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,210
You brought the evidence
of your infidelity with you every day.

190
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:56,849
Qian Lei, are you and Jiang Wenwen
biological father and daughter?

191
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,990
(Qian Lei, Jiang Wenwen)

192
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,330
How dare you?

193
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,729
Do you remember
signing a prenuptial agreement

194
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,930
when you married into our family?

195
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,089
Qian Lei, hand over

196
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,410
all your shares in Yi Yuan today.

197
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,939
Get out of the company with your junk.

198
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,849
Otherwise, I don't mind forcing you.

199
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:33,979
Ms. Yi is so domineering.

200
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,450
Mr. Qian, what does she mean?

201
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,889
Say something.

202
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,810
Dad.

203
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,249
Shut up!

204
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,849
He hit her.

205
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,219
Dad, wait for me!

206
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,738
What's going on? Dad!

207
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:02,099
Alright, stop being mad.

208
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,089
The old leech is gone, right?

209
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,650
Be happy.

210
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,969
Smile.

(Scale and Structure Analysis,

212
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,089
Come in.

213
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,489
Ning, are you still not leaving?

214
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,258
I'm want to take a look

215
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,538
at the projects that Qian Lei
has handled over the years.

216
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,849
Given his appetite,
he must have embezzled quite a bit.

217
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,690
I'm going to make him pay me back.

218
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,330
You're so cool.

219
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,939
But I have a job tonight.

220
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,249
So I can't accompany you.

221
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,129
Alright.

222
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,410
Let me know when you get home.

223
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:45,579
Thank you.

224
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,258
Bye.

225
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,369
Bye bye.

Are you okay?

229
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,050
It's fake.

230
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,579
Why didn't you discuss

231
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,219
this kidnap charade with me beforehand?

232
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,729
It works well, but it's too risky.

233
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:27,418
Ze.

234
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:28,459
