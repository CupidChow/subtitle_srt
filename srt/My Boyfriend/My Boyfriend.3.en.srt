Nice body...

Kiss...

16
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,210
Why did I have a dream like that?

17
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:51,570
(Not bad.
He squeezed out the toothpaste for me.)

18
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,330
(He even wiped the faucet.)

19
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,210
(The water temperature is just right.)

20
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,529
Coffee?

21
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,058
You stayed up late last night.

22
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:17,969
You should have a light breakfast.

23
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,450
I ordered coffee for you.

24
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,249
You can have it
when you reach the company.

25
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,809
How thoughtful of you.

26
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,730
Just doing my part.

27
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,010
I'll be right back.

28
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,409
I'm full. I'm heading to the company.

29
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,770
I'll drive you.

30
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,609
Ning!

31
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,330
I have something to show you.

32
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,289
Follow me.

33
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,779
What a pretty washing machine!

34
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,058
You have sensitive skin.

35
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:48,270
So I studied the mechanisms
of various washing machines.

36
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,320
I found out that this washing machine
has a running water antifungal function,

37
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
so I bought it right away.

38
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,289
You're really thoughtful.

39
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,298
Leave your health

40
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,489
in my hands.

41
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,738
I have something else for you.

42
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:00,810
There's more?

43
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,120
You bought me those too?

44
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,240
This is a gift I bought for you
to celebrate your new job.

45
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,489
Double the gifts,
double the luck, right?

46
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,890
I'll help you put them on.

47
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,529
Do you like them?

48
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,529
You're very considerate.

49
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,058
Why did you give me shoes?

50
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,049
I hope that when you wear these shoes,

51
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,210
you'll walk the path you want to walk
and become the person you want to be.

52
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,729
I will.

53
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,409
Good luck.

54
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,859
I heard that Ms. Yi who's starting today

55
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,210
is a tough one.

56
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,099
It's going to be hard for us

57
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,459
from now on.

58
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,979
Look, she's not even here yet.

59
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,010
It's her way of establishing dominance.

60
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,169
Look. Ms. Yi is here.

61
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,930
Hello, everyone. I'm Yi Ning.

62
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,810
Starting today,
I'll be the president of Yi Yuan Group.

63
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,049
To ensure smooth cooperation,

64
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:31,529
I have a few rules.

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,899
Number one.

66
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,049
Eliminate the limit
on clock-in corrections.

67
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:36,210
Number two.

68
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,289
No tending to personal matters
during work hours.

69
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,289
Number three.

70
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,720
The company is severely overstaffed
with underperforming employees.

71
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,649
I have a list of those

72
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,289
who have seriously underperformed.

73
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,219
The company has decided
to terminate their employment.

74
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,370
I hope everyone takes this as a warning.

75
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,178
Also, sales of the classic Guilinggao
have been declining

76
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,938
for three consecutive quarters.

77
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,890
I'd like to know
who's in charge of this project.

78
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,049
You're really throwing
your weight around, Ms. Yi.

79
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:06,729
Wenwen.

80
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,529
Explain the current situation to her.

81
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,049
Ms. Yi.

82
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,618
This Guilinggao

83
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:16,250
is Yi Yuan's flagship product.

84
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,899
It's just that its current positioning

85
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,058
doesn't align
with young people's tastes.

86
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:21,779
So...

87
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,298
So you can't solve the problem,

88
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,920
and you're just going to let this project
keep wasting company resources?

89
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,049
No!

90
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,010
I...

91
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,138
Wenwen! Are you all right?

92
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,089
Are you okay?

93
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:33,729
Ms. Yi.

94
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,738
She's not in good health.

95
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,698
You don't have to be so aggressive.

96
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,498
If she's not well,
she should go home and rest.

97
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:40,920
What's the point of coming to work?

98
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,169
Ms. Yi.

99
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,409
Everyone here has made

100
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,138
significant contributions

101
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,779
to the company's growth.

102
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,849
You don't need to be this harsh.

103
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,818
Take Wen outside to rest.

104
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,539
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,099
Come on.

106
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,930
Easy there.

107
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,250
Be careful.

108
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,779
My head...

109
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,610
- I feel lightheaded...
- Slowly.

110
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,620
I heard you scolded
Jiang Wenwen so harshly she fainted.

111
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,890
Rumors sure spread fast.

112
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,130
Ning.

113
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,250
The shareholders are all waiting
to see you fail.

114
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,738
If you keep charging ahead recklessly,

115
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,010
you'll easily fall behind.

116
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,649
You should focus on winning them over
and stabilizing things first.

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,419
Qian Lei has deep roots in the company.

118
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,618
If I'm not tough,

119
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,010
how am I going to get rid of him?

120
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,050
I'm not like you.

121
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,969
I don't have parents to rely on.

122
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,690
I can only depend on myself.

123
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,059
Ms. Yi An would be sad

124
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,138
if she saw you like this.

125
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,210
She wouldn't.

126
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,170
Instead of being a puppet daughter,

127
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,009
she'd probably rather see me
protect Yi Yuan.

128
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,129
True.

129
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,819
How are things going

130
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,849
with that Kept Man Shen?

131
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,609
"Kept Man Shen"?

132
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,618
Since when did you start

133
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:06,210
giving people nicknames?

134
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't you think it suits him perfectly?

135
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,606
No.

136
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,240
He's been good to me.

137
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,410
Of course he is. He's living off you.

138
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:16,570
What?

139
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,188
I said

140
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,824
you look pretty today.

141
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:24,170
He's here. I'll be going now.

142
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,330
Take care of yourself.

143
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:34,573
What do you want to eat tonight?

144
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,240
Nothing. I don't have an appetite.

145
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:39,437
Emotions are felt in the gut.

146
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:41,146
You have to take care of your stomach

147
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,480
to maintain
a stable emotional state for work.

148
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,480
Fine. Can't argue with you.

149
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,293
Might I have a chance

150
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,920
to taste Chef Shen's cooking?

151
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:56,450
- Sure.
- Sorry.

152
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:59,129
I only cook for my wife for free.

153
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,877
If you want to eat,

154
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:02,339
book a table at my restaurant.

155
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,459
You sure know how to raise your value.

156
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,335
How else would I handle

157
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:07,290
your scheming intentions?

158
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:16,450
Did you apply the ointment?

159
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,170
See you, Mr. Yan.

160
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,138
You're good at marking your territory.

161
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,489
Just as I should.

162
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,009
Kept man!

163
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:06,969
Has anyone ever told you

164
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,489
that you look very homey when you cook?

165
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,690
Really?

166
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,009
Why are you staring at me like that?

167
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,138
I want to see

168
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,658
what kind of magical husband I've found.

169
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,609
Good-looking and a great cook.

170
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,729
Pass me some salt.

171
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,969
Is this enough?

172
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:34,889
Touch your earlobe!

173
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,650
Still hot?

174
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,450
Yes.

175
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,570
I'll get some medicine for you.

176
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,889
Sorry.

177
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,889
I'll get it myself.

178
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,729
Smells great in here, Chef Shen.

179
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,658
You sure have a way with words
with women.

180
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,898
Did you need something?

181
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,650
Go find out Yi Ning's next steps.

182
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,609
Don't let her get in my way.

183
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,290
Gongbao chicken. Continue.

184
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,889
(I'd like to see if Shen Qianze)

185
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,089
(will follow Qian Lei's orders)

186
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,330
(and sneak a look at my project plan.)

187
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,969
Shen Qianze, what are you doing?

188
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,418
I saw you fell asleep,

189
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,570
so I wanted to put
the project plan away.

190
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:37,889
I'll put it away, then.

191
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,570
Let's sleep.

192
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:08,089
(21:00, Yi Ning washes up.)

193
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,650
What's wrong?

194
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,369
You look flustered.

195
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,179
I'm just not used

196
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,769
to our married life yet.

197
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,249
What's the matter?

198
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,930
Shy? You're blushing.

199
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:46,249
Shen Qianze, we're legally married.

200
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,769
There's nothing you can't see.

201
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:56,810
And...

202
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,609
there's nothing I can't see either.

203
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,150
(Yi Ning's Daily Habits)

204
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,930
I didn't expect you
to care about me so much.

205
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,618
You even remember exactly
when I drink water

206
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,129
and at what temperature.

207
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:31,769
I'm your husband. It's my job to know.

208
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,489
You're doing great.

209
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,050
But there's no need
to keep doing it anymore.

210
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,489
It's been so long.

211
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:02,969
Why haven't you found
any useful information?

212
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,450
I'm trying my best.

213
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,898
Do you think that just because
you've latched onto Yi Ning,

214
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,930
I can't do anything to you?

215
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,459
Let me tell you something.

216
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,258
I can get you into the Yi family,

217
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:15,979
and I can also replace you.

218
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,729
Don't get upset, Mr. Qian.

219
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,459
I wouldn't dare go against you.

220
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,129
My abilities are just limited.

221
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,170
I think you just need a firm reminder.

222
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,170
Ning! What are you doing here?

223
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,418
(Next Episode)

224
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:42,450
Look at this, Ning.

225
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:44,080
Shen Qianze isn't innocent.

226
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,369
His relationship with Su Jingxuan
from Shang Su Group is anything but ordinary.

227
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,410
If it weren't for Ning,
I would have dealt with you already!

228
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,898
