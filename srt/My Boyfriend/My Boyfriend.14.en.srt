(I Like You)

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,860
What gives him the right
to leave like that?

15
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,211
He went overboard.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,780
Don't tell me he's jealous of Ri'an?

17
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:56,731
Is he angry
that I'm letting Ri'an stay with us?

18
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,491
Why don't I coax him?

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,980
Why should you coax him?

20
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:09,411
You're the one being dumped.

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,290
You're being infatuated
if you go and coax him now.

22
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,411
No. I have to show him
the cold shoulders for now.

23
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:31,611
Ze.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,290
Ze?

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,450
Are you awake? Go and have breakfast.

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,650
Come.

27
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:45,730
That's a lot.
Did you make them yourself?

28
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,491
I bought them.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,691
The coffee is freshly brewed. Try it.

30
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:52,491
Ze said I shouldn't take coffee.

31
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,379
I'm missing him again.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,971
It's fine. I've prepared
some soy milk as well. Wait a moment.

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,179
Ri'an, spare yourself from the trouble.

34
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,179
I'm not eating. I'll head to work first.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,051
I'll be done in a second.

36
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:28,491
I'm here to pick you up.

37
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,930
Ning.

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,360
What are you doing here?

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,940
I know that you have the habit
of not bringing an umbrella with you.

40
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,370
Thank you.

41
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,491
Let's go.

42
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:51,291
My head hurts. Give me a massage.

43
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:12,380
It's you? I thought you were...

44
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:15,650
It's fine. I'm bad at massaging.

45
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,650
Perhaps I'm exhausted.

46
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:19,691
I'll go and take a break.

47
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:41,140
(Less alcohol, more water.
If you can't stand it,)

48
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,394
(take some honey water
to cure your hangover.)

49
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,671
(Do not kiss me casually
after taking alcohol.)

50
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,850
You don't want me to drink, huh?
You don't get to tell me what to do.

51
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:08,131
I'll drink again.

52
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,290
Why did you drink so much?

53
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,059
You're here. Let's drink together.

54
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,780
Now, no one is keeping me in check.

55
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,650
I'm going to finish all of them.

56
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,090
Be careful!

57
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,131
Let me take you to your room.

58
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:55,530
I'm not returning to my room.

59
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,571
I don't want to be alone.

60
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,691
You're not alone. I'm here for you.

61
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:05,530
I'll always stay by your side.

62

You'll always stay by my side, huh?

63
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,691
Yeah. I'll always stay by your side.

64
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:15,251
Ze, give me a kiss.

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,451
Give me a kiss.

66
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,331
You're truly drunk.

67
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,771
Come on. Let's go back.

68
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,811

69
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,580
Ze, you lied to me!

70
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:38,739
You said you wanted to be my family

71
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,251
and my shield.

72
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,691
But you left me just like that!

73
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,020
Enough already!

74
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,771

(Ning.)

(Good night.)

92
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,451
You're here.

93
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,619
Ning,

94
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,820
it's been over two decades

95
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:38,490
since we knew each other, right?

96
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,770
I was there with you
for most of the events in your life.

97
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,291
That's why

98
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:48,171
I thought we had more than
just the past and the present together.

99
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,250
I thought we could
have a future together.

100
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:54,419
But I never expected a stranger

101
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,060
to enter your world

102
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,811
and make me a stranger instead.

103
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,980
Ri'an, you're always been
a good friend of mine.

104
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:02,931
But I want to be more than your friend.

105
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,090
I truly wish to fight for my happiness.

106
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,539
But there are too many entangled interests
and social intricacies

107
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,739
between us.

108
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,730
We're too similar.

109
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,331
And, relationship
isn't the only thing in our lives.

110
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,811
There's no need for any
reckless abandon, don't you agree?

111
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,931
The relationship I desired

112
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:23,571
was a relationship
with someone who only had eyes for me

113
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,291
and would hold my hands forever.

114
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,240
As long as you're willing, I can give up
on everything for your sake

115
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,560
and love you wholeheartedly.

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,520
But I don't want you
to fall out with your father.

117
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:38,331
And,

118
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,051
I already have someone I fancy.

119
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,250
Ri'an.

120
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,651
We're still good friends, right?

121
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,970
So, are you sure
you don't want to reconsider it?

122
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,090
Okay.

123
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:03,571
If so, I'll return to my position.

124
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,331
By the way,

125
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,250
Shen Qianze's departure

126
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,899
might be caused by Qian Lei.

127
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,090
Qian Lei?

128
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,010
But I don't know the details.

129
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,130
Thank you. I know now.

130
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,820
(A Little Restaurant)

131
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,691
It's good for you
to leave the Yi family as well.

132
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:27,211
I'm always worried about
your safety there.

133
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,730
Let's plan this through.

134
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,730
We'll find a way to topple
Yi Yuan Group somehow.

135
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,180
Coincidentally, Qian Lei
came to coerce me into leaving.

136
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,850
I used his plan to my advantage.

137
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:36,739
As long as the reporters expose the news

138
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,379
that I was kicked out,

139
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,700
Yi Ning will surely
do something about it.

140
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,931
She'll have even more distrust
towards Qian Lei due to this.

141
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,451
Are you confident
that she's deeply in love with you?

142
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,490
Feelings are unreliable.

143
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,499
But interests
are pragmatic and reliable.

Do you think a person like that

147
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,811
can still be in charge of Yi Yuan Group?

148
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,379
Yi Ning will never allow

149
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,100
anyone or anything

150
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,291
to smear the reputation
of Yi Yuan Group.

151
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,931
You know her so well, huh?

152
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,171
What have you done to Shen Qianze?

153
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,220
I just made him realize

154
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,820
the position he was supposed to be in.

155
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:26,451

156
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,171

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,560
Are you sure these aren't rumors
fabricated by those women

183
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,280
because they're jealous
that he's my husband?

184
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,739
If he truly wanted to be a kept man,

185
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,531
why would he open a restaurant?

186
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,400
Do you think
I can't afford to support him?

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,850
So, does that mean there's no marital crisis
between you two?

188
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,490
We're doing great.
He's still my husband.

189
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,970
Hurry! Take a photo!

190
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:57,211
To hell with the contract. You're mine.

191
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,490
Take a photo!

192
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,531
Hurry and take a photo!

193
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,139
Hi, Mr. Su.

194
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,331
Great job, guys.
I appreciate your effort.

195
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:25,171
- Thank you, Mr. Su.
- Thank you, Mr. Su.

196
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,539
We'll make a move first.

197
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,060
Let's go.

198
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,651
Let's go.

199
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,619
Say that again.

200
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,139
Say what?

201
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,180
Say that you like me.

202
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,370
I like you.

203
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:51,411
I want to hear it again.

204
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,300
I like you.

205
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:53,370
Again.

206
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,610
I like you.

207
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:14,130
Here.

208
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:23,250
What are you doing?

209
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:25,490
I want you to try
if the porridge is nice.

210
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,850
Put them on the table for me.

211
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,571
Okay.

212
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,451
Be careful!

213
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,779
Wenwen, take a look.
I'll tell them to redecorate it for you

214
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,890
if you're unhappy with
any of the decorations.

215
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,211
Mr. Wen.

216
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,899
In the future, Xinlian and Wenwen

217
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,370
will live together with us.

218
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,931
Tell someone to clean up
the southern room.

219
00:14:57,001 --> 00:15:00,231
(Next Episode)

220
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,860
Is that kept man better than me?

221
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,060
Of course not.

222
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,080
- Of course you're better.
- Go and be together with him.

223
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,250
No way.

224
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:09,779
Don't be angry.

225
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,651
I'll apologize to you for it.

226
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:16,490
That's more like it.

227
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,010
Come on!

228
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,770
