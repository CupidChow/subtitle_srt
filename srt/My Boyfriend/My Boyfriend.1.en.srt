00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,049
If you're here for food,
you're more than welcome.

185
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,800
But, marriage shouldn't be
taken so lightly.

186
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,560
It's okay. Just think it over.

187
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,680
Oh, and next time you make
Spring's Delight...

188
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,300
(Yi Yuan Group, Yi Ning)

189
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,470
Be sure to let me know.

190
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,100
(Yi Yuan Group, Yi Ning)

191
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,089
Boss, why'd you turn her down?

192
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,239
It took me a lot of work

193
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,800
just to get your profile in there.

194
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,569
If it goes too smoothly,
it'll draw suspicion.

195
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,289
Ms. Yi isn't a fool.

196
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,350
I know you're playing hard to get.

197
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,040
Just don't get kicked out of the game.

198
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,320
She'll be back.

199
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,470
And not just her, others too.

200
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,599
I've checked the three candidates.

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,710
They all check out.

202
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,569
But what if she picks someone else?

203
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,689
What do we do?

204
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,359
Yeah.

205
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,520
We'll just make him one of us.

206
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,990
Nice!

207
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,280
- Cheers!
- Cheer!

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,440
That didn't take long.

209
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,710
You must be the new guy
Yi Ning picked to marry.

210
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,689
And you are...

211
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,230
I'm her father.

212
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,560
Yi Ning's been spoiled
and willful since she was little.

213
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,400
Now she suddenly says
she wants to get married.

214
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,710
I can't help but worry.

215
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,990
So, you came to see me today because...

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,990
I'm here to check you out for her.

217
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,200
She's already chosen you,

218
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,200
and I won't go against her wishes.

219
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,399
But, I hope that moving forward,

220
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,710
you'll keep me informed
of anything important.

221
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,119
It's only natural that a father wants

222
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,680
to know his daughter better.

223
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,879
If you behave yourself in the Yi family,

224
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,920
I can guarantee you wealth and status.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,110
The Yi family sure is complicated.

226
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,329
It's all just about interests.

227
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,449
But he didn't even
threaten you just now.

228
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,870
Why did you agree so easily?

229
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,809
Don't tell me you actually
want to join their game.

230
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,879
Qian Lei married into the Yi family,

231
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,049
and even after his wife died,

232
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,049
he still secured
the number two spot at Yi Yuan.

233
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,049
It's unwise to go head-to-head with him.

234
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,470
We'll have to play it slow.

235
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,160
Call her.

236
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,780
(Yi Yuan Group, Yi Ning)

237
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,710
And tell her you'll marry her?

238
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,590
Just say I'm treating her
to Spring's Delight.

239
