(When She Stops Loving You)

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,051
Boss, take your medicine.

15
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,010
Ms. Yi.

16
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:23,530
Don't you think you've gone too far?

17
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,780
You just left Boss
out in the rain like that?

18
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,920
Didn't you see him pass out?

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,880
He insisted on being in the rain
without an umbrella.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,939
Getting sick is his own fault.

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,260
Wasn't he trying to protect
the medicinal herbs you gave him?

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,570
Did I ask him to protect them?

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,060
Does he really expect me

24
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,459
to play along and be touched

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,659
by his whole tragic act?

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,891
You...

27
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,771
It's true that I was in the wrong first.

28
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,730
Ning is right to be angry.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,971
Ning.

30
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,570
You're here.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,930
We'll talk in the study.

32
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:58,411
Well, if it isn't Liar Shen.

33
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,500
You do look pathetic.

34
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,251
But it seems like no one cares anymore.

35
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,650
I realized something
over the past couple of days.

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,171
Whether it's the Bazhen Cake incident
from ten years ago or what's happening now,

37
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,810
there's only one person
who's benefited the most.

38
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,179
Su Jingxuan.

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,171
Correct.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,499
After you told me the real reason why
Shen Qianze wants to take revenge on Yi Yuan,

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,930
I dug into the Bazhen Cake incident.

42
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,011
Look.

43
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,059
All the media reports that influenced
public opinion at the time

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,130
all came from the same IP address.

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,690
You mean someone manipulated
public opinion back then.

46
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,331
If we can trace that IP address,

47
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:43,499
we might find evidence

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,339
of Su Jingxuan's crimes.

49
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,130
Yes.

50
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,211
Great.

51
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,370
What are you doing here?

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,970
I brought you guys some refreshments.

53
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,370
Didn't want you to get too tired.

54
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,930
Ning, you need to be careful
with your back.

55
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,250
Lean against this.

56
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,171
Put this behind your back.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,611
You'll feel better.

58
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,100
What's this?
Your little pity act didn't work,

59
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,579
so now you're trying to cozy up to me?

60
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,650
Sorry,

61
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,499
I'm not interested

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,970
in your body anymore.

63
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,899
If you're sick, stop hanging around me.

64
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,011
Go rest.

65
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,291
You still care about me, Ning.

66
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:33,739
We have important matters to discuss.

67
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,019
It's not for an outsider to hear.

68
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,619
Mr. Shen, if you're done here,

69
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,731
please leave.

70
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,130
Look at that.

71
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,051
That one.

72
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:01,311
(Li: I have the information.)

73
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,380
Boss, where are you going?

74
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:05,700
Put this on.

75
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,850
You're still stick.

76
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,930
Ning doesn't want me around.

77
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,211
I need to head to the office.

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,891
Leave this to them.

79
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,980
Well, Li?

80
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,170
What did you learn?

81
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:23,451
Ms. Yi and Mr. Qian once had

82
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:26,340
a huge argument
over the development of Bazhen Cake.

83
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:27,490
Everyone said

84
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,811
that Mr. Qian was worried
that Bazhen Cake would

85
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,420
take away resources
from other product lines at Yi Yuan.

86
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:35,131
That's why he kept trying
to block its development.

87
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,259
So Qian Lei didn't want Yi Yuan

88
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,011
to succeed with the Bazhen Cake project?

89
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:40,090
Yes.

90
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,020
(I can't believe Qian Lei)

91
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,691
(was involved even back then.)

92
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,040
(Qian Lei still hasn't been
brought to justice.)

93
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,211
(Uncle might have had a hand
in helping him.)

94
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,331
(Were they already
working together back then?)

95
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,299
Got it, Li.

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Keep this to yourself for now.

97
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,059
I'll handle it.

98
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,891
Yes, sir.

99
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,730
Unit 1-302.

100
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,100
Is this the place?

101
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,451
Doesn't look like it.

102
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:08,451
There's no sign.

103
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:14,160
Zhou Jian, you shouldn't have pretended
to be rich if you didn't have money!

104
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,100
I'm telling you.

105
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:17,660
You better pay me back today!
Or I'll break your legs!

106
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,571
Stop!

107
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:19,819
Stay out of this.

108
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,720
- Stop, or I'll call the police!
- Get him!

109
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,340
- I'm calling the police.
- Get him!

110
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,251
If he owes a debt, he should repay it.

111
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,580
You stay out of this.

112
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,211
How much does he owe? I'll cover it.

113
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,251
Well, well, a living saint.

114
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,131
He owes me 3,000.

115
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,379
You're paying? Cash or transfer.

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,730
Transfer. I'll do it now.

117
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:39,571
Stop.

118
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,630
This is a warning, Zhou Jian.

119
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:44,172
If you try to freeload again,

120
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,931
I'll break your legs!

121
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,131
Let's go.

122
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,451
Zhou Jian.

123
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,650
You wrote that Bazhen Cake article
ten years ago, didn't you?

124
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,220
What do you guys want to know?

125
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,139
Why did you write it?

126
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,490
A woman died because of it.

127
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,132
Her suicide had nothing to do

128
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,571
with me.

129
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,318
I was just doing a job.

130
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,371
Who paid you?

131
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,610
I took the money and did the job.

132
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:25,290
I can't reveal my client's identity.

133
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,460
Are you going to talk or not?

134
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:27,530
30,000!

135
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,610
I'll tell you for 30,000.

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,290
- 30,000?
- That's my price!

137
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,730
Ri'an.

138
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:47,891
I'll talk.

139
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,850
Start talking.

140
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,131
All I know is his surname was Qian.

141
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,530
He looked like a businessman.

142
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,970
Is this the man?

143
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,610
Yes, that's the guy.

144
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:10,970
I never realized Qian Lei had turned
against my mom long ago.

145
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,170
That explains everything that happened.

146
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:15,571
At this point,

147
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,939
it's just karma.

148
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,100
After the kidnapping incident,

149
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,211
I had people tracking
Qian Lei's whereabouts.

150
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,650
But they've turned up nothing so far.

151
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,290
You've reminded me of something.

152
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,011
Secretary Liu.

153
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,331
Did you find what I asked for?

154
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,211
Good. Send me the address.

155
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:41,900
I traced Qian Lei's last known location

156
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,660
through Jiang Wenwen's
bank card transactions.

157
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,340
Let's go.

158
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:45,371
Let's go.

159
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,331
Mr. Su.

160
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,170
Ze, you're still here.

161
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,600
I need to figure out
how to improve the formula

162
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,090
to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

163
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,290
You don't need to worry with me around.

164
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,970
Just go for it.

165
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,970
Get some rest early.

166
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,060
Pack your things and leave tonight.

167
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:00,379
Shen Qianze is onto us.

168
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,610
We can't wait any longer.

169
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,580
I've prepared
the plane ticket and passport.

170
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:04,931
I'm heading over to you now.

Come back and be my good nephew.
