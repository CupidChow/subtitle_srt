(Be Patient, and the Storm Will Subside)

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,258
Wenwen, take a look.
If you're not satisfied,

15
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,210
I'll have someone
reinstall it for you later.

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,689
Mr. Wen.

17
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,530
Xinlian and Wenwen
will move in with us from now on.

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,059
Have someone clean up
the bedrooms in the south.

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,249
Let's see who dares.

20
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:06,410
No wonder
you're so arrogant in the company,

21
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,178
you have a backer.

22
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:12,610
Yi Ning,
I own half of this property too.

23
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,098
The old man is gone.

24
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:18,289
I'm the only male owner
of this property.

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,050
Who are you to disallow it?

26
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,339
I didn't expect some people
to occupy my house for so long

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,330
that they started thinking
they belong here.

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,738
Even if my mom raised a dog
for more than 20 years,

29
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:28,850
it would be tamed by now.

30
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,378
Yet she kept an ingrate like you.

31
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,818
Your mother has died for years.

32
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,539
Am I supposed
to stay chaste for her forever?

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,499
Ms. Yi, I think you're still too young.

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,658
There's no man

35
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,499
who will keep my chastity for a woman.

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,499
Let alone a dead woman.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,410
You...

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,378
What are you doing?

39
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,490
- Ning.
- Miss.

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,330
Ouch.

41
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,298
Get out!

42
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,859
Shen Qianze, mind your own business.

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,539
Mr. Wen.

44
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,139
Miss.

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,419
Send them away.
Outsiders are not welcome at home.

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,890
Let's see who dares to do so.

47
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,339
Isn't Shen Qianze also an outsider?

48
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,499
If you're kicking them out,

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,649
Shen Qianze should leave with them.

50
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,050
It's not worth arguing with them.
Let's go back.

51
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,980
Why are you standing there?
Keep on moving the things.

52
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,529
Move.

53
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,458
What's with the public display
of affection?

54
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,458
You injured your arm, not your leg.

55
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:25,809
Are you dying?

56
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,819
You should
lessen the salt in your cooking.

57
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,510
My blood vessels aren't in great,
so I can't eat food that's too salty.

58
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,089
Your tomatoes.

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,409
Cut them into smaller pieces.
They won't cook well if they're too big.

60
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:44,089
That's better.

61
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,809
Look at the shape you cut.

62
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,010
Your cutting skills are really bad.

63
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,369
How pretentious.

64
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,330
It tastes awful.

65
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,369
Let's eat.

66
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,330
Here.

67
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,610
I can't eat. It tastes awful.

68
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:43,649
Trash.

69
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,730
Are you going to let them be
and do nothing?

70
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,240
We should strike where it hurts the most.

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,570
Since they're under my nose,

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,490
I have to win with one strike.

73
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,539
Darling.

74
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,778
Let me show you
the huge house I live in now.

75
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,170
You can even see the sea.

76
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:03,929
Give me a minute.

77
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,219
What are you doing in broad daylight?

78
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,649
This moral decline stings the eye.

79
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,338
Honey, my shoulders are sore.

80
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,730
Your shoulders are sore?

81
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:20,250
It's ticklish. Kiss me.

82
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,570
Shameless. How shameless.

83
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,938
My head hurts.

84
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,049
What's wrong?

85
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,370
Lei, Yi Ning angered me so much
that I have a headache today.

86
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,099
Give me a massage, and I will be fine.

87
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,618
I'll ask Mr. Wen to accompany you
to the hospital tomorrow.

88
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,019
At our age,

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,810
we need to pay more attention
to minor issues.

90
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,099
I'm just tired.

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,298
My shoulder are a little sore too.

92
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,459
Can you just give me a massage?

93
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,729
You didn't do anything.
Why are you tired?

94
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,899
(Where did Yi Ning)

95
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,890
(find such a considerate man?)

96
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,529
(How come this man is all I got?)

97
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,419
Are you thinking about that, Xin?

98
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,779
No.

99
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,738
Today, I saw

100
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,659
how considerate
Shen Qianze is to Yi Ning

101
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,289
and got a little envious.

102
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,130
How can a freeloader compare to me?

103
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,570
Can he give you
houses, cars, bags, and jewelry?

104
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:32,890
(Women need to be
financially independent.)

105
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,779
Women are superficial.

106
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,339
Lei is still the best.

107
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,450
It's my fault.
I fell for Yi Ning's trap.

108
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,219
Don't be angry. I'll apologize.

109
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,659
How is the pretty boy better than me?

110
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,899
He's not as good as you.

111
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,810
- You're definitely better.
- Go be with him.

112
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,330
No.

113
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,770
Don't be angry.

114
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,099
Don't be angry.

115
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,770
I apologize.

116
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,250
That's more like it.

117
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,450
Xin.

118
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:08,529
Madam Wang.

119
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,649
Madam Wang. Do you know who touched
the marinated raw seafood in the refrigerator?

120
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,969
Who else could it be?

121
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,489
Since she likes it, she can eat more.

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,680
What's wrong, Madam Jiang?
Are you not feeling well?

123
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,219
That darn Madam Wang must have
not washed the vegetables properly.

124
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,899
She made me have diarrhea all night.

125
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,130
Your stomach is upset?

126
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,289
You shouldn't
eat things like that recklessly.

127
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,579
China root and lotus seed soup is cold.

128
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,780
You'll definitely have diarrhea
after drinking too much.

129
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,210
It's you.

130
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,729
You're responsible for your actions,
Madam Jiang.

131
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,849
Come in.

132
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,450
Ri'an.

133
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,498
I heard about your family.

134
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,089
Is there anything I can help you with?

135
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,089
Yes.

136
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,659
This is
our new product development proposal.

137
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,810
Give me some suggestions.

138
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,570
You want to ask Fengyue
to be the spokesperson?

139
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:20,770
What do you think?

140
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,169
She has always been very popular.

141
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,899
Her style also fits
Yi Yuan's new product

142
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,409
with Chinese-chic positioning.

143
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,370
She's a good choice.

144
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,210
I feel relieved when you say that.

145
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,938
You must help me later then.

146
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,618
Ning, don't worry.

147
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:38,330
I will help you at any time.

148
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,529
Thank you.

149
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,459
If you have no objection,

150
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,450
ask the legal team to draft
the spokesperson contract as soon as possible.

151
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,609
I will talk to Fengyue.

152
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,378
There's no problem in asking Fengyue.

153
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,529
But there's no need to trouble Ms. Yi

154
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:59,289
for a small matter
like discussing a cooperation.

155
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,770
What do you mean?

156
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:07,210
I declare that from today onward,

157
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,298
Jiang Wenwen from Marketing Department
is promoted to vice president.

158
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,979
She'll be responsible for new product
development and market research.

159
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,049
Let Jiang Wenwen ask Fengyue.

160
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,099
Ms. Yi, you should focus

161
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,859
on how to manage the company.

162
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,890
Mr. Qian, this is inappropriate.

163
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,579
This is a decision made
after consulting all the shareholders.

164
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,690
Mr. Yan also agreed.
Do you have any questions?

165
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,418
We'll do whatever you say then.

166
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,609
Jiang Wenwen.

167
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,729
I hope you don't disappoint everyone.

168
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,138
Ms. Yi, don't worry.

169
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,129
You're not the only one
in this company who's capable.

170
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,650
Mr. Yan.

171
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,719
I would like to ask you
to help me with this project.

172
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,050
Can you help me?

173
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,609
Let's talk about it
at tomorrow's meeting.

174
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,530
That won't work.

175
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,969
Look.

176
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,059
This is due next Monday.

177
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,299
Time is tight and the task is important.
Please help me.

178
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,650
You don't want me to perform too bad,
do you?

179
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,290
I promised Yi Ning
that I would help her.

180
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,299
But this project

181
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,378
is no longer Yi Ning's.

182
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,099
I have no obligation to help others.

183
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,969
You

184
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,450
should ask someone else.

185
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,969
(Why do everyone love you?)

186
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,410
(Yi Ning, wait and see.)

187
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,339
(I will take away)

188
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,609
(everything you have.)

189
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,849
Ouch.

190
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,299
I think I sprained my foot.

191
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,258
Qianze, I heard you're quite skilled.

192
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:21,930
Massage it for me.

193
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,530
Shen Qianze.

194
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,459
You're just a darn cook.

195
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,579
The Yi family and Yi Yuan will be mine.

196
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,369
What good will it do you to offend me?

197
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,729
Yi Yuan will be yours?

198
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,810
Of course.

199
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,699
I can also give you
what Yi Ning can offer you.

200
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,738
What do you think?
Why don't you consider it?

201
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,849
Don't be with her. Be with me instead.

202
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,849
Can you give me Yi Yuan then?

203
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,470
(Next Episode)

204
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:56,369
Don't worry.
I'll fix it for you in ten minutes.

205
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,570
Don't worry. Take your time.

206
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,690
Mr. Qian, what does she mean?

207
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,690
Say something.

208
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,089
