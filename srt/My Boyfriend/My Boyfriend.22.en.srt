(Everything Will Get Better)

00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,069
Why are you guys here?

15
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,960
Why are you here too?

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
We found out that Jiang Wenwen
often orders takeout from this place.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,019
I was following Su Jingxuan.

18
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,099
Looks like they really are connected.

19
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,539
Let's go.

20
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:34,980
You're still a step too late.

21
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:37,340
So you and Qian Lei were behind

22
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,980
those reports
on the Bazhen Cakes back then?

23
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,739
What do you think?

24
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,620
You let Qian Lei go

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,939
after he kidnapped Shen Qianze too.

26
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:54,260
You really killed my mom?

27
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,579
How could you do that
to your own sister?

28
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,500
Can you stop being so naive?

29
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,709
If it weren't for me,

30
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,760
would Shang Su Group
have grown into what it is today?

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,748
You're enjoying
all the benefits it brings you.

32
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,160
What right do you have to criticize me?

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
That doesn't excuse you
from hurting my mother!

34
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:24,659
I'm giving you one last chance.

35
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:27,281
Come back and be my good nephew

36
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:29,240
and the second-in-command
of Shang Su Group.

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,620
Stop clinging to the past.

38
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,220
Otherwise,

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,769
don't blame me
for turning my back on family.

40
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:17,419
Mom...

41
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,180
After all these years,
I've turned into a complete joke...

42
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,580
Ms. Ning.

43
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,379
Mr. Wen.

44
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,419
Do we still have any
of the Four Gentlemen Soup left

45
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,139
from tonight?

46
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,508
We have plenty of it left.

47
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:14,900
Are you hungry?

48
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,739
I'll go warm it up.

49
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:20,820
No.

50
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,499
I just think it'd be a waste

51
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,419
to throw it out.

52
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,059
And this, too.

53
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,700
All right. I'll warm it up.

54
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,859
Ze.

55
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,020
What's wrong?

56
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,109
Come. Taste this Four Gentlemen Soup

57
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,900
for me.

58
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,099
Careful, it's hot.

59
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,580
Take it slow.

60
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,020
How is it? Good?

61
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,340
It's good.

62
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,549
Don't cry, Ze.

63
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,140
Everything will get better.

64
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,659
Mom! Mom...

65
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,739
Mom...

66
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,140
Mom...

67
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,059
Yi An.

68
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,739
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,179
I didn't take good care of Yi Ning.

70
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,020
I let her down.

71
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,780
Don't worry.

72
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,499
I'll give Yi Yuan back to her.

73
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,539
I'll make up for everything
I've done wrong.

74
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,619
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

75
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,508
I just hope that your spirit
can watch over Yi Ning.

76
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,539
Keep her safe

77
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,419
and healthy.

78
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,659
Ning.

79
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,739
I'm not trying to run away.

80
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,580
I know.

81
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,179
You're going to find Qian Lei.

82
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,460
I'm going too.
We need to find the evidence.

83
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,340
I'll drive.

84
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,820
Are we here?

85
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,748
No. The car stalled.

86
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,299
But I can fix it.

87
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,979
Nice car you have there.

88
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,580
Classy.

89
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,428
Sir, do you know
how to get to Qian Family Village?

90
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:55,259
Qian Family Village?

91
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,660
It's about seven to eight miles
from here.

92
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,259
You'll be there soon.

93
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,019
Are you heading there
to look for someone?

94
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,469
I live in Qian Family Village.

95
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,869
Do you know Qian Lei?

96
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,229
Qian Lei?

97
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,940
Of course!

98
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,460
He was the first university graduate
from our village!

99
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,829
Made a fortune out there!

100
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,139
Built schools

101
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,060
and fixed the roads for us.

102
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,668
See this road? Qian Lei paid for it.

103
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:26,499
We never had such good roads before.

104
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,739
Come on. I'll take you to the village.

105
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,869
- Are we sure this is the same guy?
- Can we trust him?

106
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,580
We can't get signal here.

107
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,859
Come on! Follow me!

108
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,139
He's still better than the guy

109
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,469
who'd lock me up and keep me captive.

110
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,700
I'm sorry. I...

111
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,820
Come on!

112
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:54,379
We're here.

113
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,300
We have guests!

114
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,748
Coming!

115
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:00,748
Old man!

116
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:02,908
You're home late. What happened?

117
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,660
Ran into two guests on the way.

118
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,268
They said they're here for Lei.

119
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,388
- Come in.
- Father.

120
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,548
They're not trouble, are they?

121
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,739
Don't worry about it.

122
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,979
Come in, come in.

123
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,949
Come in, come in!

124
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,388
- Have a seat.
- Make yourselves comfortable.

125
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,268
Sit here.

126
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,698
- Sit down.
- Sit here.

127
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:21,090
Thank you.

128
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,576
I'll go get the chopsticks.

129
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,499
Join us for dinner.

130
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,694
Lei's house is still a bit of a walk
from here.

131
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:28,218
Here.

132
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,321
I'll take you guys there after dinner.

133
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,094
- Come. Eat up.
- Thank you, sir.

134
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:33,130
Thank you, sir.

135
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,940
Dig in!

136
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,220
You're good to your wife.

137
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,589
That's how a man should be.

138
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,739
Treat your wife well
and you'll be successful.

139
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,979
You're right.

140
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,069
We brew this liquor ourselves.

141
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,540
Not too strong, but it's really good.

142
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,940
Try it.

143
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,300
- Try it.
- It's good.

144
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,460
What are you looking for Lei for?

145
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,540
We're his colleagues.

146
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,099
From Yi Yuan.

147
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,060
We heard Qian Lei's hometown
has really good tea,

148
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,460
so we came to check it out.

149
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,580
Oh, you're his colleagues.

150
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:41,908
I see. That's good.

151
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,628
A toast to you guys!

152
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,619
Didn't Lei say he quit Yi Yuan already?

153
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:54,069
I raise a toast to Mr. Lei's colleagues.

154
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,899
Here.

155
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,739
Drink up.

156
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,619
Drink more.

157
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,379
Allow me to give you another toast.

158
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:05,956
Bottoms up!

159
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:06,603
Cheers!

160
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:08,428
Let's all have a drink together!

161
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,580
- Here, here.
- Together.

162
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,180
It's a special occasion.

163
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,428
Come!

164
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:14,748
- Drink more!
- Drink up!

165
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,428
- We brewed this liquor ourselves.
- Here.

166
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,668
- Fill it up!
- It's a special occasion.

167
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,619
- It's fate that we meet.
- Drink up!

168
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,580
Fill them up!

169
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:26,940
- It's very good.
- Drink!

170
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,940
- Bottoms up!
- Drink more.

171
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,420
Shen Qianze! Wake up!

172
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,700
Shen Qianze! Wake up!

173
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,028
I can't believe my luck!

174
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,820
I'm being held captive again.

175
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,180
Don't worry. I'll get you out of here.

176
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,220
Well, think of something!

177
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,180
What are you guys doing?

178
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,660
I don't want to die
in the middle of nowhere

179
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,739
with no one to collect my body.

180
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,099
I'll get you out of here.

181
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,779
I promised Grandpa

182
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,779
that I'd be your family for life.

183
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,259
So, I'll protect you
and take care of you.

184
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,899
Family?

185
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,820
The kind of family
that stabs you in the back,

186
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,139
lies to you, and steals from you?

187
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm sorry. I'll make up for it.

188
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,548
I'll make it up to you
with everything I have.

189
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,739
Stop talking.

190
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,859
Every word you say

191
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,739
just reminds me of everything
you did to me.

192
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,540
Ning.

193
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,660
There's one thing I didn't lie about.

194
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,660
When I said I fell in love with you,

195
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,300
I meant it.

196
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,508
If you still don't believe me,

197
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,109
then don't listen to what I say anymore.

198
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,420
Just watch what I do.

199
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm tired.

200
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,420
Here. Lean against me.

201
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,060
You'll feel better.

202
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:10,940
Father,
we can't just keep them locked up.

203
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,420
Silly boy!

204
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,220
We can't just let them go!

205
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:19,019
They ruined Lei's plans.

206
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,180
Let's just keep them locked in there.

207
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,499
That girl's pretty.

208
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,460
She can be Qiang's wife.

209
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,899
What do you want from us?

210
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,829
(Next Episode)

211
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,949
You only did it
because of your greedy ambitions!

212
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,139
What's wrong with having ambitions?

213
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,480
There are still a few things that need
to be amended in this contract.

214
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
You can amend them however you want.

215
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,960
