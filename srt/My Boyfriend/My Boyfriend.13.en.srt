(Three-Man Trip To The Old Manor)

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,210
It's all Ri'an's fault.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,739
But he forfeited his vote.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,410
It's not like he supported Yi Ning.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,658
The result isn't too bad.

18
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,249
She has to leave the company

19
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,898
as long as she doesn't hit the KPI.

20
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:57,889
Mr. Yan,

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,658
I've always thought of you

22
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,298
as my best business partner.

23
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,179
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,690
The benefits given to your family
are also the highest.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,250
Ri'an promised to help me out before.

26
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:11,160
How could he
turn his back on me like that?

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,419
- Yes. This time...
- I've never promised you anything.

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,619
And, I'll never harm Yi Ning.

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,089
What nonsense are you talking about?

30
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,210
I'll lecture him after this.

31
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,610
I'll make sure this won't happen again.

32
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:32,289
Dad, I don't think you should
get involved with him any longer.

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,859
If he can betray the Yi family,

34
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,480
he can betray our family in the future.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,840
You should withdraw yourself
from it as soon as possible.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,419
The collaboration between the Yan family

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,658
and Mr. Qian has long been
deeply intertwined.

38
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:42,929
It's too late to turn back now.

39
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,938
I know you like Yi Ning.

40
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,779
But our family cannot
go against Mr. Qian.

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,658
But if we...

42
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,009
What are you talking about?

43
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,419
If you get yourself
involved with Yi Ning again,

44
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,938
you better get out of my house!

45
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:57,859
But Dad...

46
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,089
Don't call me that.
I don't have a son like you.

47
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,330
Where are you going?

48
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,120
You better don't come back
after you leave!

49
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:10,570
Youngsters.

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,458
That's the gist of it.

51
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,819
So, I've been kicked out of the house.

52
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,738
Mr. Yan, you're the son
of a wealthy man.

53
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,338
You're a famous artist as well.

54
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,298
Don't tell me you don't even
have your own house?

55
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:27,178
Thank you for your praise,
but I don't have one.

56
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,570
He's speaking the truth.

57
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,979
He spent all of his money on tea leaves.

58
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,298
You do know me well.

59
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,529
After all, we've known each other
for over two decades.

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,409
You were implicated by my actions.

61
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,738
Why don't you live with us?

62
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:41,929
- Sure.
- That won't do.

63
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,699
Dear, we must help our friends
when they're in trouble.

64
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,730
You won't leave my friend
in the lurch, right?

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,618
Fine.

66
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:52,618
Since my wife already said so,

67
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,089
I'll follow her instructions.

68
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,578
Is your bank card frozen as well?

69
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,490
I have a bank card here.
You can have it first.

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,738
How could you give money

71
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,298
to another man in front of me?

72
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,969
But we're good friends.

73
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:18,170
Dear, you're the head of the family now.

74
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,649
Why don't you arrange a room for him?

75
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:25,659
Fine. I'm the head of the family.

76
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,490
I'll make the arrangements.

77
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,890
We'll take him in, then.

78
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,969
Thank you, Dear.

79
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,659
Your father is panicking at home,

80
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,730
but look at how laid-back you are.

81
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,969
My previous proposal still counts.

82
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,099
Get Yi Yuan Group for me,

83
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,010
and I'll get Yi Ning for you.

84
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,210
We're businessmen.
We seek a win-win situation.

85
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,849
I never do any business deals.

86
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,330
And, the biggest issue
obstructing me and Yi Ning

87
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,089
should be you.

88
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,330
You're too young indeed.
That's why you're inflexible.

89
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,360
As long as you're willing
to work together with me,

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,498
I can let you stay by Yi Ning's side

91
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:15,010
as her official spouse.

92
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,779
How do you think Shen Qianze

93
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,210
was able to marry into
her family in the first place?

94
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,169
Is he your man?

95
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,130
It doesn't seem like it.

96
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,210
It's hard to control a pawn
if he has no weak points.

97
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,298
There's no choice but to discard him.

98
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,979
Are you saying
that I have a weak point, then?

99
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,099
You cannot ignore
your family, which is the Yan family.

100
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,779
I've already left the family.

101
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,849
It's always better to have
an extra friend than an extra foe.

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,089
You can find me
once you've figured it out.

103
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,010
Your handwriting is pretty nice.

104
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,810
I haven't even started yet.

105
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:56,450
I'll use my own way

106
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,010
to stay by Yi Ning's side.

107
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:07,130
Ning, have you guys
changed the family cook?

108
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,010
The meal tastes
quite different than before.

109
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,938
Seems like our new cook

110
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,738
is pretty good at his job.

111
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:16,570
You can introduce him
to my family next time.

112
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,089
I'm the cook.

113
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,459
Mr. Yan, do you need me
to provide my services to you?

114
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,219
Sure.

115
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,378
We lack

116
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,289
a cook anyway.

117
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,579
Why don't you try my cooking first?

118
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,100
You can decide after determining
whether my food suits your taste or not.

119
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:33,010
This dish is spicy and delicious.

120
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:38,210
Try my signature dishes.

121
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,729
It's very spicy.

122
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,579
Ri'an, I remember

123
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,570
that you don't like spicy food.

124
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,570
Oh, you don't like spicy food?

125
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,938
I suppose your preferences
are different from Ning's.

126
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,660
You two shouldn't
eat together in the future.

127
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,618
It's fine. I can take spicy food now.

128
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:03,570
You can?

129
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,570
You should eat up, then.

130
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,979
The chili is the essence of the dish.

131
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,058
- You should eat up as well.
- You should eat it.

132
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:11,219
It's all yours.

133
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,698
- You should eat.
- You should eat too.

134
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,378
- You should eat.
- You should eat.

135
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,450
Enough!

136
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:20,489
Are you two eating or not?

137
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,058
What are you doing?

138
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,219
I'm reading a recipe book.

139
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,089
I'm studying some dishes
that are very spicy.

140
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,049
Is it nice?

141
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,618
Is it nicer than me?

142
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,930
No way. You look the best.

143
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,930
My hair is messy. Comb it for me.

144
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,289
Don't you feel like

145
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,649
it's hot in here?

146
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,302
I guess so.

147
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:34,110
(Home-Cooked Food)

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,529
Read your recipe book, then.

149
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,450
It cannot compare to you.

150
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,369
(Shen Qianze, you mustn't fall for her.)

151
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,969
(You must remember your mission.)

152
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,249
(I'm sure there's nothing spicy
for breakfast.)

153
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,170
Eat up.

154
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,290
(Spicy pepper soup?)

155
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,290
(You want to trick me again?
I won't fall for it.)

156
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,489
(What? The buns are spicy too?)

157
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,729
(You win this time.)

158
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:49,570
Ning,

159
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:53,210
it's been raining lately.
It's damp and humid.

160
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,609
You should have more spicy food.

161
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:56,089
You can take them with you.

162
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,690
Ri'an, I'll be making a move now.

163
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,050
Are you okay?

164
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:06,930
I'll make a move first.

165
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,530
Ning.

166
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,819
See you.

167
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,729
Goodbye.

168
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,369
Eat up.

169
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:36,459
Mr. Yan,

170
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,979
your hands are meant for drawing.

171
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,618
They aren't meant for cooking.

172
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:41,299
What about this?

173
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,579
Let me handle
the ingredients for you, okay?

174
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,410
Mr. Wen, it's fine.

175
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,810
Anyone can cook. I'll cook my own meals.

176
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,299
Are you sure about that?

177
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,369
Yeah.

178
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:52,378
What about this?
Just call me if you need anything.

179
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:53,729
Alright.

180
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,459
It's on fire!

181
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,290
Someone! It's on fire!

182
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,339
Mr. Yan, were you doing an experiment?

183
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,849
I didn't do it on purpose.

184
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,378
If you can't take spicy food,

185
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,859
just clean out the seeds
and stems from the chili peppers.

186
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,249
I can take spicy food.

187
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,969
Then slice it into thin strips.

188
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,249
How thin should a strip be?

189
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,729
That's about it.

190
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,059
It's so thick. That's not a strip.

191
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,290
Do you want to cut it or not?

192
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,410
Fine.

193
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:13,369
I...

194
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,939
Don't move.

195
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,018
My eyes hurt.

196
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,299
You cannot touch your eyes
when you're handling chili.

197
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,729
It'll make things worse.

198
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,299
It hurts so badly.

199
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,690
I'm speechless.

200
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,089
Don't move.

201
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,290
Lower your head.

202
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,129
It's only been eight hours since I left,

203
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,530
yet you guys are
this close already, huh?

204
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,819
Ning, you're back.

205
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,290
Dear, you're back.

206
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,018
I was planning to cook for you.

207
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,299
He was burning the kitchen down.

208
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,059
Do you want to see
the chili strips I prepared?

209
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,009
He made himself cry from cutting chili.

210
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,290
Dear, let me cook for you.

211
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,699
You do feel comfortable
calling her Dear, huh?

212
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,979
It's a shame
that it's a contractual relationship.

213
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,969
At most, you're considered a part-timer.

214
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,138
Speaking of which,
didn't you sign the contract

215
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,579
to make your grandfather rest at ease

216
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,600
so that you could inherit
Yi Yuan Group successfully?

217
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,099
Since everything has proceeded
according to plan,

218
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,650
does that mean

219
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,290
you can terminate
your contract with him?

220
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,650
You see...

221
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,538
You still have a choice.

222
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:33,769
You should consider it.

223
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,170
Part-timer.

224
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,570
Ri'an, don't say that.

225
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:50,249
Where's the eye drop?
I remember that it was here.

226
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,050
Thank you.

227
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,930
Youngster nowadays
love to trouble themselves.

228
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,258
As for my proposal,

229
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,410
- you...
- I refuse.

230
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,369
What about this?
I'll express my sincerity first.

231
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,849
What about making Shen Qianze
leave the Yi family?

232
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,609
I'll consider it.

233
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,769
I finally know now.

234
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,059
You didn't acquire any intel
even after so long.

235
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,459
So, you were just bluffing me.

236
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,819
Since we can't cooperate,

237
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,498
I have no choice but to kick you out.

238
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,650
What do you want?

239
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,099
Do you still remember
what Yi Ning had encountered

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,410
as the basement parking lot?

241
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,330
Ning!

242
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,339
Ning, are you okay?

243
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,450
I'm fine.

244
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,859
It was you indeed. I was right.

245
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,249
You're truly despicable.

246
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,849
Speak for yourself.

247
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,538
You're pretty skilled
at living off her as well.

248
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,690
Yi Ning is completely bewitched by you.

249
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,570
If your acting was true,

250
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,570
you better leave her
as soon as possible.

251
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,859
If not,

252
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,658
an injured hand
will be the least of your concern

253
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:03,939
next time.

254
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,690
Who do you think you are?

255
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,570
Where are you going?

256
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,410
Let's terminate the contract.

257
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,930
Wait.

258
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,290
I've never treated you
as a contract worker.

259
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,609
I don't want you to leave either.

260
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,969
After giving it some thought,
I think Ri'an is right.

261
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,778
Right now, I can't help you out at all.

262
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:37,170
I'm just a burden to you.

263
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,609
You should focus on
Yi Yuan Group's development.

264
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,609
I'm doing this for your sake.

265
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,550
(Next Episode)

266
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,099
You said you would become my family

267
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,609
and my shield.

268
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,530
But you left just like that.

269
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,050
Great job. I appreciate your effort.

270
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,658
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Su.

271
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,538
Thank you, Mr. Su.

272
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:26,658
We'll make a move first.

273
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:27,849
- Let's go.
