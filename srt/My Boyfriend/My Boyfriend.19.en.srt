I'll feed it to you.

Curse you!

17
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,244
Shen Qianze.

18
00:01:39,694 --> 00:01:41,443
If you hate the Yi family so much,

19
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:44,324
then why won't you let me go?

20
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,283
Out of sight, out of mind, right?

21
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,083
Because you're my wife.

22
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,404
I have to take care of you.

23
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:54,163
Why are we torturing each other?

24
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:56,604
How am I torturing you?

25
00:01:57,414 --> 00:02:00,764
I love you. I love you so much.

26
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,643
But I'm too scared to love you anymore.

27
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,884
But you said we're family, didn't you?

28
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:09,653
Since we're family,

29
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:11,523
I won't let you leave me.

30
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:16,324
Ning.

31
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:19,324
I have nothing left now.

32
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,444
Please don't leave me too, okay?

33
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,653
(Yan Ri'an)

34
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:33,093
Hello? Ri'an.

35
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:34,772
Hey, Ning. I'm waiting in the garage.

36
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:36,004
I'm coming now.

37
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,083
Ning.

38
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:44,693
I bribed the guards here.

39
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:46,724
I'll get you out, let's go.

40
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,444
It's okay, don't be scared. I'm here.

41
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,083
What are you doing?

42
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:01,612
Yi Ning, if you dare leave today,

43
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:03,292
I'll make Yi Yuan go bankrupt tomorrow.

44
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,643
How dare you?

45
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:07,004
Ri'an!

46
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:12,612
I'm sorry. You should go.

47
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:13,643
Ning!

48
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:28,884
Let go of me! Let me go!

49
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:33,923
Are you that desperate
to get away from me?

50
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,123
Shen Qianze,
why can't you just let me go?

51
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:45,444
Go ahead and do it.

52
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,123
I won't let you leave me.

53
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:14,284
Shen Qianze, I'm begging you.
Please let me go.

54
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,924
Let me go.

55
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,444
You can't do it.

56
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:25,004
You can't let me go either.

57
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,364
What is it, Boss?

58
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:37,244
Watch her. Don't let her
take a single step outside.

59
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,764
I'll pack up some things.

60
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:07,773
Boss, the lady can't go out,

61
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,764
but can we at least let the doctor in?

62
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:10,893
Doctor?

63
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,684
She seems to have a fever.

64
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:26,764
Boss.

65
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,453
I already sent the doctor off.

66
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,444
You've been at it all night.
Get some rest.

67
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,213
I told you to watch her.

68
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,004
And this is how you looked after her?

69
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,372
You're the one who pushed her this far.

70
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,853
Now you're blaming me?

71
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:41,004
Seriously.

72
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,320
What did the doctor say?

73
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,732
He said to give her the medicine
and observe for now.

74
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,804
If her fever goes down, she'll be fine.

75
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:04,444
Careful.

76
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,124
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:07,732
You're sick.

78
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,364
Where else would I be?

79
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,804
Since you're awake, take your medicine.

80
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,244
What if I don't take it?

81
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,444
Are you going to hurt me again?

82
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:23,684
Ning.

83
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:26,372
I just want you
to take good care of yourself.

84
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:28,043
I would never force you.

85
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:30,052
I was just a tool
for you to get Yi Yuan.

86
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,924
You're absolutely not a tool to me.

87
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:35,292
From the day I fell for you,

88
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:36,884
I had already lost.

89
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:39,492
I don't believe

90
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:41,283
a single word you say anymore.

91
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:45,124
I'm tired.
I'll take the medicine myself.

92
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:47,403
Please leave.

93
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,083
What is it, Boss?

94
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,884
Do you think I went too far with her?

95
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,483
I just wanted her to stay with me.

96
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:34,283
I get it. You want revenge
for your mother's death.

97
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,804
But, she's innocent.

98
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:42,684
Yeah. What did she ever do wrong?

99
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,764
Mom.

100
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,684
I worked so hard for so long, all for this day.

101
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:09,324
But now that I got what I wanted,
why does it hurt so much?

102
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,204
Why did you bring me here?

103
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:16,612
Don't you always come here

104
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,043
when you're feeling down?

105
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,283
I made scallion oil noodles
and Spring's Delight today.

106
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,843
Let's sit and have a good drink.

107
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:29,204
If none of that had happened,

108
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:33,003
you probably would've been
a good husband.

109
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,083
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,763
My Mom's misfortune
is not your burden to bear.

111
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:39,532
Let's drink like we mean it.

112
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,444
Alright.

113
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,093
Do you remember the first time

114
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,684
I found you here?

115
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,883
Back then,

116
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:03,843
I was still heartbroken
over Qian Lei betraying my mom.

117
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:06,003
And now look at me,

118
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:09,053
drinking with someone

119
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:10,723
who betrayed me.

120
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:19,492
What a joke.

121
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,492
Ning.

122
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,204
Let's not talk about the past.

123
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,363
Let's just drink.

124
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,723
Boss, about Ms. Yi...

125
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:41,324
You didn't leave.

126
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:45,372
If you can't hold your liquor,
don't try to act tough.

127
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,564
You're the kind of person

128
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:48,213
who can't be truly heartless,

129
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,044
so stop trying to be the villain.

130
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,684
Did you stay for me?

131
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:54,963
No. I stayed for my mom.

132
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:56,963
Until I uncover the truth,

133
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:58,933
I'm not going anywhere.

134
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,404
You really won't leave me?

135
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:02,603
That's right.

136
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:03,732
Then please,

137
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,684
don't keep me locked in this room.

138
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,813
I want to go out
and get to the bottom of this.

139
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,012
I can't rest until I do.

140
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,333
So you still don't trust me.

141
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:11,843
How can I trust you?

142
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:14,573
You were ready to judge my mom

143
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,083
just based on what Su Jingxuan said.

144
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:18,843
Shen Qianze, you know me.

145
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,853
I need to find the truth myself.

146
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,644
I owe that to my mom and to myself.

147
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,363
Alright, I promise.

148
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:29,204
But, I have to go with you.

149
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:36,693
I'll go distract him first.

150
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:38,083
Wait in the archives room.

151
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:39,164
Hello, Mr. Su.

152
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,173
Ze.

153
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:43,644
Uncle, what are you doing here?

154
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,924
We need to talk.
Let's go to your office.

155
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:47,883
Come on.

156
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:19,384
(Archives Room)

157
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:25,544
(Archives Room)

158
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:30,603
What is this about?

159
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:33,123
What will you do with Yi Yuan?

160
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,044
Stick to what we agreed on, of course.

161
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:36,532
Fire the entire management team.

162
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,333
Merge all operations into Shang Su.

163
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,524
You're dropping
the Yi Yuan brand completely?

164
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:41,483
Why?

165
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:44,483
Do I sense an objection?

166
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:47,213
Uncle, I want to use Yi Yuan
to make Bazhen Cake.

167
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:49,564
I was hoping
you could give Yi Yuan to me.

168
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:56,204
Look at you, Ze. All grown up now.

169
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:58,363
Even you are asking for power now.

170
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,532
Alright. Once you wrap things up here,

171
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,532
Yi Yuan will be yours.

172
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,083
I'll leave you be. I'll head back now.

173
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:18,324
What are you doing here?

174
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,644
Did you find anything?

175
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:27,012
Not yet. I just need a bit more time.

176
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:28,164
Let me help you.

177
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:31,404
Never mind.

178
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,612
You don't believe my mom was innocent.

179
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,003
That's true.
But, I still want to help you.

180
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:50,763
I found it.

181
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,723
Is this your mother's
Bazhen Cake recipe?

182
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:00,772
This was a proposal

183
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,772
that Yi Yuan temporarily put on hold.

184
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,652
It includes her marketing plan

185
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,044
and product development plan.

186
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,204
And at the bottom

187
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:08,853
is our letter of intent

188
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:10,524
to collaborate with Su Wanqiu.

189
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,003
The recipe you saw

190
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,453
was one Yi Yuan bought

191
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,573
legitimately from Su Wanqiu.

192
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,372
If we were planning to work with her,

193
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:22,333
why would we set up a poisoning scandal
that hurts our own interests?

194
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,772
Yi Yuan benefited the most
when Bazhen Cake got pulled.

195
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,093
This can't be a coincidence.

196
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:28,284
Shen Qianze, think carefully.

197
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:31,644
Who really stood
to gain the most from all this?

198
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:42,104
(Next Episode)

199
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,612
What if something goes wrong

200
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,204
with the project if you walk away now?

201
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,652
Save it, Mr. Shen. I'm done.

202
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,532
Working under an ungrateful jerk

203
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:50,843
gives me insomnia.
