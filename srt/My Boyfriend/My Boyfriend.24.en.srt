14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,389
I was wrong, Ning.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,918
I did approach you with a motive.

16
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,830
But I ended up falling in love
with you.

17
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:56,830
I know I can't ask for your forgiveness.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,389
But you can't just marry someone else.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,029
Liang Fengyue?

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,478
Excuse me, sir. We're having a shoot.

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,669
Here. Come here.

Cut! Nice one!

26
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,598
What's this? Where is Ning?

27
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,790
Poor thing,
you've got the wrong person.

28
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,350
But luckily, she heard it all.

29
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,389
I would never repeat the same mistake
and marry any man.

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,118
Ning, can you give me another chance?

31
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,710
I will never lie to you again.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,309
Some lunch boxes and apologies

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,029
in return of a chance, huh?

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,389
Do you find yourself too charismatic?

35
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,879
Or are you taking me lightly?

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,469
I don't mean it that way.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,910
I just want you to be happy.

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,790
I was quite happy

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,149
before I met you.

40
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,510
Like I said,

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,989
you just need to follow my lead.

42
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,080
(Marriage Agreement)

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,709
This is the revised agreement.

44
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,630
It contains everything I have.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,750
There's no way out for me now.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,190
I only have you.

47
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,530
(Marriage Agreement)

48
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,070
All right, that's all.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,030
Well, let me have a look.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,109
All of his belongings?

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,959
Looks like

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,078
he's being sincere this time.

53
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,389
Aren't you going to forgive him?

54
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,230
I don't know.

55
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,839
During a chess game,

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,230
a pawn is always sacrificed
once it crosses the river.

57
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,790
Yet, even so,

58
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,149
it wishes it could live.

59
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,709
See, you actually still fancy him.

60
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,590
But that's not everything about life.

61
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,630
There, there. Don't cry.

62
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,350
Oh, babe.

63
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,070
Ms. Yi.

64
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,798
You need to head to the herb garden

65
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,959
for an on-site inspection
of raw materials later.

66
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,638
The project lead from Shang Su Group
has already arrived.

67
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,910
Should we depart now?

68
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,839
Who's their project lead?

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,198
Their manager, Mr. Wu Xiaowei
has been in charge of

70
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,630
this Chinese pastry project.

71
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:00,078
Rest assured, I'll make sure

72
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,358
that jerk, Shen Qianze

73
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,030
stay away from Yi Yuan.

74
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,598
Thank you.

75
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,030
I'm just doing my job.

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,350
Here, Ms. Yi. Mind your step.

77
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,669
Please come in.

78
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,520
Why are you shutting the door?

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,350
What is this, Wu Xiaowei?

80
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,799
I have something important
to discuss with Secretary Liu.

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,200
- Take your time.
- What are you doing?

82
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,198
- Ms. Yi...
- Let's go.

83
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,278
Mind your own business.

84
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,309
What is that?

85
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,599
Come out.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,030
I know it's you.

87
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,350
Welcome to the strawberry farm
of our herb garden.

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,030
It's not our garden.

89
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,318
You gave me the seeds.

90
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,278
They're all natural and pollution-free,

91
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,360
making them the right choice
for the R&D of our Guilinggao.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,710
And above all,

93
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,030
you said you loved strawberries.

94
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,429
So I planted all these by myself.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,189
I came for an inspection.

96
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,189
Let's see
if your strawberries pass the test.

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,470
And I'm here to keep you company.

98
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,150
Tell me about it.

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,198
Did you know what I was thinking

100
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,040
when I was planting
these strawberries every day?

101
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:58,790
I was wondering if you'd eaten well,

102
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,509
slept well,

103
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,189
and

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,350
forgiven me.

105
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,270
Have you forgiven me?

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,509
There's one more thing. Wait for me.

107
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,629
Ning.

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,189
Where are you?

109
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,989
That's a lot of nice food!

110
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,669
He made them.

111
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,710
Who? Shen Qianze?

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,069
Are you back together?

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,359
Well, what's this?

114
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,590
Are you starting over with him?

115
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,651
I'm not sure yet.

116
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,259
Are you worried

117
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,030
he'd lie to you again?

118
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,230
I don't think he'd do that again.

119
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,549
It's just that

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,989
all of my loved ones are gone.

121
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,950
I dare not imagine being with him.

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,749
What would I do
if he too left me all of a sudden?

123
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,518
If so, starting from now,

124
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,150
just be with him
for the rest of your life.

125
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,710
For the rest of my life?

126
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,799
That only exists in TV shows.

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,999
You're an actress.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,509
So you should know this better than me.

129
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,758
If so, stop worrying about the future

130
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,950
and live in the moment.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,230
Live in the moment?

132
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,270
That's hard.

133
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,150
Ning, in my opinion,

134
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,359
it's because you love him so much.

135
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,198
That's why you've been so heartbroken.

136
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,479
But we can't just forget

137
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,629
about what happened.

138
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,599
A scar may not hurt.

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,869
But I'm not able to deceive myself.

140
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,069
How about this, Ning?

141
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,069
Give yourself and him

142
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,150
some time.

143
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,350
Time heals everything.

144
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,989
I hope so.

145
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,590
It's true.

146
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,119
Okay.

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,039

148
