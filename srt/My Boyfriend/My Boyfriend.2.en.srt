16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,419
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,259
I meant to treat you
to Spring's Delight.

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,050
I didn't expect it to end up like this.

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,560
Let me help you up.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,160
This has to be my stepfather's doing.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,000
I need to call the police.

22
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:50,130
We don't have any proof.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,050
Let me at least help you bandage it.

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,080
Where's the first aid kit?

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,640
Wait here

26
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,680
Marry me.

27
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,610
As long as you're with me,

28
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,240
I swear I won't let anyone hurt you.

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,640
Marriage isn't something to joke about.

30
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,490
Besides, it could get you in danger.

31
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,659
I need this marriage

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,050
to reclaim the inheritance
that's rightfully mine.

33
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,120
I can draft a prenup for us.

34
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,489
Once I've secured
my position at Yi Yuan,

35
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,800
you can walk away anytime.

36
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,240
You can also keep running
A Little Restaurant.

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,890
I actually wanted to discuss this again.

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,290
You bought it.

39
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,890
Think of it as my apology to you.

40
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,009
But marriage is still...

41
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,450
No "buts".

42
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,699
We can go over the details

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,920
later on.

44
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,770
So, yes or no?

45
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,890
Wei,

46
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,139
your greens are still
the freshest around.

47
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,419
Of course they are!

48
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,419
Not bad.

49
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,570
I heard your niece is
looking for a partner.

50
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,960
You're too young. Not a match.

51
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,419
No, not me. I wouldn't dare.

52
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,259
I was thinking I could help set her up

53
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,939
with the owner of A Little Restaurant.

54

(Personal Profile)

55
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,640
Look. He's a handsome, right?

56
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,490
Not bad. He seems decent.

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,680
- Slow down!
- Take it easy, will you?

58
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,960
Look at this.

59
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,640
Pick it up.

60
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,210
(Qian Lei, Deputy General Manager
of Yi Yuan Group)

61
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,570
I can guarantee you wealth and status.

62
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,040
(Even the fish are
just like the ones at home.)

63
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,779
(Spring's Delight?)

64
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,480
(Someone's still making this?)

65
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,010
Ri'an, you're back.

66
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,289
I'll be right back.

67
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,130
Okay.

68
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,960
Ning, you're still as beautiful as ever.

69
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,960
Why'd you suddenly get married?

70
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,330
I just found someone and went for it.

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,600
I thought the one by your side

72
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,640
would be me.

73
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,520
You're my best friend.

74
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,930
Ning.

75
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll always be here for you.

76
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,770
As long as you need me, I'll be there.

77
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,690
Let me introduce you.

78
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,480
This is my childhood friend, Yan Ri'an.

79
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,129
And this is my husband, Shen Qianze.

80
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,330
Hi, childhood friend.

81
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,930
I'll head out for now.

82
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,979
What brings you here?

83
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,489
You didn't eat anything this morning,

84
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,080
so I brought you something.

85
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,400
I haven't seen Ri'an in years.

86
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,810
I'll be more mindful of boundaries.

87
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,330
You'd better know those boundaries.

88
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,600
Here, try it.

89
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,600
Spring's Delight?

90
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,160
Don't you like it?

91
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,480
It's really good.

92
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,370
It tastes just like how my mom made it.

93
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,130
Glad to hear it.

94
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,289
If you like it,

95
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,010
I'll make it for you often.

96
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,480
Thanks.

97
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,129
Which of these two colors

98
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,640
do you think suits me better?

99
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,370
Forget it. A typical guy
never gets this stuff anyway.

100
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,080
This one's Slaying Pink.

101
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,690
And this is Cherry Red.

102
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,810
I think the pink suits you better.

103
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,600
Here, let me put it on for you.

104
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:20,450

107
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,130
I didn't expect you
to know about this stuff.

108
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,099
Back when I did
part-time jobs in college,

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,080
I actually worked in makeup sales.

110
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,930
What is this even for?

111
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm training to be
an excellent househusband.

112
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,400
Grandpa, this tea is for you.

113
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,520
Good girl.

114
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,400
The future of the Yi family
depends on you now.

115
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,050
Back then,

116
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,080
your mother wore
this same wedding dress.

117
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,050
If she could see this moment,

118
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,480
she'd be overjoyed.

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,690
Enjoy the tea, Grandpa.

120
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,170
You're a good kid too.

121
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,690
Since your parents
are no longer with us,

122
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,810
just treat this place
like your own home.

123
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,810
You and Ning
must take care of each other.

124
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:25,570
Don't worry.

125
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,410
I'll take good care of her.

126
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,480
Watch your steps.

127
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,930
All right.

128
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,880
Okay.

129
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,369
I'll go get you a pair of flats.

130
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,050
It's fine, I can do it myself.

131
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,299
I'll go with you.

132
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,810
It's really okay.

133
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,699
Wait, don't go yet. Come here.

134
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,810
Where are we going?

135
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,880
I heard you're a cook, Mr. Shen.

136
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,339
I really don't get it.

137
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,290
How did you manage
to land the Yi family's heiress.

138
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,690
Yes. I'm the one marrying up.

139
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,459
Ning is just a good person.

140
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,179
Miss Yi has a pretty
fiery temper, though.

141
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,699
As for you, Mr. Yi-Shen,

142
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,810
I doubt you're in for an easy ride.

143
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,760
Yi-Shen?

144
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,219
You married into the Yi family.

145
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,880
Of course you take her surname.

146
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,009
It just means we've taken on

147
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,330
different roles in this marriage.

148
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,760
She's career-focused,
so she handles that.

149
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,000
I enjoy cooking, so I handle the home.

150
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,210
"Yi-Shen" doesn't sound so bad.

151
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,219
You're a grown man.

152
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,450
How are you not mad at us
after we mocked you?

153
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,170
You're something else.

154
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,219
Well, of course he is.

155
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,459
My husband is handsome but humble,

156
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,369
financially independent, and ambitious.

157
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,489
Unlike the rest of you.

158
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,219
You're just sitting around gossiping.

159
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,529
He respects you

160
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,000
because you're my relatives,

161
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,410
And yet here you are.

162
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,480
Yi-Shen, huh?

163
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,240
The Qing dynasty has been gone
for over 100 years.

164
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,529
Today is my wedding with Shen Qianze.

165
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,720
If you're here to offer blessings, stay.

166
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,410
If you're here to throw insults,

167
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,529
there's the door.

168
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,600
No, we didn't mean it.

169
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,960
(What exactly is he trying to do?)

170
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,650
Your stepfather's watching.

171
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,840
Don't get the wrong idea.

172
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,000
If we're doing this,

173
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,880
let's make it convincing.

174
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,410
Ning, let's go get ready for bed.

175
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,120
Shameless.

176
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,210
Disgusting.

177
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,360
Ms. Yi, nice acting.

178
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,240
You could be an award-winning actress.

179
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,410
I learned from the best, Mr. Shen.

180
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,760
Thank you for standing up
for me at the reception.

181
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,299
But offending them

182
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,210
could affect you, right?

183
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,290
I offended them?

184
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,690
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

185
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,409
You really don't need
to take them to heart.

186
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,000
I didn't take a single word
they said seriously.

187
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,480
That's not right.

188
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,529
You're my husband now, Shen Qianze.

189
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,210
We're family.

190
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,960
I'll protect you.

191
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,450
And family comes with family rules.

192
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,690
Next, I'll explain
my daily routines to you.

193
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,840
Please make sure to follow them.

194
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,979
When you wash your hands,

195
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,450
follow the seven-step method.

196
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,530
That's the only way
to really get them clean.

197
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,840
You must always sit
on the toilet when using it.

198
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,609
You can only get
into bed after showering

199
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,880
and changing into pajamas.

200
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,840
Should we change the sheet tonight?

201
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,179
No eating in bed.

202
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,579
Once you bring your phone home,

203
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,650
you must wipe it down
with a disinfectant wipe.

204
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,859
Also...

205
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,530
I got the rest from Mr. Wen.

206
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,769
I got your full list

207
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,720
of lifestyle rules from him.

208
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,530
And as it happens,
I'm a clean freak too.

209
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,960
I can handle everything you need.

210
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,489
I wiped this suitcase inside and out.

211
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,000
I even cleaned the wheels.

212
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,939
Ms. Yi, it's time to rest.

213
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,720
Do you want me to run a bath?

214
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,330
No, I'll do it myself.

215
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,930
You can't sleep either?

216
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,480
What's on your mind?

217
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,210
I was thinking

218
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,880
maybe I should make something.

219
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,760
What I mean is

220
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,249
I didn't really eat much tonight.

221
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,530
I'm a little hungry.

222
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,290
I was thinking about breakfast.

223
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,979
Breakfast tomorrow?

224
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,840
Don't worry, I've got it covered.

225
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,960
Give me your hand.

226
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,099
This is the Shenmen acupoint.

227
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,129
If you can't fall asleep,

228
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,409
just massage this spot.

229
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,410
It helps with sleep.

230
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,810
Is Qian Lei watching again?

231
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,000
No.

232
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,330
I just want to do
what a husband is supposed to do.

233
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,930
Don't worry. I'm in great shape.

234
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,270
(Next Episode)

235
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,410
I'll be taking over
as CEO of Yi Yuan Group.

236
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,610
I'd like to know
who's in charge of this project?

237
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,609
If you're unwell, just go home and rest.

238
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,800
Don't come to work!

239
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,259
Mr. Qian, to what do I owe this visit?

240
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,280
Find out what Yi Ning plans to do next.

241
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,320
Don't let her get in my way.
