Right past the windmill is our new home!

Come on, let me take you there.

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,490
Hello.

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,178
Excuse me, wasn't this place
a herb garden?

20
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:23,059
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,499
Our resort has preserved as much
of the original herb garden as possible,

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,620
so every guest can experience

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,640
(Shang Su Group Sunshine Resort)
healing from nature.

24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,658
Is this resort owned by Shang Su Group?

25
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,779
Yes, don't worry.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,259
We guarantee top-notch service quality.

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,259
Thanks.

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,330
You're welcome.

29
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,130
Take a look.

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,378
This resort

31
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,120
(Shang Su Group Sunshine Resort)
was built soon after your mother died.

32
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,130
What a joke.

33
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,929
The best liar of all

34
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,449
turned out to be the one
most easily fooled.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,050
Shen Qianze, you're truly pathetic.

36
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,970
Do you remember asking me

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,369
what I'd do if you ever lied to me?

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,570
Well, if one day
you found out I lied to you,

39
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,210
would you still stay?

40
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,089
If it's love, it's forgivable.

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,290
If it's about money?
That's the end of us.

42
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,249
Listen.

43
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,529
Let's never see each other again.

44
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,610
Don't go.

45
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,610
Shen Qianze.

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,129
You're not in any position to stop me!

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,409
Listen carefully.
I don't want you anymore.

48
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,290
(Are you really planning
to just mope around forever?)

49
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,010
The real culprit

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,610
is still out there living free.

51
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:01,010
Who is it?

52
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:02,649
Yi An.

53
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,259
CEO of Yi Yuan Group.

54
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,089
She couldn't stand the thought
of Bazhen Cake

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,529
taking over the pastry market.

56
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:11,490
So, she stirred up this whole scandal.

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,890
(All the negative press)

58
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,089
(was pointed to your mom.)

59
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,730
Mr. Su, may I know

60
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:30,178
why my family's herb garden

61
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,770
ended up becoming
a Shang Su Group resort?

62
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,929
That herb garden?

63
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,809
You know how it was.

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,458
Back then, that area was
nearly burned to the ground.

65
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:43,939
I was worried it'd bring up

66
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,770
painful memories, so I had it rebuilt.

67
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,929
Why did you go there?

68
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:50,010
I dreamed of my mom last night.

69
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:51,610
So, I wanted to visit.

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,730
If your mother knew
what you've done for her,

71
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,610
she'd be so proud of you.

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,849
By the way, Uncle,

73
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,578
I'm almost done with things here.

74
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,450
I can return to Yi Yuan to take
over the Bazhen Cake project next week.

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,170
Sounds good.

76
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,050
I've already made
some rough plans for Yi Yuan.

77
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:14,200
The senior staff there
will be handled properly.

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,289
Once you're there,
someone will get you up to speed.

79
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,370
What do you mean?

80
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,360
You're going to fire the old employees?

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,169
Those who are too loyal to Yi Yuan

82
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,779
aren't useful to us.

83
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,659
That's not right.

84
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,618
They're the backbone of Yi Yuan.

85
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:27,539
Without them,
both the production line and R&D

86
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,130
could completely collapse.

87
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,130
I still need them
for the Bazhen Cake project.

88
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,169
If you insist,
then we'll do it your way.

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,899
But Ze, remember

90
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,089
that you're part of Shang Su.
You are my nephew,

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,969
not one of the Yi family.

92
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,370
Got it?

93
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:47,210
Of course.

94
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,938
Li, what's going on?

95
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:51,738
Calm down.

96
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:52,099
Yeah,

97
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,339
don't lose your temper.

98
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,938
They haven't finalized the layoff list yet.

99
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:55,979
Yeah. We're senior staff.

100
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,738
Leadership has changed, Zhang.

101
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,019
If we don't leave now,
we'll be kicked out anyway.

102
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,178
I won't wait to be humiliated.

103
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,859
Where are you going during work hours?

104
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,219
No need to worry, Mr. Shen.

105
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,099
I quit. Working for a backstabber

106
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,178
gives me insomnia.

107
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,409
Watch your mouth!

108
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,058
Do you even know
how hard the boss fought

109
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:12,210
to keep you guys?

110
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,690
Ungrateful.

111
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,419
Does that mean
we're not getting laid off?

112
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,409
That's right.

113
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:18,539
For now, everyone may

114
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,219
focus on finishing their current tasks.

115
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,450
Just do your jobs.

116
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,659
An act of false kindness.

117
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,099
Who knows what you're up to?

118
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm leaving!

119
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,339
Li!

120
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,370
Fine, but follow the proper process.

121
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:30,849
Come to my office.

122
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,690
Let's go.

123
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,690
- Calm down.
- Just calm down.

124
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,250
Take it easy.

125
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,659
Make it quick, Mr. Shen.

126
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,770
I've got things to do.

127
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,579
Li, if you walk away now,

128
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,219
aren't you

129
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,058
worried about your projects?

130
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,529
So what if there are problems?

131
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,099
Shang Su Group is a big company.

132
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,579
Can't you handle the small problems?

133
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,659
If something goes wrong
with Yi Yuan's project again,

134
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,370
the brand will be ruined for good.

135
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,779
How will you explain to Yi Ning?

136
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,849
What do you mean by that?

137
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,219
Is Ms. Yi coming back?

138
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,849
Don't you believe in her?

139
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,498
If you want her to come back
to a company

140
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,049
with no one left to help her,

141
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,010
(Resignation Form)
then fill this out.

142
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,489
But if you're willing to trust me,

143
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:17,979
go back to your post.

144
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,489
Do your job well.

145
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:21,570
I need you to look into something.

146
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,430
(Resignation Form)

147
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,010
This is the last time.

148
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,378
They ran hundreds of tests

149
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,698
on dozens

150
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,169
of random samples.

151
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,498
(Test Report)
Not a single sample

152
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:49,289
was found to have excessive bacteria.

153
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,729
There's nothing wrong
with Yi Yuan's product.

154
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,219
I knew it.

155
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,849
There couldn't be anything wrong.

156
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,738
Now all we need to do
is get that reviewer to clear things up.

157
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,489
Yi Yuan's reputation can be restored.

158
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,779
Let's go.

159
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,729
Come on.

160
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,810
Who is it?

161
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,890
Delivery.

162
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,529
What is it?

163
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,729
Wang, let's talk.

164
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:36,618
I don't know you.

165
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,099
Leave now!

166
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,899
You don't know us?

167
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,419
You dumped a load of dirt on our heads,
and now you pretend you don't know us?

168
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,618
That's a bit rich, isn't it?

169
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,089
You want to talk here,

170
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,649
or should we take this to the police?

171
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,210
Wang, looks like
you've taken quite a few gifts.

172
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,729
They were samples from the brand.
I used them for the video.

173
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,659
Alright, I'll cut to the chase.

174
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,498
We had our drinks
tested by a certified lab.

175
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:10,698
Yi Yuan's beverages

176
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,770
(Test Report)
have bacterial contamination.

177
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,330
So why did you say they did?

178
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,649
I tested your product
and found problems.

179
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,859
Am I not allowed to tell the truth?

180
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,370
You? Telling the truth?

181
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:23,979
Wang.

182
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,058
Your reputation's been tanking
for years now.

183
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,738
Probably because
you've taken black money

184
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,409
to pay off your gambling debts.

185
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,570
Ri'an, what if we gave his real address

186
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,699
to those loan sharks?

187
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,418
Good idea.

188
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,179
- What are you doing? Let go!
- You can't tell them!

189
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,179
- Let go!
- They'll kill me! They have no mercy!

190
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,650
Now you're scared, huh?

191
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,969
Fine. I won't tell them.

192
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:45,219
But, you have to admit
your review was fake.

193
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,339
No problem.

194
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,930
And tell me who put you up to this.

195
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,889
I can't tell you.

196
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,729
They'll kill me too.

197
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,249
Ms. Yi, I'm begging you.

198
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,969
Then, clear it up. Right now.

199
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,489
Right away.

200
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,050
Hi everyone, I'm the reviewer, Wang.

201
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,849
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,330
Due to a mistake in my review,

203
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,849
the results I published were inaccurate.

204
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,059
This caused serious damage

205
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,880
to the reputation of Yi Yuan Group.

206
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:27,099
(Reviewer Wang)

207
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,330
For this, I sincerely
apologize to Yi Yuan Group.

208
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:32,570
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,609
Here's my latest lab report.

210
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,050
According to this report,

211
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,369
every product from
Yi Yuan Group passed inspection.

212
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:42,859
They are safe for consumption.
I'm truly sorry.

213
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,819
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm not drinking that stuff anymore.

214
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,979
Who even knows what's true?

215
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,650
Either way, I'm not buying it again.

216
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,498
Yi Yuan used to be a good brand.

217
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,330
Too bad it's being run by a woman now.

218
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,059
What can some young girl even do?

219
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,729
This company's going down.

220
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,969
What kind of nonsense
are they even saying?

221
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,849
Why does no one care about the truth?

222
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:03,849
I should've known.

223
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,210
No one cares about the truth anymore.

224
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,369
People just want drama and gossip.

225
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,450
I failed to protect Yi Yuan.

226
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,969
Grandpa and Mom must be so disappointed.

227
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,969
Ning, this isn't your fault.

228
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,729
They were just too cunning.

229
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,969
And it's not over yet.

230
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,450
We still have a chance.

231
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,690
Really?

232
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:29,530
Really.

233
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,258
Ning.

234
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,210
This downpour came out of nowhere.

235
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,360
I was worried the herbs
you gave me would get soaked,

236
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,530
so I brought them inside.

237
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,369
Shen Qianze.

238
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,299
The whole heartfelt act wasn't enough?

239
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,849
Now you're pulling the pity card?

240
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,390
