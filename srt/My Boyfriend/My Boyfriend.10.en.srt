Pretty good.

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,280
There you are, Ze.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm here to deliver your supper.

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,721
I'm releasing a new product.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,810
And I've asked for Ri'an's help
with the design.

19
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:04,440
Check this out. What say you?

20
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,101
(Yi Yuan Guilinggao)

21
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:09,681
It's so-so.

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,560
You know nothing.

23
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,890
Master Ri'an's drawing
is certainly full of elegance.

24
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,209
A commoner like me

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,569
would never appreciate it.

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,890
Aren't we the target consumer group

27
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:22,720
for this new product?

28
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,481
You're right.

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,201
Thanks for reminding me.

30
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:28,569
I think our design
should be more down-to-earth.

31
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,440
Indeed.

32
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,041
Shall we revise it?

33
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,681
You should eat first.

34
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:37,560
Sure.

35
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,929
I didn't expect

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,369
a third party here.

37
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,640
So I only made two sets.

38
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,321
Should I let him have mine?

39
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:47,250
I'm not interested
in your ordinary cooking.

40
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:48,481
If so, let's dig in.

41
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:52,401
It's been a long day for you, Ri'an.

42
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,360
Have some.

43
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,681
Let's share the food, Ze.

44
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,241
Your arm is injured. Let me feed you.

45
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:18,441
Isn't it tasty?

46
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,321
Is it nice, Mr. Yan?

47
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,601
It's so-so.

48
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:29,481
You're unappreciative of good food.

49
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:30,360
You!

50
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,569
How unhealthy it is
to let Ning drink milk tea

51
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,650
in this late hour.

52
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:38,769
Ning, this Guilinggao with milk

53
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,810
is made with our Yi Yuan Guilinggao.

54
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,769
It's without additives,
making it a healthy choice.

55
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,850
Yi Yuan Guilinggao?

56
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:44,449
Yes.

57
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,640
I'll have another bite.

58
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:50,721
It's good for those like Mr. Yan

59
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,090
because it's cooling.

60
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:52,800
I...

61
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:57,690
I was worried

62
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,920
that you might not be

63
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,520
a good contract husband.

64
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,321
Looks like

65
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:06,881
you're quite professional.

66
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,800
Did you tell him
about our contract marriage?

67
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,277
Ri'an is one of us.

68
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,970
He won't tell a soul.

69
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:19,800
Yes, I am one of you.

70
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,850
Well, I'll head back and come up

71
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:30,441
with a down-to-earth design.

72
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,489
I thought Ri'an couldn't
help but suspect you.

73
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,410
Well, I didn't want him to ruin my plan

74
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,169
or bother you.

75
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,360
That's why I told him about it.

76
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,769
Don't be mad. You do know

77
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,240
that the contract is no longer valid.

78
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,441
I'm not mad.

79
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,161
If you're not mad, that means

80
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,640
you're jealous.

81
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,681
Here.

82
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:37,921
Is it nice?

83
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:45,786
Are you recovered?

84
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,321
I'm long recovered.

85
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,951
I've even made you
this longevity peach today.

86
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,049
I didn't know you cook.

87
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,520
Of course.

88
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,201
It's because Chef Qianze
has been a good instructor.

89
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:58,729
Grandpa, may you have a speedy recovery

90
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,450
after taking this longevity peach.

91
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:01,960
How kind of you two.

92
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,441
Thank you.

93
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,960
Shen.

94
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:10,520
Thank you for taking care of Ning

95
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:12,289
all this while.

96
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,001
With you by her side,

97
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,600
I'm relieved.

98
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:17,450
When I'm gone...

99
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,520
Grandpa!

100
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:23,121
Let me finish, Ning.

101
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,400
Shen.

102
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:29,330
I wasn't being stiff

103
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:32,561
when I told Ning to get married

104
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,881
before taking over the company.

105
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,520
I know her well.

106
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:43,001
All she has is this company,

107
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:45,650
which is the result
of her late mother's hard work.

108
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:47,729
Without someone to care about her

109
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,280
and being her harbor,

110
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,489
she'd end up

111
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,929
becoming a lone fighter.

112
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,121
I noticed that when she was with you,

113
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:01,450
she let down her guard.

114
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:02,640
Don't worry, Grandpa.

115
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:04,561
I will surely take good care of her.

116
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,840
Grandpa, you will live a long life.

117
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,729
May we all be blessed
with good health, okay?

118
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,960
Enough with this unhappy subject.

119
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:17,169
Everyone is waiting for us

120
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,960
out there.

121
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,681
Thank you for attending
my birthday banquet.

122
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,450
I'm old, so I'll make it a brief speech.

123
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,080
Just one thing.

124
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,369
Everyone.

125
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,400
I am going to make an announcement
on behalf of Mr. Yi.

126
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,970
Mr. Yi has decided

127
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:45,330
to transfer all of the shares
of Yi Yuan Group

128
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,770
as well as property

129
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,080
under his name

130
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,330
to Ms. Yi Ning.

131
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,369
Starting today,

132
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,410
Ms. Yi Ning shall be

133
00:06:56,411 --> 00:07:00,480
the new chairman
and CEO of Yi Yuan Group.

134
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,201
I'll leave Yi Yuan to you, Ning.

135
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,520
Yi Yuan has had a lot

136
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:32,201
to be where it is now.

137
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,881
So I hope you all can support Ning
in the future.

138
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,650
Especially you.

139
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:42,369
Please assist her well, Qian Lei.

140
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,480
Certainly.

141
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,080
I will assist Ning well

142
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,280
like how I did for Yi An.

143
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,001
Here, Ms. Yi.

144
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,720
Congratulations.

145
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,640
Let me toast to you, Ning.

146
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,249
Congratulation on taking over Yi Yuan!

147
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,441
Thank you, sir.

148
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,640
Don't drink too much.

149
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,001
It's okay.

150
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:32,480
Ning.

151
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,401
Ri'an!

152
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,009
Your dream has finally come true.

153
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,050
I'm so happy for you.

154
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,009
How joyful.

155
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,960
Drink up!

156
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:44,321
Don't drink it.

157
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,409
You do know what you do
when you are drunk.

158
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,570
You kiss whoever you see.

159
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,489
What do you mean?

160
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,330
Do you always drink together?

161
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,360
You too know
how she acts after drinking?

162
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,000
Give me a kiss.

163
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:06,369
Where are you going?

164
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,720
Of course
we're heading back to our room.

165
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,850
After all, we're husband and wife.

166
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,240
Yours is a mere contract marriage.

167
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:13,970
You'd better know your place.

168
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,201
You should do the same.

169
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,041
Childhood friend, huh?

170
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:19,921
I...

171
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,921
Childhood friend?

172
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,009
I've always thought

173
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,720
you're the most suitable
to be my son-in-law.

174
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,921
Well, if I let you marry Yi Ning...

175
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,840
What are you trying at?

176
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,401
We know what we want.

177
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,201
I'm aware you've always fancied Yi Ning.

178
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,810
I can help you win her over.

179
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:52,369
All you need to do

180
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,850
is take my side with your dad

181
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:55,360
using the shares you possess.

182
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,801
You do know I fancy Yi Ning.

183
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,600
What makes you think I will help you?

184
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,080
You should know this.

185
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:04,090
Though Yi Ning

186
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:06,321
is now the president of the company,

187
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,921
I have my way to make her leave.

188
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,529
However, I guarantee her safety

189
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,441
when that happens.

190
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,129
If you agree to help me,

191
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,801
I can do you a favor

192
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,760
by making her stay
by your side, unharmed.

193
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:32,120
Oh, right. She's just recovered
from her arm injury.

194
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:34,320
I wonder if she will end up
becoming a handicap

195
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,281
if she gets injured again.

196
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,840
Slowly. You've had too much to drink.

197
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,290
You're drunk.

198
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,641
I'll get you some soup.

199
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,561
Thank you, Ze.

200
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,840
Why are you thanking me?

201
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,720
Careful.

202
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,561
Now that I own Yi Yuan,

203
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:23,401
I can give you

204
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:26,489
whatever you want.

205
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,681
I just want you to have a good sleep.

206
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:30,161
Get down. I'll fetch you some soup.

207
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,801
I have a gift for you.

208
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,321
Close your eyes.

209
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,009
Close my eyes?

210
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,120
Yes.

211
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:42,850
Fine.

212
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:43,960
Turn around.

213
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,409
Careful.

214
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,000
Turn around.

215
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,921
What's this number?

216
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:52,760
One.

217
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,281
No peeking!

218
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,641
What's this?

219
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,521
Two.

220
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,609
No way. No peeking!

221
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,681
What's this?

222
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,000
I've closed my eyes.

223
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,760
No peeking, okay?

224
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,521
No cheating, okay?

225
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,000
No peeking, okay?

226
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:25,521
Here we are.

227
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,921
Open your eyes.

228
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,880
Do you like this gift?

229
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,720
I do.

230
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,570
I know

231
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:44,161
you never feel you belong here.

232
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,720
So I hope

233
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,041
you can see this
as your home after this.

234
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:53,240
Always use the toilet bowl.

235
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,609
Give it a try.

236
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,729
It's okay.

237
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,649
Come on.

238
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,960
This isn't the right time.

239
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:06,201
You've had too much to drink.
Go ahead and wash up.

240
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:11,281
Shall we do it together?

241
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:35,240
What are you doing this early morning?

242
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:37,729
Here's a gift for you.

243
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,880
I guess you love herbs.

244
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,480
You've had a lot of them
in your restaurant.

245
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,760
So I've got you some here.

246
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,240
Mom!

247
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,760
Do you like it?

248
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,401
(Rest assured, Uncle.)

249
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,080
(I know what to do.)

250
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:13,641
(Yi Ning is nothing but a pawn to me.)

251

And now it's gone!

256
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,930
You're no match for him.
After all, he's her childhood friend.

257
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,401
Why don't you consider me?

258
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,561
Ri'an!
