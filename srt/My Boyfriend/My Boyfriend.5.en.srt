(The Double Life

14
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,480
So, the files in the study
are that important?

15
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:30,801
Yeah.

16
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,040
Which is why we need to be cautious.

17
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:35,680
You're not being cautious
with me, are you?

18
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,801
Of course not.

19
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,315
We're married now.

20
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:40,721
Of course I trust you.

24
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:00,480
You really overthink things sometimes.

25
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:11,680
What are you doing?

26
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:15,241
Reading.

There are a lot of books
on herbs in the study.

I'm busy during the day,

29
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,560
so I read them tonight.

30
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,081
Just reading?

31
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,921
Yeah. What else would I be doing?

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,929
You're not suspecting me, are you?

33
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,400
No. You're welcome here anytime.

34
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,481
Forget it. I won't read anymore.

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,161
See if you can connect with them.

43
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,481
No problem.

44
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:39,810
Were you caught when you found

45
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:41,041
the lists?

46
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,721
No.

47
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,000
But I think Yi Ning might be
keeping an eye on me.

48
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:48,010
But because of what happened,

49
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,601
she wouldn't confront me.

50
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,520
Ze,

51
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,769
you need to be extra careful
in the Yi family.

53
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,841
nothing matters more than your safety.

54
00:04:57,774 --> 00:04:59,751
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:02,320
By the way,

56
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,289
I saw a name on the list.
It's Li Mingrui.

57
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,050
Isn't he

58
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,849
also on our appointment list?

59
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,801
Yeah, he booked lunch
with us next week.

60
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:37,010
Didn't expect such
a coincidence with Mr. Li.

61
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,281
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

62
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,640
Mr. Shen, don't be a stranger.

63
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:45,041
It's all about mutual benefits
for all of us.

64
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:46,371
You're right.

65
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,281
Mutual benefits.
May it bode well for us both.

66
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:59,760
(Isn't that the distributor
Yi Yuan has been working with?)

67
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,041
This tastes great.

68
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,570
Hello, Secretary Liu?

69
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:20,841
Look into a distributor
named Li Mingrui for me.

70
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,329
Prepare backup options
for all projects.

71
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,601
Something's off.

72
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,120
What brings you here?

73
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:30,890
I want you to meet someone.

74
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,760
Come on.

75
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,320
So, this is who you wanted me to meet?

76
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:39,440
That's right.

77
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,529
I was wondering
who could make Mr. Shen

78
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,880
rush out in such a hurry.

79
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:45,721
It was you, Ms. Yi.

80
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,690
We were just talking about you.

81
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,880
Me?

82
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,241
Yeah.

83
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,089
What? Mr. Shen didn't tell you?

84
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,370
You asked me for a favor.

85
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,880
It's not worth mentioning.

86
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:58,890
What was it?

87
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:01,640
Looks like Mr. Shen isn't one to brag.

88
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,969
Ms. Yi, if nothing else,

89
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,880
just based on his cooking skills,

90
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,930
I'd say we should definitely

91
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:09,760
keep working together.

92
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:13,241
So, you met with Mr. Li
just to help me out?

93
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,729
Ms. Yi,

94
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,649
you really did marry a great husband.

95
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,481
This is just what I should do.

96
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:23,161
(Should I have trusted him more?)

97
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,969
Mr. Li, see you
at the office tomorrow.

98
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,921
Sure, see you tomorrow.

99
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,880
Goodbye.

100
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,560
Let's go.

101
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,050
Why did you help me?

102
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:37,721
I happened to notice Mr. Li
was a customer of mine that day.

103
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,969
And knowing how things
have been at work,

104
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,120
I thought maybe
I could help in my own way.

105
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,640
You're not mad at me, are you?

106
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,640
No.

107
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,000
Forget it.

108
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,450
You should take this access card back.

109
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,490
Keeping it with me
just doesn't sit right.

110
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:57,281
I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.

111
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,320
Ever since my mom passed away,

112
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,760
it's been hard for me to trust people.

113
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:04,089
As you know,

114
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,409
Qian Lei's been vying for my position.

115
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,130
And Grandpa's bedridden.

116
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,529
I can only rely on myself.

117
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,841
So, I tend to be suspicious.

118
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,680
Please don't take it personally.

119
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:14,880
It's okay.

120
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:18,370
Even if you doubt me
thousands of times,

121
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:20,849
I'll always prove to you

122
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,440
that I'm always on your side.

123
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,520
Well played.

124
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,850
Wenwen, did you hear?

125
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:42,890
One of our partners

126
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,330
was about to terminate the contract.

127
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:46,280
But, Ms. Yi managed to turn it around.

128
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,730
She is certainly impressive.

129
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:50,160
But who knows what method she used?

130
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,850
Everyone, I have a new project.

131
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:03,481
If you're interested,
sign up with Secretary Liu.

132
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,561
What a coincidence.

133
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,250
I have a creative expo coming up too.

134
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,850
I also need a few helpers.

135
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:18,250
If anyone's interested,
feel free to reach out to me.

136
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:21,250
Of course,
if you'd rather join Ms. Yi's team,

137
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,760
I won't stop you.

138
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,841
So? Who are you thinking of joining?

139
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,721
I'm not sure yet.

140
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,809
Ms. Yi's supposed to be the future boss,

141
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,130
so it'd look bad not to join her.

142
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:44,569
But, we can't afford
to offend Mr. Qian, either.

143
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,400
Who says she will be
the next boss for sure?

144
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,409
Right now,
most of the clients and resources

145
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,241
are in Mr. Qian's hands.

146
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,970
No telling who'll come out
on top in the end.

147
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,800
You have a point.

148
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,330
What do you think?

149
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,449
Wenwen makes a lot of sense.

150
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,210
Yeah, she really does.

151
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,321
How about we all go to Mr. Qian's side?

152
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,330
Ms. Yi, no one signed up.

153
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,160
Got it, thanks for letting me know.

154
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,210
What about the proposal for Mr. Li?

155
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,721
It's due tomorrow.

156
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,961
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

157
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,210
You can head back.

158
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,441
All right, then.

159
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,040
Why do you work overtime every day?

160
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,330
What are you doing here?

161
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,529
I figured you skipped dinner,

162
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,800
so I brought you food.

163
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,241
Thanks.

164
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,120
No matter how busy you are,
you have to eat.

165
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,361
Here.

166
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:13,000
I made this porridge
just for you. Give it a try.

167
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:22,160
How is it?

168
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:30,250
I forgot I had a meeting.

169
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:31,321
