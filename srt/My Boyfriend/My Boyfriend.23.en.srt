Have you come around to it?

Is my good nephew back?

(Qian Lei's recording)

17
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,051
Su Jingxuan came to me

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,819
and said he'd hire someone

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,251
to smear both Bazhen Cake
and Su Wanqiu's reputations

20
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,980
on one condition.

21
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,320
I'd have to let him have part of
Yi Yuan Guilinggao's resources.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,819
Bazhen Cake was our competitor then.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,331
Of course I'd say yes to it.

24
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,700
Also, he hired those so-called victims

25
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:24,540
and gave your address to me

26
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,120
so that I'd bring those victims there
to ask for an explanation.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,010
He said he'd tarnish Bazhen Cake

28
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:30,290
until it shut down

29
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,340
regardless of the consequences.

30
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,010
Regardless of the consequences?

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,930
How could you say such a thing?

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,780
How could you harm your family?

33
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:40,411
She was your sister!

34
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,739
I knew it were you, Qian Lei!

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,691
What else do you want from me?

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,620
Thanks to you

37
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:49,691
that Yi Yuan is no longer mine.

38
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,530
I'd like to have a word with them, sir.

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,450
Sure.

40
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:01,411
I never thought they'd kidnap you.

41
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,379
Let me untie you.

42
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,131
- Don't come near!
- What are you doing?

43
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:06,650
- I'll untie you.
- What is this?

44
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:08,850
What exactly do you want?

45
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:12,410
Go away!

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,211
I'm planning to turn myself in
at the police station.

47
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:19,179
You will turn yourself in?

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,331
Go ahead! Now!

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,420
Wanqiu Foundation
was founded by your mom.

50
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:29,340
You still have the cheek
to be talking about her?

51
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,571
I managed to get out of this village

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,451
because of this foundation.

53
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:40,130
I'd always...

54
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,140
I'd always thought
of expressing my gratitude.

55
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,220
But I had no idea

56
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:46,051
who was running it.

57
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,211
The chief showed me

58
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,530
this picture just now.

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,339
I truly had no clue.

60
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,499
I'm an accomplice
behind my benefactor's death.

61
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,530
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,339
What's the use of saying sorry?

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,530
I'm sorry...

64
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,130
What about my mom?

65
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,579
Did she commit any crime?

66
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,051
Did she?

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,700
I've had enough of hiding myself.

68
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,179
I know not only will my action
get Xinlian and Wenwen into trouble,

69
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,090
but...

70
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,260
but also

71
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,211
the entire village.

72
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:21,779
I wasn't like this.

73
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,130
It's just that,

74
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,171
when I was climbing the ladder,

75
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,891
I slowly...

76
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,250
Ning.

77
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,291
I was wrong.

78
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:34,820
Mom...

79
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:36,820
I will expose everything I did

80
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,370
with Su Jingxuan.

81
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:40,611
But I'd like to request you

82
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,731
to not go after the villagers.

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,930
They were deceived by me.

84
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:48,090
I'm not injured, so I will let it slide.

85
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,211
However, the laws will decide

86
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,011
whether or not
they've committed a crime.

87
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,611
Thank you.

88
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,370
You idiot.

89
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,051
You are as stupid
as your mom who died young!

90
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,779
I kept asking her

91
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,140
to let me have the herb garden.

92
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,530
But she refused to give in.
What else could I have done?

93
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,100
As you can see,

94
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,410
that resort is doing so well!

95
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,460
I did all this for the sake of Su family

96
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:20,460
and Shang Su Group!

97
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,819
You didn't do this
for the sake of Su family!

98
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,059
You were just being wildly ambitious!

99
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,251
Was it my fault to be wildly ambitious?

100
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,699
You've been nothing but stupid!

101
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,771
Stupid!

102
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,931
The laws will judge you.

103
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,610
I didn't expect your mom
to be that mentally fragile.

104
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,650
She killed herself
over those mere words.

105
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,571
Did I make a mistake, Wanqiu?

106
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:13,009
(Due to malicious business competition,
Su Jingxuan and Qian Lei)

107
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,054
(violated multiple regulations with
severe circumstances and serious consequences.)

108
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:19,871
(They shall have all illegal gains confiscated
and face criminal penalties.)

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,691
Ning.

110
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,490
Ning!

111
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:43,259
Mr. Shen, Ms. Ning is not seeing you.

112
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,011
Don't come again.

113
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,460
Well, could you give it to her?

114
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:49,499
(Share Transfer Agreement)

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,850
I'd like to return Yi Yuan to her
in its entirety.

116
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,691
Sure.

117
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,610
Head back.

118
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,090
Okay.

119
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,011
Ms. Ning didn't have it.

120
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,931
Ms. Ning.

121
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,610
Here's another lunch box
from Shen Qianze.

122
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:00,211
Well...

123
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,050
Shen actually knows he was wrong.

124
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,410
Mr. Wen.

125
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,931
I'll think about it.

126
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,050
She took it.

127
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,331
Okay.

128
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,410
Boss.

129
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:32,499
Wasn't that Su Jingxuan

130
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,820
brought to justice?

131
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,820
With Shang Su Group in your hands now,

132
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:38,419
you've had your revenge and wealth.

133
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,691
Why are you still upset?

134
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:42,300
Money is happiness, huh?

135
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,770
Of course,
you're finally having a good life.

136
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,860
But I'd rather

137
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,970
be as penniless as I were.

138
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,291
Is that so?

139
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:55,220
I guess this Chinese pastry project

140
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:56,659
with Yi Yuan Group

141
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,370
is not going to happen, then.

142
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,850
It's been a while, Ning.
Have you been doing well?

143
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,970
Why are you here?

144
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,659
Judging from your attitude,

145
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,691
I think you're not interested
in this collaboration.

146
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,499
I thought...

147
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,940
You thought she'd see you?

148
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,840
Do you think rebuilding trust
is an easy feat?

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,960
You think you can manage it
with several lunch boxes?

150
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,760
How did you know
I've been sending her lunches?

151
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,490
Did you eat them all?

152
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,890
What kind of attitude is that?

153
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,770
I am Ning's best friend.

154
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,010
How is she doing lately?

155
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,010
I'm so thirsty.

156
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,490
Oh, my arm.

157
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,419
Ning has been

158
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,860
eating well,
well-clothed, and sleeping well.

159
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,770
She's been doing excellently.

160
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,779
Well, has she talked about me?

161
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,770
She wouldn't be doing well
if she did so.

162
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,770
Regarding this collaboration agreement,

163
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:41,739
there are a few parts to amend.

164
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,659
You make the call here.

165
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,259
Eighty percent of the profits
go to Yi Yuan.

166
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,899
Sure.

167
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,800
- We will be in charge of the design proposal.
- Sure.

168
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,100
The recipe is ours.

169
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:48,779
Sure.

170
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,539
Let me have Ning.

171
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,451
No way.

172
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:52,980
You sure know what you want, huh?

173
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,980
I don't own Yi Ning.

174
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:57,370
It's my place to let you have her.

175
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,010
Here's a kind reminder.

176
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,860
Ning is currently taking wedding photos
on the big lawn.

177
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:06,610
If you don't make your way there now,

178
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,411
you will truly lose your chance.

179
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:17,351
(Next Episode)

180
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,931
I dare not imagine being with him.

181
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:22,811
What would I do
if he too left me all of a sudden?

182
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,811
If so, starting from now,

183
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,720
just be with him
for the rest of your life.

184
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,850
For the rest of my life?

185
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,090
