It's all for Yi Yuan's sake.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,678
Guilinggao is the foundation
Yi Yuan was built on.

16
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,119
And you just cut it off like that?

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,199
That's betrayal.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,558
Exactly.

19
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:52,759
At this rate,

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,958
Yi Yuan's going down under your watch.

21
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:55,879
- Yeah.
- That's right.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,909
I understand.

23
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,799
Guilinggao was Yi Yuan's

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,269
very first product.

25
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,159
It means a lot to all of us.

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,879
But a business can't run on
nostalgia alone.

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,639
The Guilinggao line

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,478
has been running
at a heavy loss for a while now.

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,118
Cutting it is a necessary step
to stop the bleeding.

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,719
Stop the bleeding?

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,749
So you just toss us old folks aside?

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,595
- Exactly.
- Yeah!

33
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:17,639
- That's right!
- How are we supposed to live now?

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,678
Looks like there's some
valuable stuff in here.

35
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,159
Let's take it and sell it!

36
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,498
- Move it! Take it all out of here.
- What are you doing?

37
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:25,398
- What's going on?!
- Get out of the way! Move it!

38
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,819
- Move it all out!
- Get out of the way!

39
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:27,398

40
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,138
- Take it! All of it!
- Take everything she has!

41
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:30,189
Li!

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,238
Mr. Qian, thank goodness you're here!

43
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,230
Li.

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,270
Why don't we all calm down
and talk this through?

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,469
You're all longtime
employees of Yi Yuan.

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,678
We wouldn't just dismiss you.

47
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,109
That's not how things work.

48
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,230
Ms. Yi's still young and inexperienced.

49
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,309
Don't take it too personally.

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,559
The Guilinggao product line
isn't going anywhere.

51
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,958
It's definitely...

52
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,910
Jiang.

53
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,038
Weren't you the one
managing the Guilinggao line?

54
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,719
Go have some tea
with Mr. Li and the others.

55
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,990
Talk it through and clear the air.

56
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,238
Mr. Li, don't get worked up.

57
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,270
Let's go sit down in my office.

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,919
Come on, Li.

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,510
Now that's more like it.

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,960
Calm down. Don't forget I'm still around.

61
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,440
- I'm doing this out of respect for you.
- Get back to work.

62
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,109
You okay?

63
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,829
That little drama today
was clearly Qian Lei's doing.

64
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,798
He also rallied
a few close shareholders.

65
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,350
I'm sure more is coming.

66
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,829
You need to be careful.

67
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,078
No matter what tricks he pulls,

68
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,949
I'll focus on doing my job right.

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,439
Ning, you don't have to rush it.

70
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,709
Take it slow.

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,829
What a shame.

72
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,750
Dad.

73
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,119
I really thought

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,310
Ning would end up as my daughter-in-law.

75
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,478
Then, your stepfather and I

76
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,310
could've helped you run the company.

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,070
You're still too young.

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,149
Now you've made quite the laughingstock.

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,638
Thanks for your concern, Mr. Yan.

80
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,590
I've got my own way of doing things.

81
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,910
Mr. Yan.

82
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,070
Mr. Qian.

83
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,109
She's become
too sensitive to criticism.

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,918
She is young, after all.

85
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,239
She is eager to prove herself.

86
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,470
She won't relent without some obstacles.

87
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,630
All we can do

88
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,829
is think ahead about how to clean it up.

89
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,510
Ning, don't pay them any mind.

90
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,630
If you need help, just tell me.

91
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,149
No. I don't want you
getting dragged into this.

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,790
Go keep Mr. Yan company.

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,549
All right.

96
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,638
Qian Lei would never let

97
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,790
the Guilinggao line get axed.

98
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,798
That's his cash cow.

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,350
Can't believe how much he skimmed.

100
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,350
He's got a serious appetite.

101
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,949
As long as Ning
and Qian Lei keep fighting,

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,230
the waters at Yi Yuan
will only get murkier.

103
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,549
That's when our chance comes.

104
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,829
How are you holding up at the Yi house?

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,119
Make sure you stay safe.

106
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,750
Plans can fail,

107
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,190
but you mustn't get hurt.

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,389
Ning, you're drunk.

109
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,269

Don't worry.

111
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,830
I'll take care of myself.

112
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,590

Didn't you promise me
you'd stop drinking?

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,989
I just had a little.

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,230
In a bad mood?

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,119
Drinking alone

121
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,069
makes you feel worse.

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,669
Let me make you some nice food.

123
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,999
The stomach reflects how we feel.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,030
It reflects our emotions.

125
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,069
Only when your stomach's okay

126
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,869
can your mind handle
everything else better.

127
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,069
You're the one who told me that.

128

I'll show you how the steps.

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,629
First, mash the pumpkin into purée.

135
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,030
Give it a try.

136
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,590
Here.

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,109
Pumpkin is rich in vitamin B6.

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,629
It helps regulate
neurotransmitters in your brain.

139
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,439
And when vitamin B6

140
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,749
builds up in your body
to a certain level,

141
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,390
it even acts
as a natural antidepressant.

142
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,429
So when you eat this,

143
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,669
your mood will get better.

144
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,749

You don't need to thank me.

It's not like I can help much
with your work.

152

No.

155
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,710
Well, I had a whole group
yell at me today.

156
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,958
They were all longtime employees
from when Yi Yuan first started.

157
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,749
They said I've forgotten my roots.

158
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,710
That I'd ruin Yi Yuan in my hands.

159
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,869
Did I really mess up?

160
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,150
Don't listen to them.

161
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,830
I know full well

162
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,669
how much you care about Yi Yuan.

163
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,549
There's no way you'd destroy it.

164
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,230
But even Ri'an said I'm too aggressive.

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,350
Yan Ri'an?

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,950
What does he know?
Just treat what he said like hot air.

167
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,869
Besides,

168
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,919
if you just do
what they say like they do,

169
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,509
can you really protect Yi Yuan?

170
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,509
Would you even be happy?

171
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,390
Exactly. So don't listen to them.

172
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,309

179
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,749
I've started developing new products.

180

00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,119
The vendors we've worked with

184
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,518
for shady transactions
already warned us.

185
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,710
They made threats.

186
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,719
If they don't get their cut,

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,678
they'll burn it all down
and expose everything.

188
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,950
Yi Ning sure is relentless.

189
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,109
She won't show me any respect
unless I teach her a lesson.

190
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,749
Go round up a few guys.

191
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,590
We do it tonight.

192
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,310
Ning!

193
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,869
Ning!

194
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,479
Are you okay, Ning?

195
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm alright.

196
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,590
Ning!

197
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,830
Ning!

198
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,430
Ning!

199
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:15,758
Ning!

200
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,678
What are you doing?

201
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,518
Freeze! Don't move!

202
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,430
Don't move!

203
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,079
We've got a situation in B2!

204
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,869
Someone get down here! B2, now!

205
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,869
Ning!

206
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,959
It's just some bruising.

207
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,550
Nothing serious.

208
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,109
Ning.

209
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,629
Why did you take the hit for me?

210
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,509
Why are you asking that?

211
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,029
You're my husband.

212
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,830
Protecting you is the least I can do.

213
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,749
And I said it back when I proposed.

214
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,430
I'd always protect you.

215
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,389
Marry me?

216
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,590
As long as you're with me,

217
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,109
I promise I won't let anything hurt you.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,359
But this is just a contract marriage.

219
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,950
But I've never wanted just a contract.

220
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,989
I want a real husband.

221
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,550
I'll always protect you too.

222
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,950
By the way,
what did those two thugs say?

223
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,830
They claimed it was
a lust-driven attack.

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,438
But to me,
they looked like they came prepared.

225
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,398
It didn't look random.

226
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,149
It's obviously Mr. Qian's doing.

227
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,438
I didn't think

228
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:39,670
he'd stoop to something this low.

229
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,310
That's because you're too kind.

230
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,190
You think the world is
as kind as you are.

231
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,918
But the world's full of evil people

232
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,070
who will take you down
by any means necessary.

233
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,550
You have to stay alert.

234
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,989
Alright, I got it.

235
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,670
I have you now, don't I?

236
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,749
My right-hand man.

237
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,070
(I will see this plan through.)

238
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,109
(I'll keep you safe.)

239
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,950
(I just hope you won't hate me
when the time comes.)

240
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,199
You can't move this right now.

241
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,629
It'll only make it worse.

242
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,678
But it's itchy and I can't reach it!

243
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,909
You'll have to bear with it.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,359
How about we do something else

245
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,710
to distract you?

246
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,350
Ning.

247
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,909
Look what I brought you.

248
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,758
That Guilinggao line raises
too many questions.

249
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,959
Mr. Qian definitely messed
with the numbers.

250
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,839
I actually found out

251
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,430
by accident on my dad's computer.

252
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,199
But, I can't look into it anymore.

253
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,869
- You know how my dad is.
- I know.

254
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,989
Your family's ties
to Mr. Qian run too deep.

255
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,070
Just giving me this already means a lot.

256
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,719
No wonder Qian Lei

257
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,350
kept stopping me
from cutting the Guilinggao line.

258
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,950
He's been siphoning money from it.

259
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,550
I'll check the old project files.

260
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,870
(Guilinggao production facilities)

261
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,599
Can't you let her rest on
this pleasant weekend?

262
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,599
She's still a patient.

263
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,398
Ning loves working more than anything.

264
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,479
Keeping her in bed all day
would only make it worse.

265
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,438
We enjoyed our leisure

266
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,959
until you showed up.

267
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,269
You're a nutjob.

268
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:42,518
What's your problem?

269
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,430
What now?

270
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,038
- You want a fight?
- What now?

271
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,070
What do you want?

272
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,190
How about this?

273
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,670
Don't mess with me.

274
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,230
You...

275
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,518
You two are getting along.

276
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,599
We're not!

277
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,509
Not a chance!

278
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,869
You're getting on my nerves!

279
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,950
You two carry on, I'll leave you be.

280
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,638
Ri'an.

281
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,749
Come to my study later.

282
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,869
Nutjob.

283
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,758
Yi Ning, get out of Yi Yuan!

284
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:01,470
No forced layoffs!

285
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,638
Yi Ning, get out of Yiyuan!

286
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,398
No forced layoffs!

287
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,558
What's going on?

288
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,749
Layoffs?

289
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,798
I never said anything about layoffs.

290
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,310
Yi Ning, come out!

291
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,690
(Next Episode)

292
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,950
I...

293
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,190
Are you hurt, Wenwen?

294

(A Little Restaurant)

295
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,310
Don't tell me you actually fell for her

296
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,190
