14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,080
Ning! What are you doing here?

15
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:52,080
Shen Qianze.
You were helping Qian Lei to spy on me?

16
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:53,951
No! He threatened me.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,199
But I didn't do anything to hurt you.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,479
So you've been keeping track
of when I eat and sleep every day

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,351
just to report back to Qian Lei?

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,960
And what if that's not enough for him?

21
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,320
What if he asks you to steal
business secrets for him?

22
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:07,240
I would never

23
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,990
do anything to hurt you.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,559
I just thought
he's technically my father-in-law...

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,951
This family's name is Yi!

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,391
Shen Qianze, you don't have
to let a Qian boss you around.

27
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:18,391
It's not embarrassing
to rely on your wife

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,910
at a time like this.

29
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,491
(A Little Restaurant)

30
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,391
Boss, your guest is here.

31
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:37,671
This way.

32
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,151
Uncle.

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,350
You're here.

34
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:47,830
Have a seat.

35
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,151
Try it.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
Are you adjusting well
to life in the Yi family?

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,671
Yi Ning is onto me.

38
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:19,000
Ze, if it's too risky, just come back.

39
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,030
Don't take the risk.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,120
Even if you don't stay in the Yi family,
I'll figure out another way to help you.

41
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,030
No.

42
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,471
I will see this through.

43
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:40,399
Today's a family banquet.
Everyone, enjoy yourselves.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,471
Come on. Let's have a drink first.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,351
Mr. Qian, you're too kind.

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,160
Mr. Wen, go get Shen Qianze.

47
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,030
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,959
My son-in-law

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,440
is an impressive chef.

50
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,040
He's served a lot of guests.

51
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,519
Order whatever you want today.

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
He can make anything.

53
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,270
All right.

54
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:00,359
Here, here.

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,030
Dad, I need to talk to Ning about something.
I'll be right back.

56
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:05,720
It's rude to leave
before the meal even begins.

57
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,590
Whatever it is,
talk about it after dinner.

58
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,550
Mr. Qian.

59
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:12,911
Mr. Shen is here.

60
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,471
This is my son-in-law, Shen Qianze.

61
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,000
He's served a lot of guests.

62
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,160
He's an experienced chef.

63
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,391
Order whatever you want.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,471
A chef?

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,080
Let's see what kind of dishes
you can make for us.

66
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,239
Come on.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,310
Name a few.

68
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,720
I'm Yi Ning's husband,

69
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,040
not the Yi family's chef.

70
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,079
Mr. Qian, don't you think
this is a bit inappropriate?

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
It's just hosting some guests.

72
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:36,951
Why are you getting so worked up?

73
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,160
Or are you not even really a chef?

74
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,799
I am a chef,

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,079
but in the Yi family,
I'm Yi Ning's husband.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,199
I have to consider my wife's feelings.

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,120
If you have nothing to hide,

78
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:48,959
why are you so sensitive
about what people say?

79
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,840
I think

80
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,111
you're just jealous
because you can't have what you want.

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,880
Enough!
A mere chef marries into the Yi family

82
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,079
and suddenly thinks

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,479
he's a prince now?

84
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,959
How dare you talk back to guests!

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,111
That's right!

86
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,399
Mr. Qian,

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,479
Ning has poor taste in men.

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,120
A chef is basically a servant.

89
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,990
How is he worthy of the Yi family?

90
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,590
Shen, did you hear that?

91
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,671
Remember your place.

92
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,861
Stop scheming.

93
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,360
Behave yourself here,

94
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:20,480
and maybe I'll let you
keep living comfortably.

95
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:21,680
Or else...

96
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:23,031
Or else what?

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,671
Ms. Ning.

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,719
Are you all out of food or something?

99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,800
You traveled all this way
to beg for a meal at my house?

100
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,159
Watch your tone, Yi Ning!

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,519
They're your elders!

102
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,510
I don't have such petty elders.

103
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:40,320
It doesn't matter
whether Shen Qianze used to be

104
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,630
a chef or a beggar.

105
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,039
He's my family now.

106
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,271
And I won't let anyone bully him.

107
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,911
Qian Lei.

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,560
This family's name is Yi, not Qian.

109
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,360
I respected all of you here as elders.

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
But if you keep pushing it,

111
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,640
- don't blame me for being rude!
- Yi Ning!

112
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,199
Mr. Wen!

113
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,920
Yes, Ms. Ning.

114
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,199
- See the guests out.
- Very well.

115
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,120
I'll see who dares!

116
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:00,680
I...

117
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:01,550
Leave!

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,760
Never mind.

119
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,280
- She's out of line!
- Stay seated, everyone.

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,990
Calm down, everyone.

121
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,510
I am the man of this house.

122
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,031
She's completely out of line!

123
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,430
Ning!

124
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,550
Ning!

125
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,430
I need to talk to you.

126
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:20,151
You go on ahead.

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,199
Yan Ri'an, I'm so disappointed in you.

128
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,719
You actually went along with them.

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,639
It's not like that.

130
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,560
I've never cared
about Shen Qianze's background.

131
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:35,430
I only care about why
he got close to you.

132
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,950
Look at this, Ning.

133
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,639
Shen Qianze isn't innocent.

134
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,870
His relationship with Su Jingxuan
from Shang Su Group is anything but ordinary.

135
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,599
Mr. Yan, you were right.

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,550
Shen Qianze isn't what he appears to be.

137
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,920
Shen Qianze.

138
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,390
What's your relationship
with Su Jingxuan from Shang Su Group?

139
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,990
Ning, I told you
something was up with him!

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,800
How is a chef running a small restaurant

141
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,671
so close to Su Jingxuan?

142
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,560
Shen Qianze, I want an explanation.

143
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,510
Ning.

144
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,199
I was worried that if I told you,

145
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,880
it would change how you see me.

146
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,399
That's why I never mentioned it.

147
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,151
Su Jingxuan is actually my sponsor.

148
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,310
Keep making things up! Go on!

149
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,320
(Sponsorship Expense List)
I'm an orphan.

150
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,471
Su Jingxuan is a benefactor
of our orphanage.

151
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,279
It's thanks to his help that I was able
to open A Little Restaurant

152
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,911
and realize my dream.

153
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,831
(Sponsorship Expense List)
He's like an older brother to me.

154
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:54,000
Why didn't you

155
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,680
tell me this sooner?

156
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,911
Ning!

157
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:59,000
You've been helping me all this time.

158
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,399
I already feel guilty enough.

159
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,639
If you knew that I'm someone
who needed others' pity

160
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,671
and help just to survive,

161
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,390
I was afraid
you wouldn't want me anymore.

162
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,310
I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.

163
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,750
It's okay.

164
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,310
It's my fault you got caught.

165
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:49,639
It's a good thing you were prepared.

166
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,950
It's all right, Uncle.

167
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,471
They were bound to find out
sooner or later.

168
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,031
Now that it's out in the open,
it's actually better for us.

169
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:57,911
I'm still worried.

170
00:07:58,313 --> 00:07:59,741
With that Yan Ri'an around,

171
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,929
it'll be hard for you
to make your next move.

172
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,039
I think Yan Ri'an's little stunt

173
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,800
actually gave me a chance
to turn the tables.

174
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,711
It'll make Yi Ning trust me even more.

175
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:10,870
Can you pull it off?

176
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,749
Yan Ri'an

177
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,111
is Yi Ning's childhood friend.

178
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,519
Then let her see with her own eyes

179
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,750
that her so-called childhood friend
has ulterior motives.

180
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:29,911
I didn't expect
to serve you again, Mr. Yan.

181
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,831
What would you like to eat?

182
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,390
Just bring out
a few of your specialties.

183
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,551
All right.

184
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,790
Where are you going, Mr. Yan?

185
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,231
The washroom.

186
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,670
The washroom's that way.

187
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,120
I'll have someone lead you there.

188
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,191
Never mind. I don't need to go anymore.

189
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,960
This is our signature dish,

190
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:12,240
"Spicy Red River."

191
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,831
I hope it's to your liking.

192
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:20,399
Mr. Yan, don't tell me
you can't handle a little spice.

193
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,831
He and Ning wouldn't make a good match.

194
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,679
Aren't you childhood friends?

195
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,559
And you can't even share
a common taste in food?

196
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,439
Who says I can't handle spice?

197
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,480
Mr. Yan, please enjoy your meal.

198
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:35,630
I'll make two more
of my specialties for you.

199
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,711
All right.

200
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,760
Mr. Yan.

201
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:41,870
Allow me to serve you.

202
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,351
Here.

203
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,750
You...

204
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:45,630
Please.

205
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:50,630
How is it?

206
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,351
I need a moment.

207
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,231
You're giving me hot water
after such a spicy dish?

208
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,670
It's just my way of showing care.

209
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:03,360
I know you might feel uncomfortable
after eating spicy food,

210
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,231
so I prepared some hot water
to warm your stomach.

211
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,990
Don't you feel better?

212
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,711
Try these two dishes I made for you.

213
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,591
I made them extra spicy.

214
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,551
- Enjoy.
- Eat up.

215
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:18,919
Allow me.

216
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,030
I'll serve you.

217
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,120
I'll serve you.

218
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,799
No need.

219
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,030
I can do it myself.

220
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,591
Is it not good?

221
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,711
How's the taste, Mr. Yan?

222
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:41,790
You win this time.

223
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,030
You haven't told us
if you like the food yet.

224
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,270
Quite the wine collection he has here.

225
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,951
That Shen Qianze!

226
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:49,311
He actually had a secret room.

227
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,510
I would've called the police
if it weren't for Ning.

228
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,071
I couldn't tell at all.

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,679
The Shen Qianze who's all meek
and obedient in front of Ning

230
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,591
actually has another side to him.

231
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,720
Quite the act you've been putting on.

232
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:19,630
That's for Ning to decide, not you.

233
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,591
Did I hit a nerve?

234
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,270
Why are you so nervous?

235
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,591
Unless you're really

236
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,831
hiding something in this room?

237
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,039
If it weren't for Ning,

238
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,711
I would have dealt with you already!

239
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,910
What's going on here?

240
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,639
- Ning! Shen Qianze is hiding something!
- Get up.

241
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,630
Look!

242
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:42,870
Look at the wall!

243
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:45,390
Are you all right?

244
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:48,000
Mr. Yan.

245
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,279
You're always welcome
to eat at my restaurant.

246
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,520
Every time you come here,
you're always snooping around.

247
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,760
But have you ever found anything?

248
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,919
I treat you as Ning's friend

249
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,639
and welcome you warmly.

250
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,270
But you're investigating me?

251
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:01,480
What have I done

252
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,159
to deserve this suspicion?

253
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,231
"Welcome warmly"?

254
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:08,639
Ning, don't let him fool you!
He wasn't acting like this just now!

255
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,551
Ning.

256
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,800
I can't to live
under constant surveillance.

257
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
If you all suspect me this much,
maybe we should just get a divorce!

258
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
No matter what others think, I trust you.

259
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:18,880
Ning!

260
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,870
Ri'an!

261
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,750
I know you care about me. But there are
some things you don't know.

262
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,030
Come on.

263
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:28,311
Come on!

264
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,071
Here.

(Marriage Contract)

266
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:41,670
I'm in a contract marriage
with Shen Qianze.

267
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,951
I needed his help

268
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,630
to take over Yi Yuan.

269
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:46,910
Ning.

270
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,159
If you needed a marriage partner,

271
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,360
why didn't you come to me?

272
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:51,799
How could you have helped me

273
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,351
with your family's ties to Qian Lei?

274
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,200
Besides, if you were to get involved,

275
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,159
I'd rather you be my backup support

276
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,150
when things get tough.

277
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,919
You really trust that Shen Qianze?

278
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,919
I handpicked him.

279
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,510
We signed a contract.

280
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:07,799
Don't worry.

281
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,111
I can protect my own assets.

282
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,120
(Ning, it's not your assets
I'm worried about.)

283
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:24,790
(It's your heart.)

284
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,191
Give that to me.

285
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,630
I'll get your glasses fixed.

286
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,639
Don't be upset anymore, please?

287
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,711
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,880
I put all your favorite recipes
on the wall...

289
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,711
I know, I know...

290
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,270
Does it hurt?

291
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,799
It hurts.

292
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,799
Where does it hurt?

293
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,990
Everywhere.

294
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:01,030
