No.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,399
Mr. Qian, Mr. Yi wants to see you.

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,470
Coming.

Scammer! I'm not transferring any money.

25
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,240
You don't need to transfer anything.

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,271
You just need
to collect the prize in person.

27
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:55,920
I only have to show up to get it?

28
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,871
That's right!
It's a five million yuan jackpot!

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,520
But you need to claim it in person

30
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,199
and there's a time limit.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,319
It ends today.

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,199
All right. Wait for me.

And yet you're the one suffering for it.

37

Where is she?

38
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:34,430

some soul-searching right now.

Boss, take a look.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,280
Qian Lei and Jiang Xinlian
are from the same village.

47
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,270
They're basically childhood sweethearts.

48
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:02,880
Qian Lei hasn't even tried to hide it.

49
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,231
Especially after Yi An...

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,599
After that woman passed away,

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,110
he's been flaunting it.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,031
Through her, Qian Lei has already transferred
a lot of Yi Yuan's assets.

53
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,639
At this rate, it won't be long

54

fully takes over the Yi family house.

- I haven't taken my shoes off yet.
- It's all right. No one's home.

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,150
I've missed you so much...

60
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,000
Ning?

61
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:47,919

Grandpa's not doing well!

00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,631
He's been stabilized.

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,919
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,680
To see Grandpa.

68
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,240
He needs rest.

69
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,919
He can't take any visitors.

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,479
You do nothing at home all day.

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,311
How can you not even
take care of an elderly man?

72
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,759
Well, I'm not like you. I don't have
someone's wife to take care of.

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,550
You...

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,630
It's my fault.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,471
I failed to look after Grandpa.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,630
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,959
It's not your fault.
You're already doing your best.

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,951
Ri'an, don't blame him.

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,000
But it's strange.

80
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,719
Grandpa was perfectly fine.

81
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,591
Why did he suddenly collapse?

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,831
I have no idea.

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,310
But Father...

84
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,591
I mean, Qian Lei.

85
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,199
He said a few things to Grandpa

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,391
and he just...

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,351
Ning!

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,920
How can Ning not see through

89
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:54,471
such an obvious act?

90
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:02,839
How much longer

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,310
are you going to keep me waiting?

92
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,279
You're not still afraid of Yi An, are you?

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,519
That woman's already dead.
Why bring her up?

94
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,791
She's bad luck.

95
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,079
What are you doing?

96
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,190
What's wrong with you?

97
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,591
Adulterous scoundrels!

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
How could you do this to my mother?

99
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,440
Who are you calling adulterers?

100
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,719
Your mom's been dead for years!

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,620
It's perfectly reasonable
for me to find someone new!

102
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,040
Reasonable?

103
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,151
Aren't you afraid of karma
for doing this?

104
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,391
You...

105
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,519
You even did this in front of my mother!

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,310
You disgust me!

107
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,159
Let's see how you'll deal with me!

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,079
As long as I'm alive,

109
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,031
this family will never carry
the Qian name!

Ning.

112
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,550
Come on.

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,711
Ning.

114
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,831
I'll stay by your side
and help you protect everything that's yours.

115
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:34,279
Thank you.
I'd like to be alone for a while.

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,951
All right. Call me if you need anything.

117
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:16,231
Don't worry, Mom.

118
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,471
I will protect the Yi family.

119
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,959
Thanks for the Spring Water Stir-Fry.

120
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,630
How much have you had to drink?

121
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,711
Come on, I'll take you to clean up.

122
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,670
You made me walk in on them

123
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:19,031
on purpose, didn't you?

124
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,640
I've known about them for a while now.
I just didn't know how to tell you.

125
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:26,951
Don't worry.

126
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:29,791
I'll drive them out.

127
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,711
No one will bully you again.

128
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:34,831
I'm just worried about you.

129
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,071
Worried about me?

130
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,750
Worried that Qian Lei
will steal my inheritance

131
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,910
and kick me out of the house?

132
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:53,191
Worried they'll hurt me

133
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,390
and leave me with nothing?

134
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,510
Will you help me, then?

135
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,591
I will.

136
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,351
Ning, you had too much to drink.

137
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,799
You're my husband.

138
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,671
What's wrong with giving me a kiss?

139
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,750
I'll kiss you all I want.

140
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,910
Ning, you're drunk...

141
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,951
Ning!

142
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:27,630
You said it yourself.

143
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,351
I'm your husband.

144
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,471
Don't regret this.

145
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,471
I haven't showered yet!

146
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,870
Can't get in bed without showering.

147
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,311
Alcohol really messes with your head.

148
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,750
Awake?

149
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,110
Ning, you had too much to drink.

150
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,720
You're my husband.

151
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,439
What's wrong with giving me a kiss?

152
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,990
I'll kiss you all I want.

153
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,861
Ning, you're drunk...

154
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:51,120
You don't remember last night?

155
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,270
I don't remember.

156
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,591
I made some soup to cure your hangover.
Get up and have some.

157
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,919
About what you promised me last night.

158
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,191
You have to help me now.

159
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,630
I'll always be by your side.

160
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:11,870
Good boy.

161
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:15,231
You have to promise me something too.

162
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,759
You're not allowed
to drink so much anymore.

163
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,739
You go around kissing people when
you're drunk. What if I'm not there next time?

164
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:21,759
I don't just kiss anyone.

165
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,110
So you've kissed other people?

166
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,960
No one else, I think?

167
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:28,351
You think?

168
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:37,750
- I haven't brushed my teeth.
- I don't mind.

169
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:39,790
I mind.

170
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:45,600
Grandpa,

171
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:48,120
Qianze made
this medicinal rice porridge for you.

172
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,720
It's good for replenishing
blood and energy.

173
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,711
Shen is thoughtful.

174
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,630
Did you have a complete fall out
with Qian Lei?

175
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:11,390
Grandpa, you have no idea
how awful he's been.

176
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,471
You're too impulsive.

177
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:20,910
Grandpa, you knew
about everything he's done?

178
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,039
And you still...

179
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,519
Yi Yuan still needs him for now.

180
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,071
But I'm back now.

181
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,799
I'll drive his people out

182
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,039
and take back control of Yi Yuan.

183
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,910
Ning, you've only just stepped in.

184
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,919
Don't act rashly.

185
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,159
Making big moves now
will only give him leverage against you.

186
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,600
But I can't just keep backing down.

187
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,071
Grandpa, don't worry.

188
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,671
I will protect everything
you and Mom built.

189
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,910
I believe you.

190
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:03,159
She wants to shut down
the entire Guilinggao product line?

191
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,270
Yes.

192
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,240
Guilinggao is our

193
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,120
most profitable product!

194
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,799
If she shuts down the whole line,

195
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,671
how are we supposed to make money?

196
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:13,790
She's openly declaring war on me.

197
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:16,136
You better figure out a way to stop her.

198
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,870
She's not just cutting into my profits.

199
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,351
There are others
who'll be even more desperate.

200
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,191
Go spread the word to Li and the others.

201
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,311
Li?

202
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,910
That group of stubborn old employees?

203
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
They've been working

204
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,120
on the Guilinggao product line
since the factory was founded.

205
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,120
If they find out

206
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:41,439
that this clueless Ms. Yi wants
to scrap the line

207
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
as soon as she takes over,

208
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,990
they'll cause a huge uproar.

209
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,120
Yi Ning must give us an explanation!

210
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:48,600
- We won't accept otherwise!
- Guys!

211
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,519
We can talk about this!

212
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,159
Ms. Yi is busy.

213
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,200
We can take this to the conference room.

214
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:52,790
That's right!

215
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,003
- Tell her to come out!
-  Come out!

216
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:54,890
Ms. Yi is busy.

217
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:56,320
- Come out!
- Get out here!

218
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,311
- Come out!
- Get out here right now!

219
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:00,480
- Let us through!
- Everyone, calm down.

220
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:03,919
- We're not leaving until we get answers!
- That's right!

221
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,110
Shutting down the Guilinggao line
is for the company's long-term development.

222
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:09,071
Everyone will be properly reassigned.

223
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:10,750
For the good of Yi Yuan?

224
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:13,360
Guilinggao is the very foundation
of Yi Yuan!

225
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,799
You think you can just
shut it down like that? This is betrayal!

226
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,439
That's right!

227
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,639
If this continues,

228
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,431
Yi Yuan will fall under your leadership!

229
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:25,131
