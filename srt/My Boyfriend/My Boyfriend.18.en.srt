Mr. Su is here

18
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,800
to discuss our
new project collaboration.

00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:55,751

to tattle on you?

What does that mean?

It's nothing. I suppose you two
are done with your chat, right?

I'll send him back first.

Ms. Yi.

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,400
I'll tell you about it
in secret next time.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,839
Uncle, what exactly are you up to?

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,880
I just want to tell you

30
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:25,711
that there's no turning back for you.

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,071
Ze, you better stop being willful.

32
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,550

Something's off about you.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,750
I'm fine.

36
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:02,239
Maybe I was startled
by the previous incident.

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,271
I felt nervous as
I didn't get to see you.

38
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,271
Don't worry. I'm here.

39
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,911

41
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,191
Of course.

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,870
What if you found out
that I deceived you one day?

43
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,550
Will you still stay by my side?

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,031
It depends.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,270
It depends on whether you were trying
to cheat me of my feelings or money.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,911
What's the difference?

47
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,639
Deceiving my feelings is fine.

48
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,710
But if you try to cheat me of my money,
I'll sever my ties with you.

49

50

Don't tell me you were
deceiving my feelings?

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,310
what is this?

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,911
This is the recipe

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,519
of a snack that was once sold

70
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,110
by Yi Yuan Group.

71
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:37,391
But for some reason,
the production stopped.

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,630
Keep it in the file for that year.

73
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,480
You have to blame Yi An for this.

74
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,550
She desired the recipe of Bazhen Cake.

75
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,711
But your mother
wasn't willing to give it to her.

76
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,079
That's why she designed this incident

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,591
to smear the reputation of Bazhen Cake.

78
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:52,990
That caused your mother to...

79
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:54,440
(So, Yi An)

80
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:57,271

So what?

Is avenging your mother
less important than protecting Yi Ning?

Did you forget

in the first place?

135
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,360

repay the suffering your mother endured!

Ze, I just did
what you didn't dare to do.

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,110
She's just a woman.

142
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,790

she won't be able to escape.

What's going on?

180
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,399
This is the equity transfer agreement

181
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,919
signed by the other shareholders
of Yi Yuan, excluding you.

182
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,071
Now, I'm the largest shareholder
of Yi Yuan Group.

183
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:19,711
I'm sorry,
but Yi Yuan Group is mine now.

184
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,510
So, you approached me from the start

185
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,110
in order to get your hands
on Yi Yuan Group, huh?

186
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,110
Who exactly are you?

187
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,750
I forgot to tell you this.

188
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,270
My mother's surname is Su.

189
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,510
Su?

190
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,910
How are you related to Shang Su Group?

191
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,240
Who are you to Su Jingxuan?

192
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,671
Ning, I didn't lie to you
regarding that.

193
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,110
Su Jingxuan is my sponsor.

194
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,471
But he's my uncle as well.

195
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,231
Su Jingxuan is his uncle?

196
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,270
So, you're here to purchase
Yi Yuan Group

197
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,591
as the representative
of Shang Su Group, huh?

198
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:13,671
Sorry. I have my own
bitter reasons for doing so.

199
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,551
Let's get a divorce.

200
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,840
- Ning!
- Let go! Don't touch her!

201
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,870
- Ning!
- Don't touch her!

202
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:22,439
Ri'an!

203
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,039
Mr. Yan!

204
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,510
You can hate me,
but you cannot leave me.

205
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,030
I'll leave the rest to you all.

206
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,671
Let go of me!

207
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,711
Let go of me!

208
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:36,431
Shen Qianze, let go of me!

209
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,870
Put me down!

210
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,831
Shen Qianze, put me down!

211
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,790
Let me go!

212
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,711
You scum! You liar!

213
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,510
I must be blind
to marry you in the first place!

214
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,951
You're a total jinx!

215
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,080
Put me down!

216
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:56,471
Let me go!

217
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,390
Shen Qianze, have you lost your mind?

218
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
How could you do this to me?

219
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,200
Yi Ning, listen up.

220
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,480
I said you cannot leave me.

221
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,351
That's not a request. That's an order.

222
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:12,679
Why are you doing this?

223
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,150
I knew that you would leave me
ever since I've decided

224
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,990
to take revenge on Yi Yuan Group.

225
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,000
But now, it's already too late for me
to stop. I'll never let you leave me!

226
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,399
Why did you do this?

227
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,831
It's because my mother died
because of your mother!

228
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,471
My mother died because of your mother.

229
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,711
Shen Qianze,

230
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,831
I think my mother

231
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,910
is not the person you described.

232
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,960
Is there a misunderstanding between us?

233
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,870
I have concrete evidence.
There's no point in arguing.

234
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,231
You didn't eat for the entire day.

235
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:56,870
Have some soup.

236
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,990
No matter why you did so,

237
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,831
you've already achieved your goal.

238
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:11,910
Ning.

239
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:15,431
I admit, I approached you
for an ulterior motive.

240
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,071
But I truly love you as well.

241
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,679
I cannot let go of my mother's death.

242
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,390
I cannot let go of you either.

243
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,231
I don't expect you to forgive me.

244
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,439
But I won't allow you to leave me.

245
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,351
Shen Qianze, who do you take me for?

246
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,431
A clown that you can toy with
whenever you want?

247
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,071
Why are you still pretending?

248
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:43,471
Have some soup.

249
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,399
Listen up. I'll never eat
any of your cooking again

250
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,279
even if it means I have to eat trash!

251
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
You disgust me!

252
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,831
What if I'm forcing you to eat?

253
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,231
How did our relationship
end up like this?

254
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,390
You brought it upon yourself.

255
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:55,491
(Next Episode)

256
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,431
Why are we tormenting
each other like this?

257
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,270
Why would I torment you?

258
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,431
I love you.

259
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,431
I love you so much.

260
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,270
Shen Qianze,
why aren't you willing to let me off?

261
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,711
Do it.

262
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,270
I won't let you leave my side.
