I've never mentioned that.

- It must be Qian Lei again.
- Ning.

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,378
You should stay away
from the office today.

20
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,179
No way. Avoiding from the problem
isn't going to solve it.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,609
But this is too dangerous.

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,689
I'll come with you.

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,418
What's good about Guilinggao?

24
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:15,489
We're not buying it.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,978
Let's get this instead.

26
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:18,930
Sure.

27
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,049

33
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,650
Please have this dessert
before the meal, Ms. Yi.

34
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,498
I've never liked

35
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,019
our Guilinggao.

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,289
It's too bitter.

37
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,699
But it cools you down.

38
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,169
Also, it doesn't contain additives.

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,689
Yet, people aren't buying it
because it doesn't taste good.

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,610
No one cares about how good it is.

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,179
It will be taken off the shelf
eventually.

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,849
Actually, there are those who need it.

43
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:33,490
Look.

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,250
No one was buying our Guilinggao
at the supermarket.

45
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,569
I never thought
it'd be well received here.

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,009
They are different consumer groups.

47
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,899
Customers at the supermarket

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,620
not only care
about its cooling function,

49
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,289
but they also want it to have
an innovative flavor and packaging.

50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,058
So, instead of getting rid of it,
I should market it in two different forms.

51
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,129
That's right. You're smart, Ms. Yi.

52
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,778
If so, I should introduce

53
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,739
an affordable, classic version

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,818
and an exclusive one
with an innovative design.

55
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,090
How brilliant of you.

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,430
(Guilinggao)

57
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:37,378
Eat first. You can continue later.

58
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,330
No, I can wait no more.

59
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,218
I need to finalize the new product line

60
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,449
soonest possible.

61
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:44,530
How about this?

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,849
Tell me your ideas. I'll do the typing.

63
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,129
Shall we eat first?

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,849
Sure.

65
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,889
Thank you for today.

66
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,770
You showed me what I never came across.

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,810
Like I said,

68
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,810
I will be your left-hand man.

69
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,050
But I want you to be my...

70
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:21,250
Your hubby.

71
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,538
Well, I only shell prawns

72
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,689
for you alone.

73
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,259
What's going on?

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,819
I have no idea.

75
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,889
Let's go check it out.

76
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,850
You've approached Li
and the others, haven't you?

77
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,098
Of course.

78
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,699
We must fight Yi Ning until the end

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,290
and force her leave Yi Yuan.

80
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,098
I've told Secretary Liu to arrange

81
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,858
the execution of the new product line.

82
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,290
So you may stay.

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,209
We're sorry, Ms. Yi.

84
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,129
We were fooled

85
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,410
into believing that you were here
to wreak havoc.

86
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:41,338
Surprisingly, not only did you
not make us pay for causing a scene,

87
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,490
but you've also considered
our benefits.

88
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,810
You were right.

89
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:48,610
I shouldn't have focused
on temporarily benefits

90
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,490
by compromising
our camaraderie and goal.

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,290
You are certainly a loyal person.

92
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,139
As expected of the successor

93
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,059
chosen by Yi.

94
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,250
- Yes.
- Indeed.

95
00:05:58,419 --> 00:05:59,490
Mr. Li.

96
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,298
Regarding the planning of our product,

97
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,218
let's about it.

98
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:04,009
Sure.

99
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,259
What is this?

100
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,978
This way, please.

101
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,250
I don't know either.

102
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,009
It was her, Ms. Yi.

103
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,649
She was fanning the flames
in an attempt to drive you out of Yi Yuan.

104
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,520
Stop talking nonsense, I didn't do that!

105
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,978
- It was you!
- You said that!

106
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:19,418
It was you!

107
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,290
Mr. Qian...

108
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,139
Jiang Wenwen.

109
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,338
Just speak your mind.

110
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,459
You don't have to pull such petty,
dirty tricks behind my back.

111
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,019
It... It's all a misunderstanding.

112
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,290
I thought Mr. Li and the others
would be dismissed.

113
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:34,778
Did I mention about a layoff?

114
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,858
- No... No.
- Not at all.

115
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:37,970
You never said so.

116
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,050
I...

117
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,738
Jiang Wenwen, head home for a rest
if you're not feeling well.

118
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,930
You are no longer needed here.

119
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,689
I'm all right.

120
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,050
I just felt dizzy.

121
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,410
I'm going back to work.

122
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,290
Don't just stand there, get to work.

123
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,490
Get back to work.

124
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,649
- Let's go.
- Quick, let's go.

125
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,338
Mr. Li.

126
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,379
I'm counting on you all.

127
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:05,978
No problem.

128
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,569
Rest assured, Ms. Yi.

129
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,170
Boss.

130
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,298
Why are we using
this ready-made Guilinggao

131
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:26,250
as dessert now?

132
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,209
I remember you ever said

133
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,418
we only used fresh ingredients,

134
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,819
not these

135
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,778
cultivated raw materials.

136
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,978
This Yi Yuan Guilinggao

137
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,418
doesn't contain additives.

138
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,610
It's good enough.

139
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,619
Are you talking about the Guilinggao

140
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,569
or its owner?

141
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,778
If you're too free,

142
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,810
go clean the cups again.

143
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,610
Look at you.

144
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,259
You are glowing.

145
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,658
Don't tell me you're being serious?

146
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,460
Have you fallen in love
with Yi Ning for real?

147
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:04,490
Boss, just a heads up.

148
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:07,370
It's not going to work for you two.

149
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,410
I know.

150
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,379
Ri'an. Try this.
I've got it especially for you.

151
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,290
It's your favorite
Pre-Qingming Longjing tea.

152
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,379
How kind of you.

153
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,050
Just say it. How can I help?

154
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:28,059
Well,

155
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,490
I'm planning to introduce
a brand new high-end gift box

156
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,778
with our existing Guilinggao model.

157
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,649
I'm talking
about a premium Chinese style branding.

158
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,019
Yet, regarding its design,

159
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,610
I need your help as you're a master
of traditional Chinese painting.

160
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,889
Sure.

161
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,970
But I have a request.

162
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:48,938
Well,

163
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,769
I can give you whatever you want.

164
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,490
Let me have half of your office.

165
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,370
That way, if we ever run into an issue,
we can communicate with one another directly.

166
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,169
That's it?

167
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:01,219
Yes.

168
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,330
It's no big deal.

169
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,330
Great!

you're jealous.
