What's wrong? Is it not nice?

18

That's not it.
I just don't have an appetite.

19
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,809
You should take a bite somehow.

20
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,369
Here.

21
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,969
Ning, look at what I've brought you.

22
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,379
I visited the breakfast shop
we used to frequent when we were young.

23
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,860
I brought their steamed pork buns here.

24
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,849
You actually found the shop?

25
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,610
I have to try it, then.

26
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,010
It's still the taste I remember.

27
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:34,498
Ri'an, Ze's porridge is delicious too.

28
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:35,529
Try it.

29
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,610
Ze.

30
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,809
These are my favorite steamed pork buns
when I was young. You should try them.

31
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,089
Try it.

32
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,330
It's okay, I guess.

33
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,450
It's nice.

34
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,458
It's nice, right?

35
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:05,610
What about the porridge I make?

36
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,770
This, and this,

37
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:10,778
throw all of these away.

38
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:11,338
Put them down.

39
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:13,050
- Throw this away as well.
- Put it down!

40
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,880
He's already gone.
Why are you still keeping his picture?

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,570
- What are you guys doing?
- Go away!

42
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,690

What are you doing?

48
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,570
The Feng Shui
of this house is pretty good.

49
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,169
I plan to move here.

50
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:46,010
So, you're tired of
pretending to be filial

51
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,618
just after a few days, huh?

52
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:48,690
Listen.

53
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,419
You have no permission to touch

54
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,729
everything that's in here.

55
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,219
I thought you never cared about him.

56
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,250
Who are you putting on a show for now?

57
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,698
Now, I'm the head of the family.
Of course I can move things around.

58
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,849
How dare you say that?

59
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,289
No choice. Legally speaking,
I'm the head of the family.

60
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,130
Half of the Yi family belongs to me now.

61
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,010
It's all thanks to your mother.

62
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,529
How dare you still mention her?

63
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,019
I'm thankful to her.

64
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,890
I!

65
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,169
- Let go!
- Let go!

66
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,210
Do you know how old you are?
You're as impatient as ever.

67
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,058
Fine. I won't move in today.

68
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,258
But I'm here to tell you

69
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,089
who the head of the family is right now.

70
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,570
Get out of my way!

71
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,770
Ms. Ning, don't be angry.

72
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,849
He's just an ingrate!

73
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,169
Move everything back!

74
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,130
Am I useless?

75
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,489
I can't even protect Grandpa's room.

76
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,770
You've already done well.
Qian Lei is just too despicable.

77
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,770
All the more I can't afford to fall.

78
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,409
Now, I'm the only person
left in the Yi family.

79
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,289
I have to protect Yi Yuan Group.

80
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,570
Ning, you still have me.

81
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:38,738
Grandpa already said so.
As long as I'm around,

82
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,810
you won't need to fight alone.

83
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,810
I'll always keep you company.

84
00:06:57,619 --> 00:07:00,729
She doesn't treat us as employees.

85
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:03,690
She criticizes us without
knowing the situation.

86
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,618
That's workplace bullying.

87
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,130
Yi Ning isn't someone like that.

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,969
Why are you butting in?

89
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,729
It's not like you work here every day.

90
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,370
How would you know
how she's managing the company?

91
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,419
Many colleagues from our department

92
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,178
have visited a psychiatrist.

93
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:19,330
All of us are depressed
in different ways.

94
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,210
There's no way for us to work.

95
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,089
As you all can see,

96
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,258
Yi Ning isn't suitable
as the CEO of the company.

97
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,570
Therefore, I suggest

98
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,459
we remove Yi Ning from
her position as the CEO.

99
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,289
- What's with the sudden decision?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,298
Why have I not received
any notifications

101
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:36,979
related to this BOD meeting

102
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,450
when I'm the largest shareholder?

103
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,010
I heard that you said
I bullied you at work.

104
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,729
Isn't that obvious enough?

105
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,529
Let's cast our votes.

106
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,219
Raise your hand
if you agree with removing Yi Ning

107
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,330
from her position.

108
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,810
Mr. Qian is looking at us.

109
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,969
The Yan family is in
the same boat as him.

110
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,890
You better come to your senses.

111
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,459
This isn't the time for you
to be caught in a love bubble.

112
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,609
Hurry and raise your hand.

113
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,609
But...

114
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,609
Do you want the Yan family to fall?

115
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,138
Hurry!

116
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,169
I forfeit my vote.

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,210
The votes in favor were just
one more than the votes against.

118
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,339
We shall pass the resolution.
We shall remove...

119
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,690
I have some shares as well.

120
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,129
I should have the right to vote.

121
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,538
- What is Li doing here?
- Yeah. What is he doing here?

122
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,530
I object.

123
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,219
(To thank the elders)

124
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,969
(who supported him all the way,)

125
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,440
(Mr. Yi implemented
an employee stock ownership plan.)

126
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:53,769
(We're lucky.)

127
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,339
Who was responsible for
the Guilinggao product line

128
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,210
when it incurred losses?

129
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,378
Who was the one
who made a profit with them?

130
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,618
I think it's your issue, Jiang Wenwen.

131
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,378
You're incompetent.

132
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,889
That's why you're spouting nonsense.

133
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,050
Let's stop and assess the situation.

134
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,930
Yeah. I think so too.

135
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,369
Dear uncles,

136
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,489
all of you watched over me as I grew up.

137
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,489
You all should know
that I'm not a bad guy.

138
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,609
Although I'm still new,

139
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,258
since Grandpa has handed
Yi Yuan Group to me,

140
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,699
I won't let it fall.

141
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,979
We should differentiate between
private and public affairs.

142
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,170
Fine. We'll talk with our results.

143
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,650
Next month, I'll give you guys a great
financial report of our performance.

144
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,729
Dear uncles, please give me a chance.

145
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,489
We're a family after all.

146
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,898
- Fine.
- Okay.

147
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,579
Fine. We'll wait for the results.

148
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,418
If the company
still incurs losses after this,

149
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:50,930
I'll resign from my position.

150
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,179
Mr. Li, thank you for believing in me.

151
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,819
It's my duty.

152
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,418
I can't just let them

153
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,009
bully a young girl like you.

154
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,930
You have to thank one more person.

155
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,378
Your husband found me in a hurry.

156
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,489
If not, I would have no idea.

157
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,729
Thank you.

158
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,009
You can do it.

159
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,170
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

160
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,459
You saved the damsel in distress

161
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,299
and protected her position as the CEO.

162
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,579
She should be grateful

163
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,810
and loyal to you now.

164
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,939
It's better for Yi Ning
to retain control of Yi Yuan Group.

165
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,138
Qian Lei has no bottom line.

166
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,570
He's hard to deal with.

167
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,819
So, are you in complete control

168
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,930
of Yi Ning right now?

169
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,210
She...

170
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,170
Do you think she's easy to control?

171
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,898
Look at how happy you're smiling.

172
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,418
I think you're under
her control instead.

173
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:29,099
You...

174
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,729
Shut up!

175
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,170
Am I?

176
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,690
Grandpa.

177
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,089
I almost lost Yi Yuan Group.

178
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,089
Am I useless?

179
00:11:58,739 --> 00:11:59,930
Of course not.

180
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,729
You've already done well.

181
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,089
Qian Lei is just too despicable.

182
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,489
You kept consoling me.

183
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,210
I'm not consoling you.
I'm stating facts.

184
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,579
I heard from Mr. Wen

185
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,810
you miss the Qingtuan
that your grandpa used to make.

186
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,650
I tried making it for you.

187
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,810
Try it. See if it's the taste you miss.

188
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:49,170
Stop crying.

189
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:01,650
It's as nice as the ones
Grandpa had made for me.

190
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,290
I'll make them for you in the future.

191
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:07,810
Ning.

192
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,650
I hope you don't behave
like this Qingtuan.

193
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,930
Don't wrap yourself up

194
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,650
and not give yourself
a chance to breathe.

195
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,450
Actually, I'm very scared

196
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,969
after Grandpa's passing.

197
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,170
In the past, no matter what I did,

198
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,889
he would support me.

199
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,570
But now, he's gone.

200
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:45,849
It feels like

201
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,369
one of my feet is stepping on thin air,

202
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,410
and I don't know where
to put my other foot.

203
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,290
It's as if you're falling,

204
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,729
but you can't afford to fall.

205
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,969
Don't be scared. I'm here for you.

206
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,530
I'm here for you in the future.

207
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,050
I'll always stay by your side.

208
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,530
Don't be scared. I'm here for you.

209
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,009
Ri'an,

210
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,050
can you take me in?

212
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,530
Dear, you're the head of the family now.

213
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,369
Why don't you arrange a room for him?

214
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,129
Don't you feel like

215
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,570
it's hot tonight?

216
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,729
