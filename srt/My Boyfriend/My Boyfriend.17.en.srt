Dad, are you sure about this?

15
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,139
If we get caught, we'll...

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,739
So what if we get caught?
What do you think we still have to lose?

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,578
I'm just worried about Yi Ning's temper.

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,018
What if she refuses?

19
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,569
I don't believe she'd risk her life.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,089
When the time comes, move quickly.

21
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:06,250
You hear me?

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,529
Got it.

23
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,809
Boss!

24
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,339
When is the person
we're waiting for getting here?

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,770
What's the rush? Be patient.

26
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,738
Why are you in such a hurry?

27
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:29,809
Someone's coming.

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,169
Shen Qianze?

29
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,178
Whatever, if we
can't get Yi Ning, he'll do.

30
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:42,089
Get him!

31
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,410
Move!

32
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,770
That way.

33
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:02,378
Where'd you find these guys?

34
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,729
Qian Family Village.

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,010
Mr. Lei, I think he's waking up.

36
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,170
It's you.

37
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,929
Looks like you weren't beaten senseless.

38
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,249
Shen Qianze.

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,178
I'll give you a chance.

40
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:52,298
Be my man.
You'll cook for me, do my laundry...

41
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,369
- Forget it, keep dreaming.
- That way, I could...

42
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,369
Tie him up!

43
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,570
Stop wasting time talking to him.

44
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,610
Shen Qianze, you'd better behave.

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,849
As long as Yi Ning
brings the share transfer agreement,

46
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,738
I'll let you go.

47
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,809
Like Yi Ning would actually come here.

48
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,570
(I'll have to save myself)

49
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,730
Don't be naive.

50
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,330
Yi Ning would trade Yi Yuan to save me?

51
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,018
Would you trade Yi Yuan

52
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,099
for Jiang Xinlian?

53
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,170
I...

54
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,529
Stop trying to drive a wedge between us!

55
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:35,450
My parents truly love each other!

56
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,770
Tie him up!

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,610
But not Yi Ning and me.

58
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,178
I'm just her contract husband.

59
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,089
The only thing
she cares about is Yi Yuan.

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,529
There's no way she'd come here!

61
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,659
Then I'll make the whole world see

62
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,058
that the CEO of Yi Yuan

63
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,298
is someone who sees lives as worthless.

64
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,929
You think she hasn't considered that?

65
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:06,689
Qian Lei, your perfect plan just failed.

66
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,129
If I were you,

67
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,929
I'd think carefully
about working with me.

68
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,770
I might actually help you.

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,019
Dad, don't fall for it.

70
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,498
Guys who look good like him
are the best liars.

71
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:19,729
Still trying to fool me?

72
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,890
Qian Lei, don't forget
where you are right now.

73
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,178
You're nothing but a stray dog.

74
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,938
You've got no other choice
but to trust me.

75
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:29,969
Shut up!

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,089
Qian Lei!

77
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,450
Let him go!

78
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:35,330
I'm here.

79
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,010
(She actually came.)

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,659
(Why?)

81
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,729
Where's the stuff?

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,498
- Ning, don't worry about me.
- Don't move!

83
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,840
- Get out of here!
- Don't move!

84
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,030
(Share Transfer Agreement)

85
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:49,210
Go!

86
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,690
You'd better not try anything funny.

87
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:01,930
Don't worry about me, Ning.

88
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,130
Dad, it's real.

89
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,010
Yi Ning.

90
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,659
Didn't expect you to be different

91
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,330
from that money-hungry woman Yi An.

92
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,738
You're actually someone loyal and kind.

93
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,450
You got what you wanted.

94
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,618
Can I have Shen Qianze back now?

95
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,779
Cancel the lawsuit first.

96
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,979
Release him first!

97
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,089
Tie him up!

98
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,130
No! Don't get worked up.

99
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,210
Stop trying to bargain with me.

100
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,130
Hello, Ms. Yi?

101
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:51,010
Secretary Liu, we're
dropping the charges. Cancel everything.

102
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,690
That's more like it.

103
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,690
Now can you let him go?

104
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:57,849
You're seriously letting him go?

105
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,330
Dad, someone's coming.

106
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,659
We've got what we wanted.

107
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,058
Let's just get out of here.

108
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,339
I'll double your pay!

109
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,570
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

110
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,010
Boss, what do we do?

111
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,529
Run!

112
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:21,219
Ze!

113
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,649
Stop! Don't run!

114
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:24,378
Stop!

115
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,409
Ze!

116
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:26,178
Stop!

117
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,250
Are you okay?

118
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,010
Ze...

119
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,409
Don't scare me.

120
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,729
Someone help! Somebody!

121
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,330
Don't move. I don't want to hurt you.

122
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,729
Are you okay?

123
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,210
It's fake.

124
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,298
Ning. There's something
I've been meaning to ask.

125
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,849
Why did you come that day?

126
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,250
You knew it was a trap.

127
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,729
I knew it was a trap.

128
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,810
But you were the bait,
how could I not go?

129
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,680
But now Yi Yuan is in Qian Lei's hands.

130
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,609
Even if I lost Yi Yuan,
I could win it back.

131
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,649
But I can't lose you.

132
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,130
If anything had happened to you,

133
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,450
then I...
I wouldn't have any family left.

138
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,130
So, what are you planning
to treat me to today?

139
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,169
That depends on how well he performs.

140
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,570
I'm already full
just watching you two being lovey-dovey.

141
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,690
Ning.

142
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,859
Shen Qianze's got pretty good taste.

143
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,178
Of course he does.

144
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:31,729
Why else do you think I chose him?

145
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,969
Do you smell something kind of weird?

146
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,009
No, nothing.

147
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,018
Everything about this place is great

148

Ugh, stop it.

151
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,170
Ning, come on, sit here.

152
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,889
Are you hungry?

153
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,378
Wait, maybe you two
should flirt a bit longer.

154
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,618
I'll see myself out.

155
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,969
Please sit.

you wanted scallion oil chicken rice.

157
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,299
I've been practicing it
these past few days.

158
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,570
I'll make it for you later.

159
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,050
Really?

160
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,810
Thank you, Ze.

161
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,179
Can you add two more dishes?

162
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,410
I also invited Mr. Su.

163
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,969
Ze?

164
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:35,290
You're the man, brother-in-law.

Ning

166
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,738
has never called anyone's name

167
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:40,290
in such a sweet tone before.

168
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,290
Alright, I'll get back to work.

169
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:53,699
Wow, I can't believe it.

170
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,618
Back then,

171
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:56,819
you were like an AI programmed for work.

172
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,939
No emotions at all.

173
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,699
But now, look at you. Crazy in love,

174
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,618
all clingy and affectionate.

175
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,738
What? A strong woman can't fall in love?

176
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,210
I'm happy for you.

177
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:11,210
You've finally become
a little more human.

178
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,179
Was I really that bad before?

179
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,618
Only I could put up with you, okay?

180
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,618
You used to...

181
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,520
What are you two
chatting about, so happily?

- Hello.

185
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,898
Mr. Su, about what happened earlier,

186
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,570
I haven't had a chance to thank you.

187
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:28,729
No need.

188
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,459
By the way, everything's okay
with Yi Yuan now, right?

189
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,498
All good.

190
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,219
Thanks for helping me
find someone back then,

191
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,609
and for saving the recording.

192
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,658
I believe

193
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,179
the police are already
following legal procedure.

194
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,849
The agreement
I gave Qian Lei won't be valid.

195
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,810
Weren't you afraid
the plan would backfire,

196
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,939
and Yi Yuan would really
end up in his hands?

197
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,170
Sometimes you have to take a gamble.

198
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:51,810
Right?

199
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,489
I'll leave you two to talk.
I'm going to check on Ze.

200
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:10,089
So you planned all of this?

201
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,618
I really thought
you were just crazy in love.

202
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:13,729
I love him,

203
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,690
but that doesn't mean
I'd do something stupid.

204
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,410
Alright, you're always right.

205
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:24,570
Uncle...

206
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,450
Mr. Su is here.

207
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,418
You staged that kidnapping stunt

208
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,018
without telling me first?

209
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,258
Even if it worked, it was way too risky.

210
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,769
- It wasn't an act.
- You...

211
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,179
What?

212
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,179
I never imagined

213
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,898
Yi Ning would trade the company for me.

214
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,450
How could I plan for that?

215
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,170
But it does prove you've got her
in the palm of your hand.

216
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,889
Ze.

217
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,898
You could totally

218
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,538
use her love for you to control her

219
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,769
and take Yi Yuan.

220
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:58,330
Uncle... I don't really
want revenge anymore.

221
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,609
What do you mean?

222
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,330
She said I'm her family.

223
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,258
And because of her, I slowly remembered

224
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,609
what it feels like to be cared for.

225
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:12,570
Right now, I want to love her
more than I want to hate her.

226
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,018
But have you thought about this?

227
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,018
Your relationship

228
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,219
was built on a lie from the beginning.

229
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,498
If she finds out

230
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,290
you were lying to her from day one,

231
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,570
do you think she'll still love you?

232
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,249
I...

233
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,898
We've come this far, Ze.

234
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,089
Don't do something you'll regret.

235
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,369
Don't worry.
If you can't bring yourself to do it,

236
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,369
I'll do it for you.

237
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,530
What do you mean, you...

238
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:48,889
Cheers.

239
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,579
Yue, try this.

240
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,339
As a female celebrity,

241
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,129
- I guess I'm only allowed to eat vegetables, right?
- Ms. Yi...

242
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,330
- Do you know...
- Ning.

243
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,690
What's wrong?

244
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,170
My head hurts a little.

245
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,170
Is it bad?

246
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,138
Sorry.

247
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,170
Maybe we should call it a night.

248
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,618
No worries, go ahead.

249
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,969
Health comes first.

250
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,210
Let's go.

251
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:28,769
Be careful on the way.

252
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,650
Should we keep eating?

253
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,729
Mr. Wen.

254
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,210
Mr. Shen is back.

255
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,618
Did we have a guest today?

256
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,339
Yes.

257
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,138
Chairman Su of Shangsu Group

258
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,450
came to visit Ms. Ning.

259
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,290
So he was like that even as a kid.

260
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,729
Ze, you're here. What's wrong?

261
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,050
Why is Mr. Su here?

262
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,990
(Next Episode)

263
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,330
She's just a woman, that's all.

264
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,969
You've got Yi Yuan in your hands.
What's there to worry about?

265
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,089
Ze.

266
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:16,658
It's time to reel it in.

267
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,810
Please answer our questions.

268
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:22,179
Please say something.

269
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,339
Give us a response.

270
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,538

271
