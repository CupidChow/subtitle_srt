= Episode 26 =

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,590
Are you Miss Long from the Silver City?

33
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,060
Yes.

34
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,570
How dare you are!

35
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,570
Bow to Her Highness!

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,130
I didn’t expect
to see Mother of Prince Zhao here.

37
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,900
I am Long Aoyi.

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,730
Great honor to see you.

39
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,660
Sorry for my lack of courtesy.

40
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,860
I knew about you

41
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,500
after Zhao’s trip to the Silver City.

42
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,330
I didn’t expect

43
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,290
a girl growing up at the whorehouse

44
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,860
could really make a difference.

45
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,770
But Zhao stole one Xinluo Purple Ginseng

46
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,550
from me that day.

47
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,590
This ginseng is a rare treasure.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,220
So I decided to meet you.

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,100
I have recovered so quickly

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,970
thanks to this magic medicine!

51
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,370
Your Highness,

52
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,570
don’t blame Prince Zhao for it.

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,970
If the Xin…

54
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,900
the medicine was eaten by me,

55
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,660
I am to blame for it

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,100
and I will make money and repay you.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,830
I have seen numerous people

58
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,330
and I can read their minds

59
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,590
whoever they are.

60
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,250
But it is the first time for me

61
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,690
to see

62
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,460
such a low and poorly-educated girl

63
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,540
with a mediocre look.

64
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,660
Please show your respect to others.

65
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,410
How dare

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,130
you offend Her Highness!

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,750
Give her thirty whips

68
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,970
to teach her courtesy.

69
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,770
Let go of her.

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,210
Mother, don’t be angry.

71
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,580
How dare a low person

72
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,180
treat me so rudely and arrogantly!

73
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,410
She deserves a penalty of whipping.

74
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,130
Mother,

75
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,740
I apologize

76
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,970
for Miss Long’s lack of courtesy.

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,990
I am to blame for all her faults.

78
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,740
Miss Long’s wound hasn’t healed.

79
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,540
I have to take her back for a rest now.

80
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,280
We can talk later.

81
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,920
Let’s go.

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,130
Stop, Zhao.

83
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,180
It is a talk between you two.

84
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,370
I can go back myself.

85
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,900
Look, her real personality is exposed.

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,300
Start to show weakness before Zhao.

87
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,800
Listen,

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,670
this is just an old trick.

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,510
Mother,

90
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,200
Miss Long isn’t that kind of person.

91
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,670
I am just taking care of her.

92
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,430
Take care?

93
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,320
Despite your occasional unruliness,

94
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,820
you have always behaved yourself

95
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,120
before me.

96
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,000
But you stole my treasure

97
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,750
simply for this low girl.

98
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,040
You have never hidden anything from me.

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,430
But

100
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,200
you hid her here.

101
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Is that taking care?

102
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,830
I know what you mean.

103
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,270
I will pack up and leave here now.

104
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,640
Don’t go away.

105
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,990
We are brothers.

106
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Nothing needs to be kept secret.

107
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,480
Anyway,

108
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,720
you have a kind son.

109
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,120
He saved my life.

110
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,200
I will repay him in the future.

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
As your good friend,

112
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,160
I don’t expect to see you in a dilemma.

113
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,270
I have to leave first.

114
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,600
Aoyi!

115
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,150
Zhao.

116
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,330
Friend, brother?

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,990
You have

118
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,990
a yearning for that low girl.

119
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,490
It is pure love.

120
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
Do you consider the consequences?

121
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,700
Just blames and penalties from Father.

122
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,790
Blames and penalties?

123
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,220
I am afraid I have to die for it.

124
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,290
Our fortunes are linked together.

125
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,260
Do you expect me to lose favor for you?

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,880
Do you know

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,670
how many people I have offended

128
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,640
just for you in the past years?

129
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,340
= Xuanshi Palace =

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,950
How are Prince Jun’s performances

131
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
these days?

132
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,000
According to intelligence,

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,240
Prince Jun was impeached to have ignored

134
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,750
political orders in his effort
to stabilize flavor prices at the market,

135
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,240
and further impeached by the Secretariat

136
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,600
for failure to hand over the direct order

137
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,680
to his successor at night watch
in the palace.

138
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,630
He was impeached twice

139
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,720
just for small trivia.

140
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,770
I don’t think

141
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,160
Prince Jun is qualified

142
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,950
for his duties at court.

143
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,360
How about Long Aoyi?

144
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,270
Xiaoqin asked me to tell you

145
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,120
Miss Long has recovered quickly.

146
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,680
She has moved out of
the Mansion of Prince Zhao

147
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,270
and settled down at Qinglong Firm.

148
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,800
Great!

149
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,800
Qingliu.

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,560
Why didn’t you tell me you were back?

151
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
I had many things to do

152
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
as a new comer here

153
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,600
and so I didn’t have time to notify you.

154
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,720
Sorry.

155
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,480
I didn’t mean to blame you.

156
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,560
I have prepared some gifts

157
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,630
and hope to give them to you soonest.

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
You favor tea,

159
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,430
so I asked them to bake back

160
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,310
Meng Ding Gan Lu from Sichuan.

161
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,430
Look at

162
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,240
this jar of plums.

163
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,630
You can make your favorite

164
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,830
black truffle gold-soup fish with them.

165
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,270
Great.

166
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,600
I will ask the cook
to make it at home tomorrow.

167
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,390
You have come here in a hurry this time

168
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,240
and forgotten many things.

169
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,660
I have had them delivered here too.

170
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,800
Xiaoxian,

171
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,270
you don’t have
to take such great troubles.

172
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,680
Just take me as your family.

173
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
I did it

174
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,600
voluntarily before.

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,750
It is also my obligation

176
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,870
to do it now.

177
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,830
I thought of this book recently.

178
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,720
I need to read it carefully.

179
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,600
Miss.

180
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
You are dismissed.

181
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,270
Yes.

182
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,850
Got any message?

183
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,290
They said she had woken up

184
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,650
and almost recovered.

185
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,940
She has left the Mansion of Prince Zhao.

186
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,730
The Mansion of Prince Jun will certainly

187
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,090
open to her.

188
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,970
I think

189
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,090
it is time to take further actions if

190
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,620
His Majesty already ordered the marriage.

191
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,780
= Dongshi Market =

192
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,090
Master hasn’t been well these days.

193
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,770
I am worried about her.

194
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,460
- What is up?
- What’s up?

195
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,170
Go ahead.

196
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,330
Go ahead. You…

197
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,700
Our brothers at the quay said

198
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,380
the first boat had already arrived.

199
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,900
The second boat

200
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,750
would arrive soon.

201
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,580
Great!

202
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,460
- Brothers in Water Gang did a great job.
- Fill it.

203
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,380
Come on!

204
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,350
Come on!

205
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,700
Arrival of the third boat

206
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,620
will prove the grain transport courses

207
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,170
nearby have been established

208
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,860
and large-scale transport

209
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,650
can start soon.

210
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,980
Great!

211
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,560
The first consignment has arrived.

212
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,040
As Master instructed,

213
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,770
we need to work with

214
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,220
brothers of the Water Gang

215
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,100
to unload the goods and try to move them

216
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,620
into the warehouse tonight so that we can

217
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,020
have a good beginning tomorrow morning.

218
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,860
Okay.

219
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,140
Lower your voice.

220
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,620
Master is having a rest indoors.

221
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,220
Are you enjoying the moon late at night?

222
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,980
I

223
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,650
presume Her Highness must have
blamed you again.

224
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,140
I am coming to comfort you.

225
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,340
Propose a toast

226
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,140
to the moon and the shadow.

227
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Great, let me have a drink with you.

228
00:11:59,690 --> 00:11:59,930
Cheers!

229
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,510
Cheers!

230
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,810
Tell me

231
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,500
if Her Highness hasn’t blamed you indeed.

232
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,860
In the past twenty-plus years,

233
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,900
I have offended Mother again and again.

234
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,650
She is justified

235
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,020
however hard she may criticize me.

236
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,020
Don’t blame yourself that way.

237
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,170
In the past years,

238
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,260
I have witnessed your obedience

239
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,290
and filial piety to Her Highness.

240
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,500
I am not an obedient son.

241
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,170
So I always try to respect her wishes.

242
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,410
But I am an undisciplined

243
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,570
and unambitious person

244
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,860
although I am a royal member.

245
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,680
Having a son like me

246
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,860
is her misfortune indeed.

247
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,170
You are a liberty pursuer.

248
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,530
But you have no other choice.

249
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,100
I know the deadly competitions at court.

250
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,530
I feel so sorry for her

251
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,860
but can’t protect her.

252
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,220
So I can do nothing but

253
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,980
become her puppet at her disposal.

254
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,260
I can’t object to her order

255
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,860
despite my reluctance.

256
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,290
I used to

257
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,170
take this life for granted

258
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,410
and dare not ask for more.

259
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:26,860
But Miss Long

260
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,410
has brightened up

261
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,380
everything for me

262
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,900
since I got to know her.

263
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,770
She offers another probability

264
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,100
and a kind of life

265
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,020
I have never imagined

266
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,860
For the first time,

267
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,450
I told myself

268
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,530
to stop here

269
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,450
forgetting the past
and ignoring the future.

270
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,690
Only at this moment

271
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,810
will our hearts resonate with each other

272
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,740
and it is enough for me.

273
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,380
Cheers!

274
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,740
As the poem of Li Bai goes,

275
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,980
let’s have a sorrow-free friendship

276
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,570
and meet at the farthest of the universe.

277
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,650
Come on,

278
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,570
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

279
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,410
It is the opening day

280
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,570
of Qinglong Firm in Chang’an.

281
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,100
Let’s invite Master Long

282
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,340
to unveil it personally.

283
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,900
- Three, two, one.
- Great.

284
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,060
= Qinglong Firm =

285
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:14,140
Good.

286
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,930
Beautiful.

287
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,020
Good.

288
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,100
Let’s relax ourselves later.

289
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay.

290
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,050
Do you mean the gamble house?

291
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,930
I am really fed up with the days

292
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,380
at Prince Zhao’s Mansion.

293
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,410
Okay, let’s go after a while.

294
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,810
Thanks for your supports.

295
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,220
Great.

296
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,570
We have some gifts for you.

297
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,150
Great.

298
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,520
Great.

299
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,990
- Thanks.
- Come on.

300
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,180
Congratulations!

301
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,540
Congratulations! Congratulations!

302
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,170
= Usher in Spring =
Miss Long.

303
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,740
= Usher in Spring =

304
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,570
Miss Long.

305
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,650
Xiangyue.

306
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,690
- Miss Long, Xiaoqin.
- Great.

307
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,690
It is really you!

308
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,020
I finally know it is so boisterous here

309
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,800
as it is the opening day of your business.

310
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,160
Why are you in Chang’an too?

311
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,470
After your departure,

312
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,640
a foreign dance troupe
passed by the Silver City.

313
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,320
I thought Feng had…

314
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,350
So I joined the dance troupe

315
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,570
and left the Silver City.

316
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Then I arrived in Chang’an.

317
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,990
Do you make more
than you did in the Silver City?

318
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,070
Much more.

319
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,750
For instance,

320
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,300
a high-ranking official will hold

321
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,280
a feast at home today.

322
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Our troupe is invited to perform there.

323
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,830
It seems aristocrats and dignitaries

324
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,950
of the capital city are
invited to attend it.

325
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,200
It is a good chance to look for

326
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
the cyprinus carpiod charts there.

327
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,640
- This way, please.
- Okay.

328
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,200
Great.

329
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,460
= Qinglong Firm =

330
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,960
Everybody.

331
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,910
It is

332
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,510
a great day today.

333
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,630
I feel highly honored

334
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,790
to have the Consort Dowager,

335
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,320
Prince Zhao, Prince Jun

336
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,590
and other officials at home today.

337
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,000
It is a feast against corruption.

338
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,620
At this moment of each year,

339
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,240
I will hold a feast here

340
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,900
to keep reminding myself

341
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,790
of the code of conducts as an official and

342
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,510
be a corruption-free
and impartial official.

343
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,120
It is not liquor in the cup.

344
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,200
It is the Fresh Air Dew made of good rain.

345
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,320
Let’s drink it and toast

346
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,750
to the affluent good fortune

347
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,120
of our Tang Dynasty.

348
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,910
Dear all,

349
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I have also prepared some singing and

350
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,600
dancing performances for you all

351
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,960
as an aide to the drink.

352
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,360
Good.

353
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,000
Your Highness.

354
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,030
What is that?

355
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,480
Grandmother,

356
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,320
it is Guidebao,

357
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,440
originating from the Silver City,

358
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,910
and is used to protect the knees

359
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,480
during kneeling and dancing.

360
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,510
It is a good thing.

361
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,070
Tell them

362
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,440
to purchase some

363
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,070
for our servants.

364
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,920
Yes.

365
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,160
Grandmother, cheers.

366
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,310
Okay.

367
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,960
Prince Zhao is almost 20 years old.

368
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,590
I will pick two servant girls
for you later.

369
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,730
Grandmother,

370
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,520
I just want to have one person today.

371
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,440
Which girl

372
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,590
do you

373
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,420
favor?

374
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,760
I prefer this foreign dancer.

375
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,550
Pretty and good dancing.

376
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,840
Grandmother,
I would also propose you a toast.

377
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,790
Do you also prefer this foreign dancer?

378
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,400
Exactly!

379
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay.

380
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,790
To make it fair,

381
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,070
you can

382
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
dance with this girl

383
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,680
together.

384
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,350
Whoever dances better will own this girl.

385
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,990
Mr. Yuan,

386
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,790
my two grandsons

387
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,230
want to dance with this foreign dancer.

388
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,470
Please make an arrangement.

389
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,440
Your Highness,

390
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,680
I am afraid it isn’t appropriate

391
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,640
for princes to dance with a dancer.

392
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,470
What?

393
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,700
Do you oppose to my wish?

394
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,160
Don’t I

395
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,030
have the right for it?

396
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,860
Yes, yes.

397
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,880
Your Highness,

398
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,310
I will arrange right away.

399
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,470
Grandmother, let me do it first.

400
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,710
Zhao,

401
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,990
your dance with her

402
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,880
isn’t harmonious obviously.

403
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
I am sorry for my poor skills.

404
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,160
Jun, it is your turn now.

405
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,440
Grandmother, I will start now.

411
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,310
The Mansion of Prince Jun will
certainly open to her.

412
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,310
It is time to take further actions if

413
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,950

Jun has won the girl.

426
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,840

428
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,470
Your Highness,

429
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,710
I am already used to the life
on the foreign land.

430
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,990
although I am a low servant.

431
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,640
I don’t feel good

432
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,740
to be at the disposal of others.

433
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
It is a great pity

434
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,680
and meaningless

435
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,780
if I can’t even

436
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,080
determine

437
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,880
my future.

438
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,640
So

439
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,400
I sincerely hope Your Highness
can take back your decree.

440
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,310
As a resident from the crude region,

441
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,240
I hope you won’t mind my offence.

442
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,160
How dare you are!

443
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,110
Somebody,

444
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,080
arrest this foreign girl.

445
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,880
Stop!

446
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,920
She is really an interesting girl.

447
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,880
I love it.

448
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,320
I will take back my decree.

449
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,470
But you must drink with Jun

450
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,710
as you have let him down.

451
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,270
Okay, it is just a cup of liquor.

452
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,950
Congratulations to Prince Jun

453
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,790
on entering the court
and getting a pretty girl.

454
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,030
Wait!

455
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,030
What?

456
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,270
Do you oppose to it?

457
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,880
No, it is…

458
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,160
It is just a cup of liquor.

459
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,440
You should be more inclusive

460
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,750
as the future hostess
of the Mansion of Prince Jun.

461
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,510
Calm down, Your Highness.

462
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,640
She is worried about Prince Jun’s health.

463
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,200
she is afraid drinking may harm him.

464
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,270
What nonsense!

465
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,360
How can you be the hostess

466
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,310
of the mansion of Prince Jun
in the future?

467
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,680
Thank you for the advice, Your Highness!

468
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,950
Xiaoxian.

469
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,270
Your Highness,

470
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,920
I must leave first

471
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,160
and prepare other programs.

472
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,230
Grandmother, Mr. Yuan,

473
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,990
I am not good at drinking.

474
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,600
I can’t drink much with you all,

475
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,790
so I have to leave first.

476
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:52,920
Okay.

477
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,950
Grandmother,

478
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,550
I visited the mansion today and

479
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,550
felt it has really marvelous decorations.

480
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,790
I hope to take a walk in the garden.

481
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,920
Okay, go as you please.

482
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,990
Your Highness, please enjoy the music.

483
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
I was really startled just now.

484
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,710
Guidebao fell off directly.

485
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,920
Luckily I was quick enough

486
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,990
to catch it.

487
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,270
This liquor seems

488
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,270
to have a problem.

489
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,710
I am so dizzy.

490
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,880
We all drank the liquors.

491
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,960
- We are okay.
- Yes.

492
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,310
Did you make too many turns just now?

493
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,000
I think

494
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,570
you must have got dizzy

495
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,500
after dancing with both princes.

496
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,770
Nonsense!

497
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,750
I want to go out for fresh air.

498
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,000
Let me go out with you.

499
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,590
Thanks. I can manage it myself.

500
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,880
Just come back earlier.

501
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,590
We need to rehearse the next dance.

502
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,680
Okay.

503
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,390
Who is hiding there secretly?

504
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,480
Your Highness!

505
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,960
Follow me.

506
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,660
= Mansion of Prime Minister =

507
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,030
Your Highness!

508
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,000
Coachman,

509
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,310
go to Mansion of Prince Jun.

510
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,110
Yes.

511
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,110
No, Aoyi,

512
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
I need to take you back first.

513
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,200
Shut up!

514
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Get him back to the Mansion of Prince Jun.

515
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,710
Yes.

516
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,030
I am the fourth son of the emperor.

517
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,030
Follow my instructions.

518
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,080
Aoyi, where do you live?

519
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Tell the coachman.

520
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,080
He will take you back first.

521
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,510
Okay, take me
to the Mansion of Prince Zhao.

522
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,160
Yes.

523
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,640
What? Mansion of Prince Zhao?

524
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,360
Aoyi,

525
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,030
I pay you

526
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,230
for the best inn in Chang’an.

527
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,160
Don’t go to the Mansion of Prince Zhao.

528
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,750
Don’t meet Prince Zhao.

529
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,550
Coachman,

530
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,400
take us to the best inn in Chang’an.

531
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,380
Yes.

532
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:37,380
= Mansion of Prime Minster =

533
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,520
Your Highness!

534
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,510
Talk to me later.

535
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,400
I have no time now.

536
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,990
Your Highness!

537
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,510
Are you looking for Long Aoyi?

538
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,440
How do you know it?

539
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,640
Qingliu will never have such expressions

540
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,400
unless it is for her.

541
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,360
What else do you know?

542
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,470
I can’t find Qingliu.

543
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,030
I don’t think you will find Long Aoyi.

544
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,440
But you must find them tonight,

545
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,950
Your Highness!

546
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,640
Why?

547
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,310
I...

548
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,990
I put some drugs in the liquor.

549
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,120
The liquor

550
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,310
can make people lose mind.

551
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,160
You…

552
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,600
Wu Lin,

553
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,880
Your Highness!

554
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,230
Prepare a carriage for me.

555
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,310
Rush to the Mansion of Prince Jun now.

556
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:35,680
Hurry up!

557
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,120
Yes.

558
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,470
Wait.

559
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,270
Dispatch someone to Qinglong Firm

560
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,950
and wait for Miss Long.

561
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,710
Notify me if you have any message.

562
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,600
Yes.

563
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,270
Go.

564
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,900
= Tianxian Restaurant =

565
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,310
It is so hot.

566
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,750
Have you forgotten me?

567
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,230
I don’t remember you anyway.
I don’t remember.

568
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,470
I wrote a long, long letter to you.

569
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,030
Letter?

570
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,160
Why did you write me a letter?

571
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,750
I must marry you in my life.

572
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,400
Aoyi,

573
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,200
whatever happened last night,

574
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,790
I will

575
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,230
take responsibility

576
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,200
for you.

577
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,360
Don’t pretend

578
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,270
to be a good man.

579
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,440
Nobody expects you to take responsibility.

580
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
What responsibility can you take?

581
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,600
Frankly,

582
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,030
I have grown up among the whorehouses

583
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,080
in the Silver City for years.

584
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,710
I have seen all types of men

585
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,710
and all sorts of occasions.

586
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,600
It is not a big deal.

587
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,190
Just forget it.

588
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,200
It is the story of a drunk girl.

589
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,710
I have forgotten it. You too.

590
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,830
How can you compare me to

591
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,830
those whoremasters?

592
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,040
All of you are bad men.

593
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,910
What is the difference?

594
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:54,830
Okay.

595
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,640
Whatever kind of person you take me as

596
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,680
and however you consider it,

597
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,560
I will certainly be responsible for it

598
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,560
and for you!

599
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,830
Okay, please tell me

600
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,910
how can an engaged person

601
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,960
take responsibility.

602
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,230
If you can’t,

603
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,040
never promise so easily.

604
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,620
= Tang =
= Northern Gate =

605
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,830
Five reports

606
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,710
about the same story

607
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,480
of Prince Jun spending a night
with a foreign dancer

608
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,960
and leaving the inn

609
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,270
hastily and disheveled the next morning.

610
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,870
Liu Chang,

611
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,120
you are the recorder

612
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,960
of the prince’s words and conducts.

613
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,000
Do you know about it?

614
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,270
Your Majesty!

615
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,160
Prince Jun’s romance story

616
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,520
in the capital city last night

617
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,000
is highly ridiculous.

618
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,430
There have been lots of gossips

619
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,210
about it in Chang’an recently.

620
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,520
How to deal with it according to the law?

621
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,250
Your Majesty!

622
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,040
Considering the identity of Prince Jun,

623
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,200
either condemnation

624
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,430
or

625
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,390
whipping may be applicable.

626
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,910
Your Majesty, I have some advice.

627
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,390
Go ahead.

628
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,040
Our state has an open atmosphere.

629
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,310
It has been common for officials

630
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,640
to have love affairs
since the beginning of our state.

631
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,270
How can we punish a prince

632
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
just for a love affair?

633
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,430
Your Majesty, it is true that love affairs

634
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,640
have been common among
officials for long.

635
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,200
But a prince of Tang

636
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,640
having such a bad habit

637
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,430
is really a shame to the royal family.

638
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,050
Your Majesty!

639
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,750
Prince Jun is still young

640
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,480
and therefore

641
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,830
was lured by that evil girl

642
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,600
and did something wrong.

643
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,380
The evil girl is to blame

644
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,140
for her desire to move upwards.

645
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,870
I personally believe

646
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,040
Prince Jun shall be excused

647
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,230
while the evil girl shall be whipped

648
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,830
as a warning to imitators.

649
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,270
Calm down, Father.

650
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,830
It’s obvious that Li Qingliu
did it purposefully.

651
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,870
If the girl is punished instead,

652
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,560
it is putting the cart before the horse

653
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,040
and will only cause public indignation.

654
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,580
Suffering whipping for flattering a prince

655
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,710
is nothing different from Shi Chong

656
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,680
who decapitated the girl failing to persuade
guests to drink in the West Jin Dynasty.

657
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,160
Please take a second thought, Father.

658
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Father.

659
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,910
The girl you are talking about now

660
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,710
is neither a dancer nor a prostitute.

661
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,510
She is my acquaintance in the Silver City.

662
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,510
We have been together for long

663
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,870
