Greetings, Miss Du.

34
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,010
Why are you still here now?

35
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,290
I got up late, but next time…

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,540
No, no more next time.

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,500
Lady, according to the rules,

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,860
being late for work,

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,900
she should be fined one-third
of her salary.

40
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,500
Miss Du, I…

41
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,770
Maybe being late means nothing to you.

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,380
But have you ever thought

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,450
it’s disrespectful to those

44
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,460
who go to work on time?

45
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,010
It may even affect their moods and

46
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,010
lead to low efficiency while working.

47
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,570
Yes, my lady.

48
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,900
But your salary won’t be deducted
this month.

49
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,690
If you were late again,

50
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,050
you wouldn’t be forgiven.

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,250
Yes, it won’t happen again.

52
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,370
You look so tired recently

53
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,650
with dark eye circles.

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,050
Later I’ll ask Yue’er to bring
some facial cream to you.

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,010
Let the workers like you apply it
before sleep.

56
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,970
Seriously?

57
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,220
Thanks, Miss Du. Thanks.

58
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,970
Go to work now.

59
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,610
Yes.

60
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,970
Lady.

61
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,690
Li Jun’er is always lazy on weekdays.

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,850
This time she was finally caught out.

63
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,850
Why did you spare her so easily?

64
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,970
You’ve told me that

65
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,940
it’s not a proper way
to suppress them blindly.

66
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,940
Being more tolerant,

67
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,970
I can draw the workers in.

68
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,130
Long Aoyi can make it.

69
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,740
So can I.

70
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,490
Boring!

71
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,740
Boring!

72
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,900
There’s even no one to talk with
in the day.

73
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,410
So boring!

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,250
Oh dear!

75
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,940
Dear me!

76
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,020
Feng.

77
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,210
Your Highness.

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,020
God.

79
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,210
Hurry, hurry! Why are you here?

80
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,850
It’s fine today.

81
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,460
I’m looking forward to your return.

82
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,770
I’ve just come back from Qimen Temple

83
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,490
and got here first.

84
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,540
Great.

85
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,610
I heard

86
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,020
all the notices to arrest Miss Long

87
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,180
had been removed.

88
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,050
Well, where is she now?

89
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,740
She is not in today.

90
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,410
Not in?

91
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,970
Is there anything unsettled?

92
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,330
No, there isn’t.

93
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,740
Take it easy.

94
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,700
That’s good.

95
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,860
Then where did she go?

96
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,930
When she was absent,

97
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,610
many things happened in the gang.

98
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,330
There are so many matters that

99
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,530
she has to solve them one by one.

100
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,140
Your Highness,

101
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,580
what if I ask the girls to prepare
some alcohol

102
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,900
and we have a drink?

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,090
Not today.

104
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,610
I’ll go somewhere else to look for her.

105
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,650
Let’s make it

106
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,810
another day.

107
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,810
Alright.

108
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,610
Bye, Your Highness!

109
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,650
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

110
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,140
Is Miss Long here?

111
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,260
- No.
- She’s not here.

112
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,330
But we are.

113
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,460
Go.

114
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,260
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

115
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,050
Go.

116
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,580
- Wu Lin! Wu Lin!
- Let’s go.

117
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:22,930
Wu Lin!

118
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,700
Why not stay with us, Your Highness?

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,210
Your Highness!

120
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,900
Your Highness!

121
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,740
Is Miss Long here today?

122
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,420
No.

123
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,300
But we are.

124
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,860
Why not stay with us, Your Highness?

125
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,090
No!

126
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,050
No! No! No!

127
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,210
There is the door.

128
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,180
This way, please.

129
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,860
Thanks. Thanks.

130
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
What’s wrong?

131
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,340
We came back earlier today.

132
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,730
But why is there no one working?

133
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,410
Master.

134
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,900
- Feng.
- Is the store closed today?

135
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,660
So strange.

136
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,340
Feng would take a day off
rather than make money.

137
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,570
There is nobody in. Where are they going?

138
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,300
Here I am.

139
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,810
Here I am.

140
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

141
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,020
Why are you here?

142
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,420
Miss Long, I’ve finally found you.

143
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,810
How are you doing these days?

144
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,020
I went out of the city recently

145
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,260
and didn’t do you any favors.

146
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,740
It doesn’t matter.

147
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,460
I’m fine.

148
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,580
I didn’t get hurt and everything is fine.

149
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,020
That’s good.

150
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,600
Your Highness.

151
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,770
What’s that in your hand?

152
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,410
Well.

153
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,650
It’s the most popular fruit in Chang’an,

154
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,260
cherries.

155
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,850
They were delivered
to Silver City urgently.

156
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,940
Here are the fresh cherries

157
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,770
and the brown sugar honey I made.

158
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,820
Hope they can make you feel sweet.

159
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,500
Now most concubines in the palace

160
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,460
love them.

161
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,260
Have a try.

162
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,620
They make my mouth watering.

163
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,140
Take it.

164
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,170
Try it.

165
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,460
So sweet.

166
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,770
Do you want any honey?

167
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,700
No. It’s sweet enough.

168
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,020
Spare it to yourselves.

169
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,380
But it’s strange

170
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,820
that all the workers in Wuyun Pavilion

171
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,170
are not here today.

172
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,380
Did they run away again

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,170
because of something?

174
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,090
Stop looking for them.

175
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,460
I am the only guest today.

176
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:42,970
What do you mean?

177
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,330
His Highness

178
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,900
booked the whole Wuyun Pavilion.

179
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,700
The girls each got their reward.

180
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,850
They’re playing gaming upstairs now.

181
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
As for the guests,

182
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,330
we gave them some money
and sent them away.

183
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,060
You booked Wuyun Pavilion?

184
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,410
Did Feng know that?

185
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
As long as there was enough money,
she would definitely agree.

186
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,410
Do you know the money you spent

187
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,820
can feed a family of the lower class

188
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,330
for more than a year?

189
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,060
Even if you’re a prince,

190
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,500
you shouldn’t waste money.

191
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,850
Do you know? In our gang,

192
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,970
many people can’t afford

193
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,380
the medicine when they’re sick

194
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,210
and even their landed property
had been taken away.

195
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,700
Miss Long,

196
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,020
His Highness worried about you so much

197
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,900
that he got here the moment
he returned to the city,

198
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,770
But you hadn’t been in for several times.

199
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,140
Therefore,

200
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,090
His Highness

201
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,380
booked the whole Wuyun Pavilion

202
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,650
in order to see you

203
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,940
no matter how late it would be.

204
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,950
You knew nothing about that.

205
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,130
How could you blame him for that?

206
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,580
Sorry.

207
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,410
Well.

208
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,580
We’re brothers. Hope you don’t mind.

209
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,650
It’s alright this time.

210
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,530
But don’t waste money next time.

211
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,170
Say something.

212
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,060
I’m sorry for what I said.

213
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,970
Why are you crying?

214
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,580
I’ve got it wrong.

215
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,410
It isn’t brown sugar honey.
It’s pepper water.

216
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,140
Your Highness!

217
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,090
Pepper water?

218
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,060
Your Highness!

219
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,500
- Water. Water.
- Here. Here is the water.

220
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,170
Are you okay, Your Highness?

221
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,410
= Xinsilu =

222
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,770
Welcome. This way, please.

223
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,850
Welcome.

224
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,410
Welcome. This way, please.

225
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,900
Is it new?

226
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,530
Yes.

227
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,170
Give it to me.

228
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,800
But why do you think it’s for you?

229
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,020
Not for me. Is it…

230
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,930
Here you are.

231
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,770
It’s really wonderful. I’ve just seen it.

232
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,140
Master, Xiaoqin said

233
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,340
Master Long busied herself
in the gang every day

234
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,210
as if she was afraid of being idle.

235
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,380
This is what I just chose.

236
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,590
I know.

237
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,810
- Look at my make-up, is it beautiful?
- I just want to tell you about it.

238
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,600
You…

239
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,560
Go! Go!

240
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,900
Now the girls in our silk store

241
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,060
make people scared.

242
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:12,900
What’s wrong?

243
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,620
In the evening, they use facial cream

244
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,260
that looks like charcoal.

245
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,580
Only their eyes and mouths can be seen.

246
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,140
Last time Xiaowu was scared by them.

247
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,770
Isn’t it just a whitening cream?

248
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,530
Is there anything special?

249
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,770
Do you know?

250
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,330
I heard it was Miss Du

251
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,140
that gave them the cream.

252
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,970
And

253
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,170
every day Miss Du

254
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,460
taught the workers

255
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,650
how to make up.

256
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,580
In order not to stain the silk, Xiaoxian

257
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
has made a rule that

258
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,500
workers are not allowed to make up
when working.

259
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,330
Why did she suddenly change her mind?

260
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,580
Yeah!

261
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Everyone said she changed a lot.

262
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,060
And now she’s just like

263
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,220
Master Long.

264
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,340
Qingliu.

265
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,450
Miss Du.

266
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,070
What kind of soup is it today?

267
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,940
Is that liquor?

268
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,180
Yeah, it’s liquor.

269
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,300
Qingliu.

270
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,890
This is the new-made

271
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,220
Jiannan Spring this year.

272
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,610
Before paying tribute,

273
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,890
I took some from my father.

274
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,010
The Double Seventh Festival is coming.

275
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,630
I can prepare some dishes

276
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
to have a drink with you.

277
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,910
Are you serious?

278
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,510
Miss Du.

279
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,110
I hear you don’t drink at all.

280
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,080
Do you really want to have a drink?

281
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
It would be nice to drink a little.

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,510
Do you think so, Qingliu?

283
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,440
As you wish.

284
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,830
Yan Bin, take the liquor first.

285
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,790
By the way.

286
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,750
Here comes the robe material
that Mr. Wang asked for.

287
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,600
He trusts to your taste most.

288
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,960
Why not check the material together?

289
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,720
Hmm.

290
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,870
The Double Seventh Festival is coming.

291
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,790
However, Master promised to

292
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,840
have a drink with Miss Du.

293
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,360
Then what about Xiaoqin and Master Long?

294
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,670
Manager Yan.

295
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,440
Miss Du, what can I do for you?

296
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,270
I hear that you like storybooks.

297
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
I found some. Here you are.

298
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,030
These, these books are out of print.

299
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,910
These books, for me?

300
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,510
Sure, I found them for you.

301
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
I’m glad you like them.

302
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,080
If you want more in the future,

303
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,390
just tell me.

304
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,440
It’s, it’s so kind of you.

305
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,240
Yue’er, let’s go.

306
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,300
= Goguryeo Honki =

307
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,270
= Liquor =

308
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,910
Boss.

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,030
Yes?

310
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,910
A bottle of liquor.

311
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,840
Alright.

312
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,440
Do you think

313
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,480
whether one bottle is enough
for Miss Long to drink?

314
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,630
What about two bottles?

315
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,080
OK.

316
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,600
No.

317
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,750
The liquor is too strong.

318
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,870
She’d better not drink too much.

319
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,110
Come here.

320
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,390
Here you are.

321
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,000
Unbelievable.

322
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,320
In Silver City, this is a place where

323
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,960
we lower class have a drink.

324
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Why would a big shot like you

325
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,150
come here?

326
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,270
Have a seat, please.

327
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,840
= Liquor =
The boss here invited me to drink.

328
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,080
And when it came to drinking,

329
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,870
I thought of you, Master Long.

330
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Great!

331
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,790
Here it comes!

332
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,080
Liu.

333
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
Here you are, Master Long.

334
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,320
Here.

335
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,960
Liu.

336
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,670
It’s very unkind of you.

337
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,240
What you gave to me last time

338
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,870
were half less than these.

339
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,390
Right, Liu.

340
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,320
You’re so partial.

341
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,120
Master Long, Xiaoqin.

342
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,200
Excuse me, please.

343
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,480
Not long ago, my wife suffered
from miscarriage.

344
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,510
Master Long,

345
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,030
you helped me to look for the medicine.

346
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,030
At last, Prince Zhao knew about it.

347
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,510
He gave me a

348
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,790
red Ganoderma lucidum.

349
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,080
He did me such a big favor.

350
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,030
Let alone these peanuts,

351
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
you can even have them
for free every time.

352
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,750
Ganoderma lucidum?

353
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,550
That’s something

354
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,240
you can’t buy with money.

355
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,790
I see.

356
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,550
I was searching for solutions to

357
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,240
Liu’s problem.

358
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,870
But how did you know about it?

359
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,080
It’s easy to know what you’re busy with.

360
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
Just ask someone in Longzhu Gang.

361
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,390
Master.

362
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,270
Master.

363
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,510
These are something
to show our regard for you.

364
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,550
Yes. Yes.

365
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
You’re…

366
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,320
Prince Zhao is so kind.

367
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,000
He helped my husband

368
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,770
find a job in the government.

369
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,870
He helped us keep the land property

370
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,600
that had been taken away.

371
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Now there are doctors

372
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,150
treating my father’s tuberculosis.

373
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,120
Thank you, Zhao.

374
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Everybody, you’re welcome.

375
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,770
That’s

376
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,700
what I should do.

377
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,940
People’s well-being is

378
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,580
the foundation of the prosperity of Tang.

379
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,060
If you have difficulties in the future,

380
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,850
just ask me for help.

381
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,940
- Thanks, Zhao.
- Thanks, Zhao.

382
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,060
- Prince Zhao is so kind.
- Thanks, Zhao.

383
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,580
- It’s so kind of you.
- So kind of you.

384
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,730
I’ll take these things.

385
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,220
You all have something to do at home.

386
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,220
Please go back home now.

387
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,370
Thanks, Zhao.

388
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,940
- Goodbye, Zhao.
- Goodbye.

389
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,380
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

390
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,730
Well.

391
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,940
I thought you, a person
from the upper class,

392
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,770
made friends with us

393
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,010
just for fun.

394
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,300
Unexpectedly,

395
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,370
you really did something
to help the common people.

396
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Cheers. A toast to you!

397
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,870
For what?

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,960
For my concern about the world
and the people?

399
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
That’s not enough.

400
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,870
It’s the Double Seventh Festival today.

401
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,360
Let me propose a toast to your

402
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
talents and elegance like Yutu.

403
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,000
Yutu?

404
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,790
Cheers!

405
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,750
It’s the Double Seventh Festival today.

406
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,870
Here are new-made sweet wine

407
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,080
and Jiannan Spring. What else
do you want to drink?

408
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,120
It’s on me tonight.

409
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,870
Tonight, I…

410
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,630
What’s wrong?

411
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,750
Do you already have appointments?

412
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
No.

413
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,510
Alright, it’s my treat tonight.

414
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,080
Let’s go back to Wuyun Pavilion.

415
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Under Master’s bed,

416
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,630
there are many bottles of good liquor.

417
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,510
Have an egg.

418
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,150
The Double Seventh Festival

419
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,790
is the most important festival
to our silk industry.

420
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,200
Here comes a calm after a storm
for Xinsilu this year.

421
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,270
We must make a better ceremony
to celebrate it.

422
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,270
So much for today’s ceremony.

423
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,910
It’s the Double Seventh Festival today.

424
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,750
The person who prays most sincerely

425
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,670
with the thickest spinning in the box

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,960
will get the special gift given
by Master Li.

427
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,630
Tonight, you can

428
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,360
celebrate the festival in Silk Store.

429
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,390
But pay attention to the candles.

430
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,880
Wonderful!

431
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,030
Go back now.

432
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,620
- Let’s go.
- Go.

433
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,550
Qingliu,

434
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,270
how about having a tour
on the Jinjiang River?

435
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,670
I booked a boat.

436
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
There is a cook I invited

437
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,360
from Zuixing Lane in Chang’an.

438
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,910
We can have a drink
and appreciate the stars.

439
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,150
Then call Master Long together.

440
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,320
The Double Seventh Festival

441
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,790
is a day for couples
to express their love.

442
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,910
Master Long may already

443
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,440
have an appointment.

444
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,630
I prepared a dress

445
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,270
made from Gaoli Silk for her.

446
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,870
Do you have to send it today?

447
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,320
The cowherd and the weaving maid

448
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,390
are the gods of our industry.

449
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,510
I think it’s proper to

450
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,120
express my gratitude today.

451
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,360
Alright. I’ll go with you.

452
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,170
Sir.

453
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,460
Just stay.

454
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
Of course I miss you.

455
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,500
Come on.

456
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,420
= Wuyun Pavilion =

457
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,170
Don’t run away.

458
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,760
I got you!

459
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,870
Well. Put these two here

460
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,200
and these two there.

461
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,360
You put them too low.

462
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,150
Tonight, people should stand higher
and watch further.

463
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,310
Feng.

464
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,120
Mr. Li.

465
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,240
Long, come out. Mr. Li is here.

466
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Long is so popular

467
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,240
today

468
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,720
that so many excellent young men

469
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,000
came for her.

470
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,550
I can’t even count them.

471
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,910
One after another.

472
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,200
How could he

473
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
come here with a lady?

474
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,200
I wasn’t in the city recently.

475
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,150
I heard you protected her
when she was naked.

476
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,240
Well-played.

477
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,840
What do you mean?

478
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,390
Why are you standing there?

479
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,790
Come in and sit together.

480
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,910
Yes, that’s right.

481
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,670
You can sit together.

482
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,910
I’ll prepare some liquor for you.

483
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,270
It’s so stupid of you.

484
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,310
How could you sit together?

485
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,830
I’m sorry for my offense before.

486
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,480
And this is for you.

487
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,070
It’s the dress
that Qingliu prepared for you.

488
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,160
It’s made from Gaoli Silk.

489
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,480
You can have a try.

490
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,790
You…

491
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,000
To express my gratitude.

492
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,640
Why must you send it today?

493
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,160
Right?

494
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,480
Miss Long, take it.

495
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,070
He adores you.

496
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Right. Right.

497
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,240
Well.

498
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,200
There is an old saying that
we don’t refuse a person sending gifts.

499
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,920
Since Master Li and Miss Du

500
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,000
prepared the gift for me,

501
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,000
I’ll take it then.

502
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,510
Come in and have a drink.

503
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,950
Today Qingliu and I plan to

504
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,480
drink and watch the stars
on Jinjiang River.

505
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,790
Beg for your pardon.

506
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,270
Let’s go.

507
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,360
Young Master.

508
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,030
Wait!

509
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,270
Watch the stars and drink?

510
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,870
It sounds interesting.

511
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,760
Shall we go together?

512
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,480
Master Long, I’m afraid
it’s not convenient.

513
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,520
The boatman and liquor
are only reserved for two people.

514
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,200
Well, forget it.

515
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,960
If you want to drink and watch stars,

516
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,070
we can climb to the roof of the room

517
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,960
to see further and more clearly.

518
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,830
I’m tired of watching stars on the roof.

519
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,070
Today, I think

520
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,440
it’s more interesting to
have a tour by boat.

521
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,680
It’s such a joyful day.

522
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,830
Why not make it happier?

523
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,310
I heard

524
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,000
the night market in Silver City is fun.

525
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,270
Let’s go and have a look.

526
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,000
And you can have a drink another day.

527
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,030
Good.

528
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,440
Qingliu.

529
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,830
I agree with His Highness.

530
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Tell the boatman to cancel it.

531
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,510
And they can still get the money.

532
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,880
Cancel it. Guests come first.

533
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,830
I’ll be in charge today.

534
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,440
Then what are you waiting for?

535
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,790
Xiangyue, take it for me.

536
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,640
Alright.

537
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,750
Thank you.

538
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,830
Have a good time, Miss Long.

539
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,310
- Let’s go.
- Have a good time.

540
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,030
Enjoy yourselves.

= The North Street of Silver City =

544
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,400
Silver City is so magnificent

545
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,310
with thousands of lights on all night.

546
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
It’s said that the Qiqiao night market

547
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,240
in Silver City is of great fun.

548
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,440
It really deserves the reputation.

549
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,030
That’s right.

550
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,270
Silver City is not worse than Chang’an,
right?

551
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,030
Here’re silk threads with seven colors.

552
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,350
It’s fit for you.

553
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,220
Look at it.

554
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,920
This color looks beautiful.

555
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,500
You.

= Longxiang Desserts =

557
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,350
Miss Long, be careful.

558
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,170
Have a nice day.

559
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,160
Master Long, do you know

560
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,030
the origin of Qiqiao?

561
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,200
I’ve seen people do it since I was a kid.

562
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,110
Maybe it’s a custom.

563
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,000
Each custom has its origin.

564
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
There is a poem saying that

565
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,510
silk with seven colors floats in the sky

566
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,400
with the Milky Way embroidered on it.

567
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,750
It tells a story about a woman.

568
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,160
To wait for her husband
who’d gone on a long journey,

569
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,920
she embroidered on the mountain.

570
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,640
But though she had waited for many years,

571
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,680
her husband still didn’t come back.

572
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,400
The woman was desperate

573
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,160
and the silk she embroidered

574
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,590
was turned into rainbows

575
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,310
hanging in the sky.

576
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,480
Why must she wait all the time?

577
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,720
Why didn’t she remarry someone?

578
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,550
So stupid.

579
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,720
What you’re thinking is

580
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,160
always beyond my expectation.

581
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,750
In fact, a lot of things

582
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,350
have their causes.

583
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,510
Men are born to

584
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,350
earn money and fight for life.

585
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,960
While women only need to

586
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,400
accept their position in life

587
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,590
and abide the rules.

588
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,790
Miss Du, what you said

589
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,720
is quite correct.

590
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,160
The most important thing to be a man

591
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,680
is to know his position in life.

592
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,070
To make it more exactly,

593
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,070
we mustn’t go beyond the bounds.

594
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,110
Thank you.

595
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,920
Master Long, do you know?

596
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,110
We come here to play.

597
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,830
Don’t chew upon words any more.

598
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,680
Qingliu, that’s not right.

599
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,680
Words need to be chewed upon.

600
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,790
Or else, there won’t be

601
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,830
Good-looking like Jade and Golden House.

602
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,310
You guys are so boring!

603
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,510
Do you come here to play?

604
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,750
If you go on bickering,

605
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,880
stay away from me.

606
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,420
So beautiful.

607
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,010
Look.

608
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,770
Look at that one.

609
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:55,770
So pretty.

610
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,400
Master Long.

611
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,870
Look at that one.

612
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,030
Is this what you said

613
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,720
Thousands of Lanterns Show?

614
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,330
So beautiful.

615
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,380
- Yes.
- So beautiful.

616
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,550
Look! These lights are
bright and beautiful.

617
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,550
Actually,

618
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,400
Chang’an has the similar lantern show.

619
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,350
Colorful lanterns are everywhere
and brightness can be seen from faraway.

620
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,070
It’s interesting and pretty.

621
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,680
It seems that you like poems very much.

622
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,550
Later,

623
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,750
there will be a poem competition.

624
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,400
Would you like to try it
and win some prizes?

625
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,920
Alright. That’s great.

626
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,410
What about having a look around the front?

627
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,200
- Sure.
- Good idea.

628
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,410
Go.

629
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,130
Distinguished guests,

630
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,680
Look at this one.

631
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,350
The best lantern in the lantern show today

632
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,790
is a green lotus one.

633
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,640
But it’s not that ordinary.

634
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
There are poems

635
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,480
written by Minister Li on it.

636
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,880
When minister took a boat and
watch lanterns, his sorrow disappeared.

637
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,480
Since it’s the Double Seventh Festival,

638
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,510
So

639
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,400
the poems you make today

640
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,830
must be related with Love.

641
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Love.

642
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,030
How many poems on this topic
do you remember?

643
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,000
Qingliu, do you remember

644
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
what Mr. Fang of Jintan Shop likes most?

645
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,950
The poems written by Minister Li.

646
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,850
I don’t remember any.

647
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,960
This time, he helped us

648
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,480
get many big orders.

649
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,270
It will be his birthday soon.

650
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,750
How about sending him the lantern?

651
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,240
OK.

652
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,140
Think harder.

653
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,120
Think harder.

654
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,180
He…

655
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,240
Aren’t you Mr. Li from Xinsilu?

656
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,350
So glad to meet you.

657
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,350
It’s a great honor to have Mr. Li

658
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,830
to attend our lantern show.

659
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,450
Exactly.

660
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:23,980
That’s Mr. Li.

661
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,160
- Yes.
- It’s Mr. Li.

662
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,240
Yes.

663
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,440
This green lotus lantern

664
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,920
is the best one this year.

665
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,510
Qingliu knows that I need it

666
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,790
and tries to get it for me.

667
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,480
Is there anyone who wants to

668
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,160
compete with Mr. Li?

669
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,160
Stay here.

670
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,750
I’ll win the lantern for you.

671
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,640
I think when I take showers,

672
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,830
I need a lantern

673
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,400
that’s bright and beautiful.

674
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,000
But it’s my own business, Your Highness.

675
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I’ll get it myself.

676
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,560
Someone gets on the stage.

677
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,720
Who is that?

678
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,550
Is it Master Long?

679
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,590
Will you

680
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,200
compete with Mr. Li again?

681
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,750
Master Li.

682
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,350
What are you doing here?

683
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,880
It was just to make some poems about love.

684
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
I can handle it.

685
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,830
Just have a look.

686
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
You’ll know what a head-on blow is.

687
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,920
Waiting for her lover wholeheartedly,
she will never forget their past.

688
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,350
What the hell?

689
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,830
What is that?

690
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,160
How dare she make it on stage?

691
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,720
Shame on you!

692
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,350
I watch pear blossom under the moon,

693
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,480
not knowing who is awake at night.

694
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,480
Excellent! Excellent!

695
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,070
He just used more words than me.

696
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,110
Mr. Li won.

697
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,510
Well.

698
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,480
Love makes me heartbroken
so I open the door to wait for my lover.

699
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,680
It’s so vulgar of the girl to

700
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,880
say “love” and “lover”.

701
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,640
Regardless of what I said,

702
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,400
I matched them on.

703
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,680
Right? I matched them on.

704
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:01,950
Darn it.

705
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,240
Our emotions are always infatuated.

706
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,590
It has less to do with wind and moon.

707
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,030
Brilliant.

708
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,390
Mr. Li won again.

709
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,350
The room…

710
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,510
The room is warm at midnight in fall.

711
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,590
My lover does the make-up for me.

712
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,990
She used “lover” again.

713
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,630
The poems she made are so unbearable

714
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,740
that my ear hurts.

715
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,210
I feel ashamed of her.

716
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,190
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

717
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,980
These vulgar poems

718
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,440
are made to flatter the men

719
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,940
in the brothels.

720
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,880
Your turn.

721
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,200
Stop!

722
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,480
There is no need to expose
your weakness to the public.

723
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,510
You are talented

724
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,550
while I am ignorant.

725
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,400
You look down on me.

726
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,160
Well.

727
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,030
When lights are on at night
and sun rises at dawn,

728
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,030
it’s the time to read.

729
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,920
How could he make such a mistake?

730
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,440
Agree.

731
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,070
He made it on purpose.

732
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,310
Mr. Li, it’s not about love.

733
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,880
I lose this time.

734
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,000
What’s more, I quit.

735
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
The green lotus lantern

736
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,030
- belongs to Master Long.
- Why?

737
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,830
What’s your point?

738
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,400
You wanted to win and you win.

739
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,110
I wanted to win?

740
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,960
It’s you who wanted to

741
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,590
win the green lotus lantern

742
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,200
for Miss Du.

743
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,720
She is waiting for you off the stage.

744
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,480
Why do you give up now?

745
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,200
Are you

746
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
feeling sorry for me as I was laughed at?

747
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,720
Or are you looking down on me

748
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,240
because I was illiterate and ignorant.

749
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,880
You’re mistaken about me.

750
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,480
The Double Seventh Festival

751
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,640
and the poems are totally bullshit.

752
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,030
They’re like firecrackers in the mouth.

753
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,440
Back off! Back off!

754
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,580
She is so rude.

755
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,510
Winning the game, she shall get mad.

756
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,160
Miss Long.

757
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,790
Altair is so far away and the maid
is waiting on the side of the Milky Way.

758
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,270
Qingliu,

759
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,750
do you remember the moment

760
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,270
on the same road last year?

761
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,270
Altair is so far away and the maid
is waiting on the side of the Milky Way.

762
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,110
Loom is working
with her slender hands operating.

763
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,640
There’re so many businesses recently.

764
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,830
We haven’t been out together
for a long time.

765
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,440
There’s a lantern show in Yongping Lane.

766
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,000
But I guess

767
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,270
you don’t like the noise there.

768
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,000
Reciting poems should be elegant.

769
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,830
But they make it a farce every year

770
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,110
with gambling and lantern riddles.

771
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,640
The atmosphere is foul.

772
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,350
Beauties,

773
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,200
where are you going?

774
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,440
What do you want?

775
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,920
This lady is so beautiful.

776
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,830
Don’t touch her!

777
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,550
Or I’ll kill you.

778
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,750
You’d better go away.

779
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,790
Don’t worry. I’m here with you.

780
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,830
Till now,

781
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,270
I still remember what happened then.

782
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,880
Of course, I remember it.

783
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:34,790
Xiaoxian.

784
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,200
It’s getting late.

785
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,880
I’ll send you back first,

786
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,000
Let’s go.

787
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,960
Qingliu,

788
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,000
I’m in your heart, right?

789
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,960
One year when we went to Jiangnan
to buy cloth materials

790
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,350
and ran into robbers,

791
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,790
you protected me

792
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,000
regardless of your own safety.

793
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,240
You care about me, right?

794
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,880
We’ve known each other for so long.

795
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,000
When we’re away from home,

796
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,350
it’s my duty to

797
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
keep you safe and sound.

798
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,790
It’s too late.

799
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,160
Let’s go.

800
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,580
= Wuyun Pavilion =
Come and play for a moment.

801
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,720
- Beauty.
- Come. Come here.

802
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,350
The young shoots of reeds are grey.
The white dew looks like frost.

803
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,310
The girl I miss is at the other side
of the river.

804
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:51,790
Miss!

805
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,350
Things on Feng’s list

806
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,510
will be ready tomorrow.

807
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,790
I go up the stream in quest of her.
But the way is…

808
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,920
Miss, are you okay?

809
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,790
But the way is…

810
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,960
I’m not good at it.

811
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,510
But the way is difficult and long.

812
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,340
I go down the stream in quest of her.
She is right in the midst of the water.

813
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
A great poem.

814
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,450
It’s a great poem.

815
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,100
Master, gold thread clothes are ready.

816
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,620
The Persian traders came
to pick up the goods.

817
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,500
Master Li.

818
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,010
Thank you, Master Li.

819
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,170
What’s more,

820
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,920
your wife is beautiful and wise.

821
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,240
I’m not his wife.

822
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,780
Not now.

823
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,300
But you will be sooner or later.

824
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,850
This is benzoin from Persia

825
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,740
for this beautiful lady.

826
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,450
I’m looking forward to your wedding feast.

827
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,930
Good cooperation.

828
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,580
It’s said that

829
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,580
when Emperor Gaozu was

830
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,340
to rise in arms,

831
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,300
something happened in his family.

832
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,930
His daughter, Princess Pingyang Zhao

833
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,100
and her husband were

834
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,170
trapped in Chang’an by Sui Army.

835
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,020
She was eager to get out
and find her father.

836
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,170
What did she do?

837
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,340
It was urgent.

838
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,370
- Master, look at him.
- At a critical moment.

839
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,130
Gengzi is making mystical nonsense again.

840
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,580
We are all waiting.

841
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,580
- Just listen carefully.
- There’s an old saying.

842
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,100
The book has been read many times.

843
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,020
It must be a good story.

844
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,450
But Princess Pingyang Zhao

845
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,130
didn’t pack up

846
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,850
or run away with her husband.

847
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,260
They were separated.

848
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,370
Gengzi.

849
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,100
Come on.

850
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,410
There are a lot of things
to do in the gang.

851
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,450
We all need to report what we learn.

852
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,650
Don’t take up all the time.

853
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,340
Right!

854
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,370
Well.

855
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,610
What are you arguing about?

856
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,300
Take Gengzi as an example.

857
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,340
He can tell such a good story.

858
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,380
I ask you to read books
and learn something.

859
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,490
Have you read it?

860
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,780
Go, go, go.

861
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,450
Master.

862
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,300
We made a rule
that everyone reads a few lines.

863
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,820
Gengzi didn’t follow the rule.

864
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,170
When shall I report

865
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,540
Biographies of Women to you?

866
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,250
Biographies of Women? Forget it.

867
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,100
Men wrote it to tell women to

868
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,860
become stupid till death.

869
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,970
I don’t want to listen to it.

870
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,540
Go on, Gengzi.

871
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,820
However, Princess Pingyang Zhao

872
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,930
is not an ordinary woman.

873
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,730
She was

874
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,100
very ambitious.

875
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,410
She defeated Sui Army and

876
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,830
they were so scared and escaped.

877
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,970
Great!

878
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,520
Great!

879
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,300
What are you doing here?

880
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,540
I came to bring them to you.

881
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,170
Uh... Well...

882
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,900
Plant them in the field in spring

883
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,820
to see the harvest.

884
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,410
It’s called Ayue Hunzi

885
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,380
from the Western Regions.

886
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,010
Try it.

887
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,450
Something to eat? Great.

888
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,740
As soon as I do business,
you’ll disturb me.

889
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,260
Don’t you think Princess Pingyang Zhao

890
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,820
Hey, bro!

891
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,260
- is really a heroine
- Have you ever heard about it?

892
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,900
- who deserves our admiration?
- What?

893
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:45,900
Admiration?

894
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,090
It was the scum men that

895
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,900
forced women to rush in the front.

896
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,020
Well. Do you know it?

897
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,500
This.

898
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,290
What?

899
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,050
Why are you laughing? Tell us about it.

900
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:06,970
Fatty.

901
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,300
Why are you laughing?

902
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,090
Tell us.

903
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,740
I’m laughing because I heard a story

904
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,260
similar to Niangziguan

905
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,090
on the street.

906
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,300
Niangziguan? What’s that?

907
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,220
It’s the most popular story now.

908
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,640
It says that Li Qingliu and you were

909
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,700
trapped in the water chamber.

910
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,450
It was so hot that you took off
all your clothes.

911
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,300
Shut up!

912
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,260
Who

913
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,530
spread the gossip on the street?

914
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,090
Xiaoqin, let’s go.

915
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,050
Master.

916
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,770
On the morning of that day,

917
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,580
I was about to build a fire in the kiln

918
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,060
when I heard sounds of banging
on the wall.

919
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,730
The sounds of banging?

920
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,770
I was very afraid.

921
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,100
It was in the early morning,

922
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,940
= Book-telling Field =
No one would come to the kiln.

923
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,100
I thought there were ghosts first.

924
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,060
Later, the sound was clear.

925
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,020
It was someone

926
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
hitting the wall in the water chamber.

927
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,480
Who?

928
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,460
Well, I opened the door.

929
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,730
Guess what?

930
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,100
What?

931
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,170
Master Long came out first

932
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,090
with her hair and clothes scattered.

933
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,520
Really?

934
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,900
And then?

935
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,060
- Go on.
- Go on.

936
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,610
Master Long.

937
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,770
Master Long.

938
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,810
What was going on?

939
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,330
- What was going on?
- Go ahead.

940
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,100
And then?

941
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,810
Come on then.

942
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,730
Go ahead.

943
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,380
Just go ahead.

944
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,770
Why don’t you talk anymore?

945
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,290
Just go on.

946
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:35,610
Go on.

947
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,810
Master Long

948
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,290
was bright and brave.

949
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,730
Although she was trapped
in the water chamber,

950
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,580
she was still strong-minded and powerful.

951
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,300
She pulled Li Qingliu with one hand

952
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,940
and lifted him up.

953
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,380
I was about to help

954
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,460
when Master Long

955
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,690
was yelling at me

956
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,690
to back off.

957
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,020
You changed the story again.

958
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,770
Hu Laosan.

959
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,330
You can’t change it three times a day.

960
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,580
We came here

961
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,130
because you told us

962
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,290
those two masters were

963
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,580
madly in love in the water chamber.

964
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,580
Right.

965
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,690
- Were you there or not?
- Well.

966
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,380
Were you there or not?

967
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,730
Don’t fool us with the story of Mulan.

968
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,690
- Have you seen anything or not?
- Right.

969
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,580
And…

970
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:16,900
What are you talking about?

971
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,810
Did they really hug each other naked

972
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,770
and have a relationship?

973
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,500
- That one. That one.
- We want to hear the story that

974
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,810
Master Long

975
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,770
flattered the master of Xinsilu

976
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,330
when he fell into coma.

977
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,290
Then what happened next?

978
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:29,980
Right. What happened next?

979
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,060
That is the best part of the story.

980
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
Come on.

981
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,690
Just go ahead.

982
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,330
Come on.

983
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
Just go ahead.

984
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,520
Go on.

985
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,700
- Just go ahead.
- Go on.

986
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,690
Just go ahead.

987
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,380
Go ahead.

988
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,380
Forgive me, Master Long.

989
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,500
- You don’t want to live anymore, right?
- Master Long.

990
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,810
It hurts!

991
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,100
