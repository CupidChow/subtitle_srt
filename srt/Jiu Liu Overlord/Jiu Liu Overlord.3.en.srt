32
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,560
Master Long.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Come on, calm down, please.

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,610
Here.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,470
Nobody expected such a disrupter

36
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,680
half way through.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,150
But just take it easy.

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,190
The surplus money of your bid price

39
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,560
will be sent to you tonight.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,430
Great!

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,430
I can get hundreds of rare articles
for my master then.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,590
Master Long.

43
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,310
I’m leaving then.

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,000
Master Long.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,680
She said her son Dachun was
a member of your gang

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,190
and had been lost for days.

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,310
The whole family depends on her son
for daily bread.

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,150
She hopes you can help her find him.

49
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,680
Dachun was missing?

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,750
Don’t worry, Madam.

51
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,680
When did you see him last time?

52
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,910
Mother, I am full.

53
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,470
Come on.

54
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,520
Let’s go, Dachun!

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Mother, I will go out with them.

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Don’t worry.

57
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,870
I will be back soon.

58
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
Don’t worry, Madam.

59
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,520
I will dispatch my men

60
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,430
in search of your son right away.

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,470
Thanks, Master Long.

62
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,960
Thanks, Master Long.

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,310
You’re welcome.

64
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,190
Go.

65
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,360
I encountered Wu, the tomb robber,

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,000
before the auction.

67
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,030
He said he saw Dachun at the door

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,870
before entering the city for peddling.

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,080
He had disappeared

70
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,310
before Wu greeted him.

71
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,190
Why didn’t you say it earlier?

72
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,870
I …

73
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,080
Will you have admitted it
if I had told you earlier?

74
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,630
Is this the rare stuff?

75
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,960
It is just a horsetail whisk.

76
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,800
Good luck indeed.

77
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Or I would have wasted a lot of money.

78
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,560
5,000 taels?

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
10,000.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
It is 10,000 taels.

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,000
10,000 taels would have been wasted.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,830
Did you replace the gold threads with

83
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,120
the horsetail whisk by pretending

84
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,830
to offer a bid onstage just now?

85
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,630
I didn’t expect

86
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,830
the thieves of Longzhu Gang

87
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,560
were so despicable.

88
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,240
Where are my gold threads?

89
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,430
Thief?

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,750
Watch your words!

91
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,920
And watch your hands.

92
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,120
Gold threads?

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,270
As my master put it,

94
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,270
you are already enchanted

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,680
and take everything as gold threads.

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,800
Forget it.

97
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,870
Just take it as a lesson.

98
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,680
Return the money,

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,800
or you can’t leave here.

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,430
Don’t block my way.

101
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,830
I have no time to blabber with you.

102
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,510
Go away!

103
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,750
Long Aoyi.

104
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,920
I have concrete evidence.
You can’t deny it.

105
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,750
This is what I found on the site
where gold threats were lost.

106
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,190
This is a uniform of our gang.

107
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,070
What’s wrong?

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,040
Do you expect to join our gang?

109
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,870
The evidence is here.

110
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,160
You can’t deny it.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,870
Yes.

112
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,360
Yes.

113
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,950
How can a young girl become

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,630
the master of Longzhu Gang?

115
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,270
- The fact is that
- Yeah.

116
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,750
It is all because of frauds and lies.

117
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,630
Right?

118
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,600
Exactly.

119
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,720
Shut up!

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,870
Don’t slander our gang

121
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,720
in such despicable ways.

122
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,480
Or I will kick your ass.

123
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,270
Listen again.

124
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,070
Our gang never engages
in stealing, fraud and gambling.

125
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,510
Any violator will receive

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
the punishment of broken limbs.

127
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
It is said they played a trick

128
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,120
by breaking the bowl

129
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
to defeat Snake Gang at Wanhua.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,950
Such a despicable means of stealing isn’t

131
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,800
what a gang master is supposed to do.

132
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,070
It is hard to gain the respect that way.

133
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,360
Do you agree with me?

134
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,390
- Yes.
- Exactly.

135
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,270
Nonsense!

136
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,560
Return me the gold threads.

137
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,750
Yes, there is concrete evidence.

138
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,360
- Yes.
- Give back to him.

139
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,390
Just give back.

140
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,600
Yes, just give back to him.

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,190
Give back.

142
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,870
- Return my gold threads now.
- Give back to him.

143
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,190
Stop it!

144
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,950
Dachun,

145
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,360
Master!

146
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,600
Don’t run away.

147
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,680
Don’t go away.

148
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,600
Don’t run away.

149
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,950
Wu Lin, what’s up?

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,390
Look, Your Highness.

151
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,750
Pepper!

152
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,190
Yes.

Wu Lin.

154
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,870
Make a secret search.

155
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,120
Is the auction over?

156
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,190
The last commodity was already sold.

157
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,000
They are coming out.

158
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,390
Let me go!

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
What are you doing, dude?

160
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,800
Let me go!

161
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,830
= Clothes Shop =

162
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,870
Help!

163
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,600
Somebody!

164
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,310
Help me!

165
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,560
Stop!

166
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,600
Why did you beat him?

167
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,560
Let me down!

168
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,430
Your Highness!

169
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,830
Be careful.

170
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,120
Don’t you know how to take care of a girl?

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,630
Stop!

172
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,750
Sir.

173
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,480
I am afraid you have caught
the wrong person.

174
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,750
She is the female thief.

175
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,440
The wrong person indeed.

176
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,000
This is the thief

177
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,670
who robs a civilian girl publicly.

178
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,600
Shut up!

179
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,120
It is up to the official

180
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,550
to make a judgment.

181
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,870
Sir.

182
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,200
Keep a close eye on them!

183
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,550
Aren’t they the two ones in Silver City…

184
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,600
They are felons.

185
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Lock them up in a room

186
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,550
and wait for a trial tomorrow.

187
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,320
Yes.

188
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,510
- One room?
- One room?

189
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,120
It’s too late to regret now.

190
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,000
This is the sixth son of His Majesty,

191
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,000
Prince Zhao of the Tang Dynasty.

192
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,270
How dare you offend him!

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,600
Lock them up!

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
Who is that?

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,030
Watch them carefully!

196
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,080
- Prince!
- Prince!

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,440
Hello?

198
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,060
= Xinsilu =

199
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,630
Yan Bin.

200
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,200
Miss Du.

201
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Where are you going?

202
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,510
Where is your master?

203
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,390
Well.

204
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,000
Master was put in prison by Mr. Du.

205
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,750
What?

206
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,910
I must rush over there right away.

207
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,960
Father.

208
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,750
Where are you going, Xiaoxian?

209
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,240
Aren’t you accompanying Prince Zhao

210
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,550
and showing him around Silver City?

211
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,320
Li Qingliu, he…

212
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,270
Li Qingliu.

213
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,630
Li Qingliu and Long Aoyi

214
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,360
wounded Her Highness at the
black market of Southern City.

215
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,440
Long Aoyi…

216
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,600
Xiaoxian.

217
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,600
Don’t you know the powers of Concubine De
in the palace now?

218
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,200
Instead of getting well along

219
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,910
with him, you had him wounded

220
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,960
during the trip in Silver City.

221
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,480
If the central government
traces the responsibility,

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
we will certainly be punished.

223
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
Now

224
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
everybody in Silver City knows that
I am a prince.

225
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,840
How can I go there later?

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,270
I beg your pardon, Your Highness.
The situation was out of control and

227
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,440
I had to report to the commissioner.

228
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,030
Go.

229
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,390
As ordered by Mr. Du,
His Highness is sick now.

230
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,720
Please have a rest.

231
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,960
Who is sick?

232
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,630
The doctor diagnosed just now.

233
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
I am in a good condition.

234
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,720
I beg your pardon, Your Highness!

235
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,510
I am just following the order.

236
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,630
Look.

237
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,360
How bold is Du Changfeng.

238
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,000
How dare he place me under house arrest!

239
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,150
Call him here right away.

240
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,790
Yes.

241
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,270
The female hooligan of Longzhu Gang

242
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,440
destroyed my gold-thread clothes
at Wanhua that day.

243
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,720
Father, Yan Bin told me

244
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,630
gold threads was stolen by her men.

245
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,150
The incident took place just for it.

246
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,510
Father, please check it clearly.

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,630
Xiaoxian,

248
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
I take Li Qingliu as my adopted son.

249
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,150
He is also a big figure in Silver City.

250
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
I naturally won’t blame him.

251
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,600
But Concubine De was already startled

252
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,030
by the injury of His Highness.

253
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,600
Li Qingliu certainly can’t

254
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,320
avoid imprisonment this time.

255
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,130
Father!

256
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,080
Okay.

257
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,200
I will beg Her Highness’s pardon.

258
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,440
- But …
- Mr. Du.

259
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
Mr. Du, you are wanted by His Highness.

260
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,630
I will be right there.

261
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,550
Yes.

262
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,730
Xiaoxian,

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,240
things won’t improve these days.

264
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,670
Promise me

265
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,320
to accompany His Highness

266
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,120
and demonstrate our official attitude

267
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,630
as a token of apology for negligence.

268
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,550
The gold threads…

269
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,550
Are you still worrying about Miss Long,
Your Highness?

270
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,320
Help!

271
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,080
Somebody! Help me!

272
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,240
Lovely.

273
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,510
Your Highness!

274
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,910
Your Highness!

275
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,960
Mr. Du, you have come just in time.

276
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,510
I am fine.

277
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,720
Why don’t you let me go?

278
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,550
Moreover, it is said

279
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,750
you kept two people in custody for it.

280
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,910
Release them right away.

281
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,200
I beg your pardon, Your Highness!

282
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,120
I did it

283
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,120
at the order of Her Highness.

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,030
Before making sure you are well,

285
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,630
I must keep the offender in custody

286
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,510
and wait for further punishment.

287
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,480
Mother?

288
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,150
I started the emergency dispatch

289
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,390
to deliver the news about your injury

290
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,600
back to Chang’an.

291
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,870
You are a member of the royal family.

292
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,360
Her Highness will certainly dispatch
the imperial doctor here after knowing it.

293
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,480
Let’s make a decision after the doctor

294
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,670
makes a detailed diagnosis of you.

295
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,840
= Prison =

296
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,510
Master Long.

297
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,670
You really did a good job for

298
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,000
all silkworm farmers of Silver City.

299
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,740
Yes.

300
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
You really did a good job for us.

301
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,220
Yes.

302
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,510
You have no idea.

303
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,790
Some days ago,

304
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,320
my uncle, aunty and cousin

305
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,030
wanted to commit suicide

306
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,480
because Snake Gang

307
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,870
cut the price of silkworms by 70%.

308
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,840
Just imagine silk and garlic

309
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,080
having the same sales price!

310
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,320
- Yes, yes.
- Exactly.

311
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,550
Things are finally back to normal now.

312
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,960
The price of silkworms is back to normal.

313
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,550
February 2

314
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,550
is really a good day.

315
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,510
It is my duty.

316
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,790
Longzhu Gang is obligated

317
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,840
to serve our folks.

318
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,320
Thanks, Master.

319
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,650
Thanks, Master.

320
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,550
Why are you here this time, Master?

321
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,320
Who is that?

322
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,550
Why are you here with such kind of people?

323
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,000
Such kind of people?

324
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,390
Everybody.

325
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,150
He is head of the most profitable
clothes and silk stores in the upper class

326
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,870
of Silver City today.

327
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,750
Li Qingliu, master of Xinsilu Silk Store.

328
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
Half of the silk of Silver City

329
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,360
must be cashed finally

330
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,000
at the stores of Master Li.

331
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,150
It is him.

332
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,810
Oh.

333
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,720
Unfortunately,

334
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,630
his fortune is useless here.

335
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,480
Does he have gold teeth in mouth

336
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,440
and gold sheets on face?

337
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,000
Let me check it carefully.

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Check carefully!

339
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,840
I don’t know if he has gold teeth or not.

340
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,720
But listen.

341
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,750
You must bite the right place
even if you have gold teeth.

342
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,630
It is really ridiculous for Master Li

343
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,080
to conclude Longzhu Gang has stolen

344
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
his gold threads based on a piece of rag.

345
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,080
What is even more ridiculous is that

346
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,480
this guy has followed me closely

347
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,870
these days, like a piece of sticker.

348
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
He even caused me to be put in prison.

349
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,200
If you hadn’t run away,

350
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,910
I wouldn’t have chased you.

351
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,910
Forget it. Somebody will come

352
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,750
to pick me up in less than half an hour.

353
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,390
As for you…

354
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,320
We will have a conclusion soon

355
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,150
if you have stolen it or not.

356
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,910
Don’t worry, Master Long.

357
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,870
We are backing you here.

358
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,040
Yes, we are backing you.

359
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,550
I am not worried.

360
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,510
I have done nothing wrong.

361
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,360
After the truth is known,

362
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I will claim from those defaming me

363
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,910
and you must apologize to me publicly.

364
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,440
What are you doing?

365
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,360
Listen, don’t touch me.

366
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,960
Shit!

367
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,550
What are you doing?

368
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,720
Take the wheat straw as a dividing line.

369
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,630
We will share this place.

370
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,150
Neither should cross the line.

371
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,080
What?

372
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,910
Nothing.

373
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,320
I just don’t want to stay with a thief.

374
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,600
What are you talking about?

375
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,790
No problem.

376
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,790
Either of us who is found to advance

377
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,600
must surrender the same size of space.

378
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
I agree.

379
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,960
A full pack of rubbishes!

380
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,030
Just calm down, Master Qiyan.

381
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,360
I have good news for you.

382
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,600
Go ahead.

383
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,390
Li Qingliu and Long Aoyi are in prison.

384
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,110
Li Qingliu arrested a thief publicly
at the black market.

385
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,030
We claimed for your wrongs.

386
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,110
Look,

387
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,880
it’s known across the whole city now.

388
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,310
Long Aoyi.

389
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,750
I already told you that
your leadership wouldn’t last long.

390
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,240
= Lofty Integrity =
Your good days are coming to an end.

391
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,790
Take it easy, Master Qiyan.

392
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,030
The pattern of that fabric
is incomplete and blurred.

393
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,720
If Long Aoyi knows we framed her up,

394
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,590
she will definitely come to us for troubles

395
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,510
some days later after her release.

396
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,350
Shut up!

397
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,590
You only spoil things up.

398
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,000
Always

399
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
keep it

400
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
strictly confidential.

401
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Don’t worry, Master Qiyan.

402
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,240
I had arrived before

403
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,510
their master arrived.

404
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,640
Our master has come personally

405
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,070
to confirm something with you.

406
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,640
Please check this fabric carefully.

407
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,830
You two guys have done a good job.

408
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,400
You don’t have to
sell peppers at the black market.

409
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,200
Just be my aides.

410
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Sir, make an arrangement.

411
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,480
Yes.

412
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,680
Long Aoyi.

413
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,110
Sir, may I go in?

414
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,960
= Prison =
Who has admitted you here?

415
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,270
= Prison =
Our master is in there.

416
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,510
I am coming to visit her.

417
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,440
Your master is in there?

418
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,110
Mr. Yan, I want to use the toilet.

419
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,030
Okay.

420
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,310
But our master is in there.

421
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,590
I just want to say hello to…

422
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,720
Aren’t you the servant girl of Master Long?

423
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,510
What’s up? You aren’t admitted?

424
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,070
Just beg me. I can help you.

425
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Mr. Zhu,

426
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,240
I know

427
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,680
you have been very angry about it.

428
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,830
As you know,

429
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
our master isn’t to blame for it.

430
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,030
He…

431
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,110
I am in a dilemma indeed.

432
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,680
Your favor is kindly needed,

433
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,240
okay?

434
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,980
= Prison =

435
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,680
Let’s go.

436
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,790
You owe me this time.

437
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
Steamed bread, steamed bread.

438
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,720
Steamed bread.

439
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,060
Hushed!

440
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,200
What are you doing?

441
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,510
Stop.

442
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,030
What do you mean?

443
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,720
This is the jail of the government.

444
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Please show some respects.

445
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,240
What are you doing?

446
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,030
What do you mean?

447
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,590
It was still half-half just now.

448
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
- Yes. Yes.
- Exactly.

449
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,030
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

450
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,550
You promised to back by two steps
for each step forward just now.

451
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,510
I am already tolerant enough.

452
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,590
If I weren’t kept in custody here,

453
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,510
you would have no space now.

454
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,920
Master!

455
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,350
Master!

456
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,000
Li Qingliu, you are wanted by Mr. Zhu.

457
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,400
Master, are you okay?

458
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,350
Wait for me here.

459
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,830
Master, sorry for it.

460
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,510
Let me check. Are you okay?

461
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,160
What food have you brought here?

462
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,200
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

463
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,270
You are welcome, Master Li. Sit down.

464
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,030
Take a seat.

465
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,720
You are the most influential merchant

466
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,270
of Silver City

467
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,680
and a good aide of Mr. Du.

468
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,340
It is great honor for me to offer a hand.

469
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,940
I have made many mistakes this time.

470
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,260
I hope you won’t mind it.

471
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,780
What else must I do before release?

472
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,140
I will make arrangements for it.

473
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,460
You don’t have to.

474
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,660
His Highness got injured this time.

475
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,820
What matters is not the damage
to the reputation of Silver City’s market

476
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,100
but that the government has known it.

477
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,620
Mr. Du has been busy

478
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,340
with it these two days.

479
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,580
I hope the crisis can be settled soon.

480
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,980
I should be punished for erroneous injury
of High Highness at the black market.

481
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,300
But frankly…

482
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,060
Don’t worry, Master Li.

483
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,740
His Highness has come to Silver City

484
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,620
to supervise the salt and iron business.

485
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,660
But you happened to injure him.

486
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,980
Mr. Zhu.

487
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,860
Just get straight to the point.

488
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,940
I recommend

489
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,700
you avail this opportunity to hand over

490
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,300
the Customs Seal of silk market

491
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,980
to the government.

492
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,900
Have you found Dachun?

493
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,500
It was too crowded

494
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,700
and he got away.

495
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,460
But Second Master’s already determined

496
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,300
the fabric belonged to Dachun.

497
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,140
I have inquired our men.

498
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,860
They said

499
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
the gold threads of Xinsilu were lost

500
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,220
at the same time as Dachun’s missing.

501
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,900
Really?

502
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,340
It seems that guy didn’t tell a lie.

503
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,420
Moreover.

504
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,940
At the black market of big bazar that day,

505
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,220
two people knew Dachun was going out
to deliver goods.

506
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,940
Where are the goods then?

507
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,020
Nobody knows.

508
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,780
But Dachun told the two people that

509
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,020
it was a rare article.

510
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,300
To you,

511
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,460
you can pull yourself out of the quagmire

512
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,740
and prove your innocence.

513
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,890
To the government,

514
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,580
we can diversify the market channels.

515
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,620
I agree with you, Mr. Zhu.

516
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,220
Okay.

517
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,100
But my trading date

518
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,860
with the Persian merchant

519
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,580
on gold-thread clothes is coming.

520
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,700
I need to escort

521
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,580
the delivery personally then.

522
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,900
If the rules are violated and

523
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,940
the Fabric Bureau traces responsibility,

524
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,140
both you and I have to take the blame.

525
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,620
But it is said

526
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,520
the case of loss of Xinsilu’s gold threads

527
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,510
can hardly be cracked.

528
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,580
We already have clues of the gold threads.

529
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,500
The production of gold-thread clothes
will resume soon.

530
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,140
You don’t have to worry, Mr. Zhu.

531
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,060
What really matters now is that

532
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,340
my imprisonment may delay the progress

533
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,700
of gold-thread clothes production

534
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,620
and thus affect the bilateral relations

535
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,260
between the Tang Dynasty and Persia.

536
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,500
I am afraid not only the Fabric Bureau

537
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,620
but the central government
will trace the responsibility then.

538
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,900
Master,

539
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,180
if it was really done by Dachun,

540
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,940
what should we do then?

541
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,420
Don’t make a reckless conclusion now.

542
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
But the rumor says…

543
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,340
What is the rumor?

544
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
It says

545
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,740
you have managed the gang improperly

546
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,580
and engaged in
fraudulent gambling and theft.

547
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,100
Master.

548
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,180
A little gall spoils a great deal of honey.

549
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,940
Master,

550
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,980
you have never undergone such hardships.

551
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,300
When can we leave here?

552
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,220
Ouch!

553
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,700
Yes.

554
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,190
Master, are you starving?

555
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,700
Eat something, eat something.

556
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,220
Master,

557
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,580
I have brought your favorite food.

558
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,780
Vinegar noodles
with bolete and seafood soup,

559
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,100
Yak beef baked with cumin,

560
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,140
acid and hot crab egg cake,

561
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,820
apple jam with quail eggs,

562
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,300
top-grade yak neck beef of Tubo,

563
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,780
splashed with apple juices

564
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,090
of Qi and Lu States and

565
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,380
baked for the burning time of an incense.

566
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,940
The beefs are moderately soft
and tenaciously tender, so yummy.

567
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,140
Go away.

568
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,860
You are not qualified

569
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,060
for our master’s dishes at all.

570
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,180
Master,

571
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,540
this is your favorite

572
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,260
black truffle

573
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,380
and juiced Liaodong sea cucumbers.

574
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,940
Liaodong sea cucumbers
mixed with black truffle juices

575
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,620
Just help yourself.

576
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,180
Ugly girl.

577
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,300
I took you here in kindness
and you stole my dishes.

578
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,140
Ugly? Why do you gaze at an ugly girl?

579
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,910
I…

580
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,090
I didn’t!

581
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,340
Birds of the same feather flock together.

582
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,180
Don’t make a fuss.

583
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
Finish the meal and leave right away.

584
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,780
It is said Dachun is a filial boy.

585
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,060
He will go back to see his mother soon.

586
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,980
Keep an eye on his home.

587
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Everything will be clear
after Dachun is found.

588
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,660
Okay.

589
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,180
Has Xiaoxian got any messages

590
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,420
about the Persian merchant?

591
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,980
Take it easy, Master.

592
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,780
Miss Du is asking for the helps
of other silk merchants.

593
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,860
Remember,

594
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,220
keep the Customs Seal in proper custody.

595
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,020
Yes.

596
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,900
Our people will try to save you.

597
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,300
Just leave now.

598
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,380
Finish all the dishes

599
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,760
and have a good rest.

600
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,740
Whose sea cucumber is it?

601
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,820
It is so slippery and delicious.

602
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,460
I want to buy some gold threads
from Mr. Dong.

603
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,260
I believe Miss Du won’t

604
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,500
have invited me to a meal without cause.

605
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,860
But Miss Du.

606
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,780
Your master’s temper is really unbearable.

607
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,980
Last month

608
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,460
at Fengman Restaurant,

609
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,500
I proposed a toast to him

610
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,900
but he just humiliated me

611
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,060
in public.

612
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
I heard

613
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,100
you wanted to buy a mansion

614
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,940
at Xinghua Lane of Western City

615
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,940
where officials gather.

616
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,660
I happen to have a discounted plot

617
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,260
ready for sale.

618
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,460
Miss, you should take a second thought.

619
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,060
Do you really want to sell this plot?

620
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,540
The gold threads determine
the reputation of my silk store.

621
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,100
I have to sell it however reluctant I am.

622
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,300
Come on.

623
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,100
I propose a toast to you, Mr. Dong,

624
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,020
as a token of good faith.

625
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,580
I appreciate your straightforwardness.

626
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Congratulations on our cooperation

627
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,100
with this cup of liquor.

628
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,890
Miss.

629
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,140
Cheers.

630
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,740
We need to taste the vintages

631
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,540
of this brewery more
in order to know its value.

632
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,340
One more cup, Miss Du.

633
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,180
We shall contact with each other more

634
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,280
and help each other more in the future.

635
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,620
Mr. Dong,

636
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,220
I am not good at drinking.

637
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,340
I have to leave now.

638
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,900
How dare this old goat

639
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,780
harass you like that!

640
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,300
He must pay for it in the future!

641
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,100
Father refuses to find the gold threads
for us.

642
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,380
If we can buy the gold threads from him,

643
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,060
I don’t care about such harassment.

644
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,900
But

645
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,500
we shouldn’t allow that kind of people…

646
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,380
Qingliu and I spent so many years

647
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,860
and efforts

648
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,460
developing Xinsilu

649
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,500
into the No. 1 brand of Silver City.

650
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,380
I can’t stand

651
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,580
its failure overnight.

652
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,460
Only more threads

653
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,620
can guarantee our success.

654
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,540
Mr. Du ordered all merchants
not to involve in the issue of gold threads!

655
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,420
Madam.

656
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,020
You don’t have to, Madam.

657
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,500
We can wait at the entrance.

658
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,180
Thank you for your kindness.

659
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,340
Who are you?

660
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
What do you mean, Dachun?

661
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,620
It is you.

662
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,340
All people of the city know

663
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,620
Xinsilu’s gold threads are lost.

664
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,060
Everybody is looking for them.

665
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,460
Nobody dares to have it.

666
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,460
Just take it back.

667
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,940
As we agreed,

668
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,620
I only need to help you

669
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,460
sell the gold threads at the black market.

670
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,100
But

671
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,060
how can it be interpreted as

672
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,700
a stealing practice of our Longzhu Gang?

673
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,100
I didn’t finish the job on the one hand.

674
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,060
I even brought troubles
to my master and brothers.

675
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:28,900
No.

676
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,940
I must go back to tell master the truth.

677
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,180
I don’t need the money.

678
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,820
My mother hasn’t seen me for days.

679
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,740
I must go back home.

680
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,060
Deng Dachun,

681
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,900
I will show you a place.

682
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,580
If Dachun really stole the gold threads,

683
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,100
sold the goods at the black market

684
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,340
and stopped it

685
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,460
at the sight of me,

686
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,740
why didn’t he come back home?

687
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,900
Is he hiding himself from somebody?

688
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,900
I didn’t expect Mr. Zhu was having an eye
on the Customs Seal.

689
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,100
I must find the gold threads soon.

690
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,180
It seems

691
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,900
she didn’t instruct her boys
to steal the gold threads.

692
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,900
Did Longzhu Gang’s men have an interest

693
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,540
in the gold threads one their own?

694
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,300
= Northern Gate =

695
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,140
Next.

696
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,180
Next.

697
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,940
Check it carefully!

698
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,180
Next.

699
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,150
Make way!

Next.

702
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,140
Miss Du.

703
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,820
Thanks for your efforts these days, sir.

704
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
It is a little cold at night.

705
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,940
Buy some liquors to warm up

706
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,100
with the money.

707
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,020
You are welcome, Miss Du.

708
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,140
Some valuables were already stolen.

709
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,420
It is their duty.

710
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,300
Yes.

711
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,340
But my father is busy today

712
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,580
and doesn’t have time for it.

713
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,940
So I have come here personally

714
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,380
- to ask for your help.
- Next.

715
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,860
After discovery of the gold threads,

716
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,980
our store will certainly
reward you heavily.

717
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,780
I will also

718
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,380
praise you to my father more.

719
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,260
Thanks, Miss Du.

720
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,950
Next.

721
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,340
It is just a piece of cake.

722
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,060
Mr. Commissioner
doesn’t have to worry about it.

723
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,300
Listen,

724
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,980
search carefully!

725
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,340
Never miss anybody and any place.

726
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,060
- Yes!
- Yes!

727
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,820
How cold it is!

728
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,940
Do you know the stories
of Phoenix with Extended Wings

729
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,180
and Immortal Offering Fruits?

730
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,140
I don’t know.

731
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,940
Foreign dishes.

732
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,020
Master Long, just tell us

733
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,620
and widen our horizon.

734
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,220
Phoenix with Extended Wings

735
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,380
can cure the crooked bones

736
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
due to long-term crouching.

737
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,460
As the legend goes,

738
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,940
the limbs of a person

739
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,740
are locked onto an enormous log cross

740
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,100
in a suspended way.

741
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,380
Finally, the wooden frame is rotated.

742
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,940
It is said

743
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,260
the person will be in severe pain

744
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,660
and suffer bone dislocation
and even bone fracture.

745
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,380
Is it a torture for prisoners in history?

746
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,100
That is really so cruel.

747
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,820
Yes.

748
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,700
I don’t care.

749
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,060
Comfortable.

750
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,660
- Don’t look. Don’t look.
- No.

751
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,460
Go, go, go.

752
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,020
Comfortable.

753
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,180
One is an accident.

754
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,420
Two means good luck.

755
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,220
Three indicates destiny’s child.

756
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,060
I hope Dachun is okay.

757
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,060
I hope my gang brothers are okay.

758
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,460
So many?

759
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,700
It must be very bad luck.

760
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,020
It is the decision.

761
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,620
Master Qiyan.

762
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,580
Aren’t those guys

763
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,540
the witch doctors of Longzhu Gang?

764
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,540
What did they come here for?

765
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,220
For what?

766
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,460
Longzhu Gang has broken up

767
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,140
and these members certainly

768
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,300
had to come and embrace our gang.

769
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,740
Congratulations, Master Qiyan.

770
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,860
The stories about Longzhu Gang’s fighting

771
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,580
and brawling are spread far and wide.

772
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,580
I believe

773
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,500
their reputation is certainly spoiled.

774
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,940
Moreover, it is also said

775
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,020
many Longzhu Gang members
can’t hold on.

776
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,260
Many of them have left these days.

777
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,060
Master Qiyan,
your plot is really a great one

778
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,820
as it not only defamed the Longzhu Gang,

779
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,620
threw Miss Long into the prison and

780
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,660
brought back the silkworm business,

781
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,980
but also won over many outlets.

782
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,500
We got so many benefits with it. Great!

783
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,060
Shut up!

784
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,020
Yes.

785
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,740
Do you expect them to hear it?

786
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,740
Our dependents must

787
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,140
make their due contributions one day.

788
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,380
Who is that guy

789
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,060
who came to our tobacco house

790
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,980
for smoking from time to time,

791
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,860
act as a jailer

792
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,220
and has a mole on the chin?

793
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,020
Zhang Liulang.

794
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,220
Exactly, it is him.

795
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
Long Aoyi.

796
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,220
It is time for you

797
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,260
