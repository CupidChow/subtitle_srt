favorable for intelligence development.

Small! Small! Small!

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
So this is what you thought of?

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,840
What’s wrong with it?

40
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,750
This requires more thinking
than listening to music

41
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,960
to help develop the brain.

42

This place is a mess.

This place is perfect.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,880
Here you can learn to be astute, be bold,

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,350
be cautious and calculative.

47

Big! Big! Big! Big!

and give it to others.

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,540
Don’t let her play again.

55
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,050
Yes.

This is your trick, isn’t it?

As long as you’re staying with me,

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,310
it’s my responsibility to take care

73

Get out of my face!

81

Don’t vent your anger on servants.

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,750
Bring your enemy down

83
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,360
if you don’t want to lose.

84
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
Mother, what brings you here?

85
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,280
Look at you.

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
Are you still a noble prince?

87
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
You’re no better than

88
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,870
rascals in the brothel.

89
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,910
Mother...

90
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,560
Do you still care about me?

91
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,710
All you can think of

92
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,190
is that tramp.

93
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
But she’s with Prince Jun now.

94
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,680
Once she gives birth to a boy,

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,840
that man will be most likely

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,080
to replace Crown Prince.

97
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,240
And what about you? A complete failure!

98
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
A disgrace

99
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,360
who indulges himself in drinks!

100
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,190
At this point,

101
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,630
you aren’t half as good as Li Qingliu.

102
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,360
No wonder His Majesty neglects you.

103
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,310
You’re hopeless.

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,750
Mother, I...

105
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,310
I wish you weren’t my son!

106
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,280
I’m sorry.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
Get up already!

108
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,590
Stop making a scene.

109
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,710
Yes.

110
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
Starting from now,

111
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,080
keep in mind who you’re against.

112
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,710
Don’t forget you’re a prince

113
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,150
and the future...

114
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,750
Don’t let me down.

115
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,590
I made soup

116
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,150
with spinach from India. Have a taste.

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
I’m sorry about last time.

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,000
Xiaoxian,

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,190
you don’t need to do this every day.

120
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,720
Well,

121
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,270
we’re already engaged.

122
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,390
It’s my duty to take care of you.

123
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,190
I’m sorry if I didn’t make myself clear

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,070
and gave you the wrong idea.

125
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,920
You’ve always been

126
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,800
my closest partner
either in Silver City or Chang’an.

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
I regard you as my sister.

128
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,830
If you’re in danger,

129
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,480
I’ll do anything to protect you.

130
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,120
That’s why I agreed

131
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,920
to the engagement at first.

132
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,870
Had I refused it,

133
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,630
you would’ve been hurt.

134
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,040
I promise

135
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
that I’ll do my best

136
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
to honor the betrothal

137
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,120
and make you feel safe.

138
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,720
But let me be clear,

139
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,750
that’s not love.

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,510
What about Long Aoyi?

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
I already have the answer.

142
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,390
All I’m asking is for you

143
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,870
to commit to our engagement.

144
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,160
The rest

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,160
is fine with me.

146
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,750
As per Tang’s tradition,

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,240
to hold the ritual
in the first month of every season,

148
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,270
Xiaoxian of the Du Clan

149
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,120
is conferred Princess Jun-to-be.

150
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,070
The wedding ceremony

151
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
will be held on the first day

152
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,830
of winter in the 12th year.

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,310
Last night’s mist disappeared

154
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,630
after sunrise.

155
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,680
Your Highness

156
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,600
are blessed by heaven.

157
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,920
- This is my first visit to the harem.
- Today’s ritual

158
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,430
- I must find something.
- went smoothly.

159
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,510
I think

160
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,000
Her Highness is as wise as Buddha.

161
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,190
She could

162
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,120
predict the weather effortlessly.

163
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,040
That’s incredible.

164
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,480
She has a fine grasp

165
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,000
of The Book of Changes.

166
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,600
Would they ever stop talking?

167
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,160
Your Highness, this fruit came from Tibet.

168
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,920
You can have a taste.

169
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,280
Excuse me.

170
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,260
A word, please.

171
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,240
And taste this, Your Highness.

172
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,310
These grapes

173
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
just arrived from Arabia.

174
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,160
They’re fresh.

175
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,720
You’re gorgeous.

176
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,120
May I ask you a few things?

177
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,830
I’m new to the palace

178
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,750
and I’m interested in
a particular pattern.

179
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,040
Could you tell me about it?

180
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,920
Which one?

181
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,780
That...

182
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,920
Greetings, Concubine Feng.

183
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,830
Nice to see you.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,830
I love the ready-to-wear

185
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,220
you gave me last time.

186
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,600
Do you still have that kind of fabric?

187
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,070
I’m not sure.

188
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,470
It came all the way from Arabia.

189
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,590
If you like it,

190
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,680
I’ll bring you some.

191
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,000
That’s too kind of you.

192
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,230
How much is it? Is it expensive?

193
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,790
Fine birds

194
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,190
deserve fine feathers.

195
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,630
It’d be a waste to hand them out

196
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,190
to the humble.

197
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,630
Thank you so much.

198
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,410
Am I interrupting you two?

199
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,710
I’ll leave you alone then.

200
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Don’t worry.

201
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
I barely know her.

202
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,070
Let’s talk over there.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,070
My respects to you, Your Highness.

204
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,640
Have a seat. Try the grapes.

205
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,070
Stop!

206
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,310
Are you a new maid?

207
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,760
Where are your manners?

208
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,670
My respects to you, Concubine De.

209
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,310
You’ve probably forgotten

210
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,190
that we had met twice.

211
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,120
I remember it.

212
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,400
You dressed up as a foreign dancer

213
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,040
in an attempt to seduce Prince Jun.

214
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,550
You played the same trick
on my son, Zhao, too,

215
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,800
but failed.

216
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,000
You’re running a business
in the city, aren’t you?

217
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,280
Yes.

218
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,190
Here’s a piece of advice.

219
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,120
Always follow the rules

220
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,670
in the palace.

221
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Do not try anything funny.

222
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
If you do,

223
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,000
there will be consequences.

224
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,430
I understand.

225
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,400
Let’s toast Your Highness first.

226
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,590
Drink with me.

227
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,280
Dig in.

228
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,470
The more you eat, the happier I become.

229
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,120
Here.

230
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,550
Try this.

231
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,240
Your Highness, I hope
you have a good appetite.

232
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,520
We’ve had so much fun today.

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,710
Forget about the investigation.

234
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,800
They all ignore me.

235
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,160
Tell the kitchen

236
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,710
to make

237
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,190
waxberry wine

238
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,120
and mulberry wine.

239
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,160
They’re good, especially for women.

240
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,540
Yes, I will.

241
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,190
The water shield

242
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,640
isn’t cooked well.

243
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,190
It’s better to be stewed with tofu.

244
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,400
Agreed.

245
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,550
I had that dish

246
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,930
- back in a remote place called Jia’ermu.
- Your Highness.

247
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,920
Try it.

248
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,590
Locals there knew how to cook it.

249
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,090
Have you heard of that place?

250
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,310
Jia’ermu

251
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,570
is completely different from our state.

252
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,180
I knew you wouldn’t believe it.

253
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,520
How is that tiny place

254
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,950
compared to our vast land?

255
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,160
But it’s true.

256
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,590
In Jia’ermu,

257
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,430
women are superior to men.

258
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,950
You think I’m lying?

259
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,310
Let me explain it to you in detail.

260
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,300
People there...

261
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,950
Your Highness, the rule says

262
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,920
to eat in silence.

263
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,110
She should be beaten
for breaking it.

264
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,800
Every dog has its day.

265
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,520
Don’t challenge the locals.

266
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,280
Is that so?

267
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,470
That’s unthinkable!

268
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,800
I think it’s fun.

269
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,680
Right?

270
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,750
What’s so fun?

271
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,670
Come here.

272
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,270
Share it with me.

273
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,750
Come over here.

274
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,790
What is it about?

275
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,870
Your Highness,

276
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,440
it’s about Jia’ermu.

277
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I’ve been there.

278
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,750
That place is special.

279
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Men there

280
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,670
are inferior to women

281
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,750
who enjoy higher status.

282
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,200
The head of the household

283
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,270
is the grandmother,

284
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
who’s in charge of finance.

285
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,270
Women have their own boudoirs

286
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,910
to live with their love.

287
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,150
Once they give birth,

288
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,120
their grandmothers will raise the kids.

289
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,790
So,

290
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,080
they don’t need to worry about

291
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,320
being abandoned.

292
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,840
That’s unheard of.

293
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,510
Write it down.

294
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,870
What’s more,

295
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,670
you can only see women in the streets,

296
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,000
such as female soldiers, shopkeepers.

297
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,320
Men seldom go out

298
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,440
as they’re at home raising their children.

299
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,600
It’s true.

300
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,200
Their customs are opposite to ours.

301
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,360
We can visit there some time.

302
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,320
I’ve never heard of that.

303
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,670
Put it back.

304
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,320
That move doesn’t count.

305
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,790
Let me think again.

306
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,480
Father, an emperor

307
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,720
should never cheat.

308
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,290
I’m a mere beginner

309
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,320
in chess.

310
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,320
And I’m your father.

311
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,290
Can’t you be easy on me?

312
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,120
Prince Zhao has arrived.

313
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,500
My respects to you, Father.

314
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,740
Sure. Come here.

315
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,170
You’re in a good mood, Father.

316
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,800
Are you playing board games with Qingliu?

317
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,810
A few days ago,

318
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,500
he received a group of merchants

319
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,660
from Funan,

320
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,100
who gave him this chess.

321
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,670
It’s a fun game.

322
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,220
So you’re playing chess.

323
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
I know a thing or two

324
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,020
when learning board games

325
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,170
from Minister Yuan.

326
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,170
You can play it, too?

327
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,970
Yes.

328
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,800
Good. You should

329
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,900
come to the palace more often

330
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,020
to play chess with me.

331
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,480
Father,

332
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,340
I was immature.

333
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,930
I was out traveling all the time

334
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,260
without sparing enough time for you.

335
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,970
From now on,

336
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,020
I’ll be with you as much as I can.

337
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,860
I’m glad to hear it.

338
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,810
I hope

339
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,290
you two

340
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,170
can work together to assist Crown Prince.

341
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,220
Understand?

342
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,860
Yes, Father.

343
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,140
Fantastic!

344
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,220
Miss, have you made friends

345
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
with those ladies?

346
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,650
I tried so hard to entertain them,

347
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,100
but they invited Princess Jun

348
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,410
to have desserts.

349
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,900
How is your hand?

350
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,920
It’s fine.

351
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,350
We got company.

352
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,220
Miss Long, it’s really you!

353
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,770
You’re Gengzi’s...

354
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,690
I’m his second sister, Menghan.

355
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,050
I recognize you.

356
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:30,770
Gengzi said

357
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,650
you left for Chang’an
without telling him.

358
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
So you’re in the palace all this time.

359
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,290
We had

360
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,290
a nasty fight last year,

361
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,260
then I left and came here.

362
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,140
But I didn’t know

363
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,700
I’d be prohibited

364
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,910
from getting out.

365
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,220
I couldn’t even

366
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,050
send him a message.

367
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,980
How is he?

368
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,260
He’s doing well.

369
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,720
It’ll be a relief to know you’re safe.

370
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
What do you want to say to him?

371
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,690
I’ll tell him.

372
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,650
Thank you!

373
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,050
Many in the palace

374
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,380
have lost contact with their families

375
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,980
just like me.

376
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,940
Can you help them, too?

377
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,050
Of course.

378
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,170
I’ll be your messenger.

379
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,810
Thanks. Come here.

380
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,990
- Greetings, my lady.
- Greetings, my lady.

381
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,260
That’s a huge crowd, Menghan.

382
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,140
As a former gang member,

383
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,980
it’s as if you’re having a gang

384
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,740
of your own.

385
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,930
Please write down the names

386
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,290
and the addresses of your families.

387
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:17,860
I’ll let you know

388
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,140
once I hear from them.

389
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,530
- Thank you, my lady.
- Thank you, my lady.

390
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,860
This is great!

391
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:22,900
Menghan,

392
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,740
I’d like to ask you something.

393
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,500
Have you ever seen
this pattern in the palace?

394
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,770
I don’t think so.

395
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,170
If it’s not too much trouble,

396
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,980
can you keep an eye on it?

397
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,770
If you see it,

398
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,690
don’t forget to tell me.

399
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
I will.

400
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,290
Thank you.

401
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
The Search of the Supernatural says

402
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,290
Li Ji, born in the Warring States Period,

403
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,570
made a name for killing a snake.

404
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,100
She was a woman

405
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,050
of unusual strength.

406
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,380
And what did she do?

407
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,260
She mixed 500 kilograms

408
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,620
of grains with honey.

409
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,620
That was half a ton.

410
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,570
She did that all by herself.

411
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,770
Can you imagine how heavy that was?

412
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,050
Can you?

413
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,620
How did she do that?

414
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,770
If girls now are as strong as her...

415
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,370
I haven’t finished.

416
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,340
What were you doing?

417
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,030
Nothing.

418
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,020
Nothing?

419
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,390
Weren’t you entertaining girls?

420
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,820
No, no, no.

421
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,250
What were you thinking?

422
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,690
Stop it!

423
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,040
= Tang =
I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.

424
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,940
= Tang =

425
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,210
Miss,

426
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,170
he was hitting on
girls with his story.

427
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,490
That jerk!

428
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,960
I must end him now!

429
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,050
There’s nothing I can do.

430
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,960
Don’t you see she’s jealous?

431
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,650
Xiaoqin, I bought you buns

432
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,560
with extra sugar.

433
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,050
Please calm down.

434
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,650
Is it sweet?

435
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,060
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

436
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,730
You know the drill. The winner

437
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,690
gets to ask a question.

438
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,970
The loser must be honest.

439
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,580
I’m totally up for it.

440
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,410
Middle finger, ring finger,
which one is it?

441
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,930
Snake eats frogs. I won.

442
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,580
Go ahead and ask me.

443
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,410
Your eyes are sparkling

444
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,410
and you’re giggling.

445
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,620
Is something going on

446
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,730
between you and him?

447
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,540
Speak!

448
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,100
Where are you guys now?

449
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,010
Nothing happened.

450
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,970
Tell me the truth.

451
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,540
We did that.

452
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,820
That. What?

453
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,970
You mean kiss?

454
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,170
Been there, done that.

455
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,620
Go on.

456
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,060
Hands out, show the fingers.

457
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,000
Two tigers eat the snake, so my turn.

458
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,620
Miss,

459
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,250
if you’re

460
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,340
so used to kissing,

461
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,060
tell me,

462
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
how many times have you done it?

463
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,690
And is the one you’ve kissed Prince Jun?

464
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,490
Hell no!

465
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Who would kiss him?

466
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,650
What are you doing now?

467
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,210
My stomach hurts.

468
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,970
Watch your behaviors.

469
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,860
What do you mean?

470
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,580
I always behave like this

471
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,540
just like you always wear a stone face.

472
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,170
What’s wrong? Are you upset?

473
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,690
Because of you,

474
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,490
I can’t make friends or do business.

475
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,210
And now, I can’t even get mad?

476
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,730
Why are you nice to others

477
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,380
but hostile to me?

478
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,650
Don’t forget

479
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,860
who you are.

480
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,620
Who am I?

481
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,140
A mother?

482
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,730
Anyway,

483
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,820
I’m carrying the baby.

484
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,970
I can do whatever I want with it.

485
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,860
It’s not your concern.

486
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,540
Don’t forget

487
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
you’re no longer

488
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,540
a local gang leader.

489
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,930
All eyes

490
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,730
are on you.

491
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,410
Let them be.

492
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,170
It’s none of their business

493
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,210
or yours.

494
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,650
We’ve had a baby together.

495
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,930
You’re my woman.

496
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,060
How is that not my business?

497
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,580
Are you talking to me

498
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,210
as my husband?

499
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,490
You’d better get used to that.

500
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,250
Take the medicine
for the sake of the baby.

501
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,620
Finish the entire bowl,

502
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,690
or take a double dose tomorrow.

503
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,060
Miss, did he lecture you again?

504
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,410
That control freak!

505
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,060
Whose father does he think he is?

506
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Lower your voice!

507
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,930
I’m telling the truth.

508
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,970
I’m still

509
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,060
a virgin.

510
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,300
So you two didn’t...

511
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,970
My memory about that night

512
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,010
is vague,

513
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,380
but I remember

514
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,690
the bed sheet was clean.

515
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:53,930
What if

516
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,580
he finds out you’re faking it?

517
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,970
As long as he doesn’t see this,

518
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,780
I’m safe.

519
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,340
I can bear with the rest.

520
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,340
= Xishi Market =

521
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,940
= Sold Out =

522
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,860
= Rice =

523
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,770
Get out. It’s all sold out.

524
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,510
Please give me some rice.

525
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,010
Go away.

526
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,060
I came at dawn

527
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,860
but could only leave empty-handed.

528
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,920
Please give me some.

529
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,770
Carts went in and out all night.

530
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,330
How come it’s out of stock so soon?

531
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,340
What should I do?

532
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
= Chang’an =
I just need some rice.

533
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,650
I’m starving.

534
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,010
Yan Bin,

535
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,730
go and check what’s happening.

536
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,060
I’m begging you.

537
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,970
We need something to eat, or we’ll die.

538
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,170
Excuse me.

539
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,340
What’s going on?

540
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,250
Who’s dying?

541
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,060
Not you, of course.

542
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,690
Cities surrounding Chang’an

543
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,210
are trapped by famine.

544
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,390
Locals have to rely on

545
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,970
government hand-outs.

546
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,180
But now,

547
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,110
they’re not enough.

548
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,860
Food is in short supply.

549
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,240
All my family members

550
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,440
are too weak to stand.

551
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,100
I’m afraid

552
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,770
we won’t survive this year.

553
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,970
Yes. What should we do?

554
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,400
My family is also dying.

555
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,160
Give us some rice, sir.

556
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,670
- Please. I’m begging you.
- Go away!

557
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,580
The famine is severe.

558
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,820
Shouldn’t the Ministry of Revenue
do something?

559
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,230
Your Majesty,

560
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,860
arrangements have been made

561
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,730
to divert grains from the south

562
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
to the north.

563
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,340
But

564
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,780
rivers are dry

565
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,150
at this time of the year,

566
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,240
hence

567
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,470
the delay.

568
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,820
Delay?

569
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,790
Can people’s need for food be delayed?

570
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,900
Father,

571
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,860
the government reserve is running low.

572
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,820
My advice is to market private reserves

573
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,250
to bring down the price
jacked up by hoarding.

574
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,210
What do you think of

575
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,690
Prince Jun’s idea?

576
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,490
With all due respect,

577
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,620
that’s simply impractical.

578
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,350
Without enough crops,

579
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,060
what can we offer them?

580
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,820
Father,

581
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,620
famine doesn’t rise overnight,

582
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,690
and the number of victims
continues to grow.

583
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,250
Marketing private reserves
is of little use.

584
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,410
Your Majesty,

585
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,140
I believe

586
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,380
Prince Jun’s idea

587
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,060
will benefit the public.

588
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,250
Can you elaborate it, Minister Yuan?

589
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,620
Prince Zhao calls

590
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,170
Prince Jun’s idea

591
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,170
of little use,

592
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,100
but given the current circumstance,

593
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,410
it’s still better than doing nothing.

594
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,580
Thank you for
speaking up for me, Minister.

595
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,930
I appreciate that.

596
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,340
You truly care about the civilians.

597
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,620
I was only doing my job.

598
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,210
Something is still bothering me.

599
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,380
I’d like to hear your thoughts on that.

600
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,970
Signs of famine appeared long ago.

601
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,380
Providing disaster relief
is the priority,

602
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,930
but Ministries lag in response.

603
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,170
Why didn’t Father punish them?

604
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,210
Have you seen bamboos in Sichuan?

605
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:50,780
I have.

606
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,490
There are always
withered ones in the forest.

607
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,100
Why not remove them

608
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,340
and only keep the healthy ones?

609
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,730
It’s simple.

610
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,170
To protect the forest from the wind.

611
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,250
The withered can serve
as natural buffers.

612
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,620
If I understand it correctly,

613
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,650
it’s necessary to...

614
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,780
Patience is the key

615
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,450
to political success.

616
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,690
We need more than one voice

617
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,730
whether they’re good or bad.

618
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,490
The ruler always wants something new.

619
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,690
So we need to include other voices.

620
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,690
And they can set ours off to advantage.

621
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,140
Just let them bark.

622
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,860
Lesson learned.

623
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,100
Thank you for your teaching.

624
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,250
“Women’s routine is as follows:

625
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,650
rise and get dressed at dawn.

626
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,690
Then wash and spruce up.

627
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:15,380
Collect wood to tend the kitchen fire.”

628
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,210
Stop.

629
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Are you Lady Long?

630
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,100
Me?

631
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,970
I’m Long Aoyi.

632
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,410
What do you think

633
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,970
“spruce up” means

634
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,860
said in Principles for Women?

635
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,820
They wake up at dawn

636
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,170
and are too sleepy

637
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,730
to dress themselves up.

638
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,060
What’s so funny?

639
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,100
The establishment of Tang

640
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,100
is the result of

641
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,620
both Founding Father’s effort

642
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,930
and Empress Dou’s thrift and tenacity.

643
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,060
Everyone should attend the lecture

644
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,930
in a plain outfit.

645
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,690
Lady Long,

646
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,250
yours is extravagant.

647
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,730
Nobody told me about it.

648
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,340
I dressed up for the occasion.

649
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,140
“Eat three meals properly.

650
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,900
Breakfast and dinner
are equally important.

651
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,140
Don’t be lazy or dull.”

652
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,380
Lady Long,

653
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,450
what do those sentences mean?

654
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,900
They’re well-written.

655
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,650
Those lines tell us

656
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,730
women should fill themselves up.

657
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,860
Eat the same amount
in the morning and at night.

658
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,730
Don’t skip the meals.

659
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,650
Or when you’re hungry,

660
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,300
no one will cook for you.

661
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,730
Lady Long,

662
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
Consort Dowager especially

663
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,730
summoned you and Princess Jun

664
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,300
to study manners in the palace.

665
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,010
You’re being disrespectful.

666
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,100
Give me your hand.

667
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,170
Your Highness, Stewardess Zhai,

668
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,900
please be lenient with her.

669
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,300
She’s of humble birth

670
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,210
without

671
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,410
proper education,

672
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,520
so she misread the text.

673
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,860
Save it.

674
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,100
Go ahead and beat me.

675
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:20,820
You...

676
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,730
Stewardess Zhai.

677
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,380
Yes, Your Highness.

678
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,250
She’s

679
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,420
smart and delightful.

680
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,930
Spare her this time.

681
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,690
With that being said,

682
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,450
you’re rude.

683
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,760
So I’ll give you detention.

684
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,360
That’s worse than being beaten.

685
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,700
= Five =

686
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,060
I’m starving.

687
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,490
What’s this character?

688
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,580
How should I write it?

689
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,850
Lady Long.

690
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,340
What took you so long?

691
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,970
Come here.

692
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,170
This is Gengzi’s letter to you.

693
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,210
= To Menghan =
Others’ letters

694
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:18,900
= To Menghan =
are inside, too.

695
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,620
Thank you.

696
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,210
I’m forever in debt to you.

697
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,620
Don’t mention it.

698
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,540
Do you have any food?

699
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,210
My stomach is growling.

700
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,610
I heard you’re being punished.

701
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,100
Don’t get me started.

702
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,170
By the way,

703
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,060
have you found that pattern?

704
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,490
I didn’t pay attention to it

705
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,140
until you told me to.

706
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,980
To my surprise,

707
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,650
carp pattern is widely used in the palace,

708
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,820
but not the one

709
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,970
you showed me.

710
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,250
Money makes the mare go.

711
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,490
Nothing comes for free.

712
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,430
These are all for you.

713
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
What are they?

714
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,770
You’re giving them to us?

715
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,010
Of course.

716
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,090
Consider these bonuses.

717
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,200
Life in the palace is dull.

718
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,440
Sweet raisins

719
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,930
and the rose perfume
can make you feel better.

720
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
These raisins are from the west.

721
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,290
This is the rose perfume?

722
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,340
Only ladies in the harem have it.

723
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,300
There’s one for each of you.

724
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,520
Pay me if you want more.

725
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,060
Take it.

726
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,870
Help yourselves.

727
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,140
Here you are.

728
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,900
Is he here?

729
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,210
He’s responsible for preparing

730
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,370
bathwater for consorts and concubines.

731
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,900
It’s you.

732
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,680
Thank you.

733
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,650
I’ve never seen these,

734
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,110
let alone touch it.

735
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,100
There’s more

736
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,210
if you continue to help me.

737
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,580
Have you taken yours?

738
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,130
- Thank you, my lady.
- And you?

739
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,300
Although Zhuo let us in,

740
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,170
he warned us
not to go any further.

741
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,650
If others see us here...

742
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,340
Relax. Be quiet.

743
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,300
Is she most fond of jades?

744
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,690
Look. She owns
the biggest piece in the palace.

745
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
Where is it?

746
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,140
Over there.

747
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,340
The pattern doesn’t match,

748
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,490
but the shape of it

749
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,140
seems to be unique.

750
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,340
Such carp pendants are nothing unusual.

751
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,970
We’re in trouble.

752
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,060
Let’s go.

753
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,060
Is this what Lady Long offered them?

754
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,630
It’s said she used to
have her own business

755
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,910
and a gang,

756
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,320
so she has connections.

757
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,300
Lady Long has arrived.

758
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,490
Long Aoyi pays respects to Your Grace.

759
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,720
Please have a seat.

760
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,330
Is this to make tea?

761
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,130
Prince Jun and I

762
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,620
learned this from the Zheluo Tribe.

763
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,410
It tastes smooth and refreshing.

764
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,100
I’m interested in

765
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,630
sea mud from Arabia.

766
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,690
Do you have access to it?

767
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,560
I can certainly

768
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,520
pull some strings.

769
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,340
But honestly, you’re a natural beauty

770
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,380
from a prominent family.

771
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,350
You don’t need extra beauty care.

772
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,680
Check out my forehead.

773
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,900
Is that all?

774
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,930
That birthmark is troubling you?

775
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,970
Do you know how to remove it?

776
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,650
Locals in Silver City

777
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,620
marinate lemons

778
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,270
in honeycombs,

779
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,380
and then apply a few slices

780
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,900
to their faces for skin-lightening.

781
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,540
Lemon?

782
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,920
Never heard of that.

783
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,010
Leave it to me. I’ll get you some.

784
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,860
Now I understand why Prince Jun likes you.

785
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,620
Why are you suddenly bringing him up?

786
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,930
Your Grace,

787
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Prince Jun is looking for Lady Long.

788
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,300
Why?

789
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,570
He said you’re pregnant

790
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,900
and shouldn’t be out for too long.

791
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,260
And it’s time to take your medicine.

792
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,130
There he is. Perfect timing.

793
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,700
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

794
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,010
Terrific! Even the soup is to die for.

795
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,280
Who’s going to die?

796
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,610
Heavens!

797
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,010
Are they pork hocks?

798
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,970
Have you taken your medicine?

799
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,930
I have.

800
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,610
You should take it

801
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,300
under supervision.

802
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,410
Why?

803
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,340
You think I don’t know

804
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,260
you’ve had others

805
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,900
watch my every move.

806
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,300
I’m pregnant, not imprisoned.

807
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,010
Your hocks are burned.

808
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:52,970
Remember these?

809
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,450
Black hocks, Silver City’s special.

810
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,820
They gave you the runs.

811
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,050
Hold on.

812
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,610
Mint leaves can balance the grease.

813
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,450
You have nothing to worry about.

814
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,010
You’re

815
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,900
this baby’s father,

816
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,780
and I’m his mother.

817
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,490
I’ll take good care of him.

818
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,380
Nothing bad will happen.

819
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,940
Because he doesn’t exist.

820
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,530
I’m unfamiliar with the etiquette,

821
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,740
so I’m going to the palace

822
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,050
every day to study it.

823
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,320
Of course not.

824
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,940
I barely have enough time to investigate.

825
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,930
Long Aoyi,

826
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,300
do not chat freely

827
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,530
with others if I’m not around.

828
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,300
Others like who?

829
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,860
Prince Zhao?

830
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,780
Why?

831
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,930
I’ll get jealous.

832
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,010
Slow down.

833
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,220
Good lord,

834
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,970
he’s never been so blunt.

835
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,860
What should I do?

836
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,220
Just stick to the fact that I’m pregnant.

837
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,740
Silver City is over
a thousand kilometers away.

838
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,700
It takes at least two weeks
to get here by water and land.

839
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,180
How did the hocks arrive so fast?

840
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,360
So he’s fishing for information.

841
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,550
I was out all day.

842
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,590
My ankles are swollen.

843
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,900
I’m swelling all over
because of the pregnancy.

844
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,610
My legs are sore.

845
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,090
There’s a secret channel by water.

846
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,740
Where is it?

847
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,450
Don’t leave me hanging.

848
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,160
It hurts. Be gentle.

849
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,600
