32

Miss Long, now you’re not upset anymore.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,030
Please tell me

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,400
about your ideas.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,710
What’s wrong?

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
I’d like to

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,240
make all my ideas come true.

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,000
But my hand is injured.

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,120
The doctor doesn’t allow me to work.

40
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,800
Don’t worry.

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,470
Mr. Li has said

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,750
that all of our designers

43
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,000
are at your call.

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,080
You can tell them what to do.

45
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,000
Is that okay for you?

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,590
Kind of.

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,150
Pound.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,280
Softer.

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,710
People can only work well
if they eat and sleep well.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,150
I’ve designed a Floating Pillow for you.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
No, no.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,590
I meant to cut a hole here,

53
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,430
and stitch the rest of them.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,030
Show me.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,520
How can I do it with my injured hand?

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,800
You do it, then.

57
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,430
I...

58
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,000
Forget it, I don’t want to draw.

59
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,360
Yeah, that’s what I meant.

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,590
Only he can get me.

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,590
What are you looking at?
It’s a compliment.

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,190
What pattern did you draw?

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,310
It’s so out of date.

64
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,080
Don’t use that color.

65
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,560
What are you looking?

66
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,030
I read in a book which says

67
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,600
where the porter carries the pole
is his fatigue point.

68
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,430
Floating Pillow must consider this.

69
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,480
Where’s the fatigue point?

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,830
Here?

71
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,630
Or here?

72
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,190
Now it’s on me.

73
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,390
I’d love

74
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,000
a sip of hot sweet soup.

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Or my brain would stop working.

76
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,270
Where can I get you
sweet soup at this time?

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,800
Never mind.

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,480
I can only go to bed then

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,750
since my brain has stopped working.

80
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,000
I’m sleepy.

81
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,070
Sweet soup!

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,390
Where did you go?

83
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,390
Did you make it?

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,630
Nice, Master Li.

85
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,920
Sorry to trouble you.

86
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,630
Can you stop moving?

87
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,000
It’s too hot.

88
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Did you put sugar in the sweet soup?

89
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,360
It’s mild tasting.

90
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,830
Refined sugar is too sweet for patients.

91
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,720
I become more sleepy

92
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,310
after drinking the soup.

93
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,600
Stop it.

94
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
I put wolfberries in the soup
to refresh you.

95
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,310
There’s no way you’re still sleepy.

96
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,030
It can’t stop me from getting hungry.

97
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,960
I have one small additional request.

98
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,360
Here it is.

99
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,120
Pork King.

100
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,360
= Pork Elbow =
I want two and one sauce.

101
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
Alright.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,510
Hurry up.

103
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,750
Here it comes!

104
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,390
Thank you, Sir.

105
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,150
Enjoy.

106
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:40,840
Feed me.

107
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,030
It’s full of people here.

108
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Really?

109
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,200
Come on.

110
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,600
It’s all yours.

111
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,000
The taste is so familiar.

112
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,790
Try it, I promise it’s good.

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,600
So good.

114
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,600
I haven’t had any since

115
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,720
I lived in the Silk Store.

116
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,910
Try it.

117
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,670
Does it taste good?

118
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes.

119
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,000
Told you it tastes better with the sauce.

120
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,480
Seems like you come here a lot.

121
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,440
Of course.

122
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,870
I only come here to eat pork elbow.

123
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,910
Whenever I’m hungry when I was little,

124
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,360
I’d come here to pick up bones as food.

125
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080
Sometimes I got bones with meat
left on them.

126
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,960
The host was nice, he never kicked me out.

127
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,080
Sir, one more please.

128
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:07,870
Two.

129
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Alright.

130
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,720
Enjoy, you two.

131
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,960
Sir, does it hurt?

132
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,720
I’ve had it for long.

133
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
Please don’t touch it.

134
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,910
If I was paralyzed,

135
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
my whole family
would have to beg for food.

136
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,720
Then have a rest in the day when

137
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,320
there isn’t any customer.

138
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,240
I can’t even go to sleep in the nights,

139
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,270
let alone the days.

140
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,200
It’s fine.

141
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,360
We’ll make you a

142
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,670
pillow later.

143
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,200
So that you can have

144
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,670
a good nap in the day.

145
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,510
Only the upper class can afford it.

146
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,910
We are from the Southern city,
we can’t afford it.

147
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,270
The sun is out.

148
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,790
So warm.

149
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,320
I forgot the most important thing.

150
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,630
I didn’t bring money.

151
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,870
Let’s run.

152
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,720
Don’t run. Don’t run.

153
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,000
Sir,

154
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,120
we’re a low-budget operation,
we don’t accept credit.

155
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,200
Sir, what do you say

156
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,440
that let’s call it a day,
I’ll pay double tomorrow.

157
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,480
Well.

158
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,150
Alright, go.

159
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,940
= Du’s Mansion =

160
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,030
Miss,

161
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,870
I’ve heard something

162
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,270
related to Mr. Li.

163
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,000
What is it?

164
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,870
It’s said that

165
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,910
he’s been working for

166
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,360
Long Aoyi lately

167
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,720
for his new designs.

168
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,550
They stay together all the time
in the Design Room.

169
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,360
No one knows what they do.

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,910
I also heard

171
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,670
that Mr. Li brought her

172
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,440
to the roadside restaurant
to make her happy.

173
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,840
Well, you know the place must be dirty.

174
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,150
He may get sick from it.

175
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,790
Miss, you’re too naive.

176
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,910
Sometimes we prefer to believe

177
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,080
things are true.

178
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,440
It’s related to your future with Mr. Li.

179
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,440
Let’s find some ways

180
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,120
to get rid of the girl.

181
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,790
We can’t let her and her fellow

182
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,840
take over the Silk Store.

183
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,910
Now, Master Long

184
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,630
has joined our business in the Silk Store.

185
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,600
Longzhu Gang has become
one of our raw silk supplier.

186
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,480
I think Qingliu let her stay

187
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,960
only because of this.

188
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,720
Well,

189
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,600
don’t you know how to solve it?

190
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,390
Ask someone to look into Longzhu Gang.

191
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Don’t overlook any flaw of them.

192
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,720
This is our workshop of raising
silkworm and reeling.

193
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,150
All of my family’s living

194
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,080
are counting on this.

195
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,120
Take it.

196
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,840
Thank you.

197
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,270
How can their lives be so hard?

198
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,270
Our offer is not low.

199
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,750
What you paid

200
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,360
is in the middle man’s pocket.

201
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,550
Take Qiyan for example,

202
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,550
the silkworm raiser

203
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,670
may end up getting
one twentieth of the deal.

204
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,120
So you want to contract the deal

205
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,080
for them to make more money?

206
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,750
Master Li,

207
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
now you know the difference

208
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
between me and you dishonest business men.

209
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,750
You haven’t made any deal, right?

210
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,030
Not even one

211
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,320
this whole afternoon.

212
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,270
I’ll make a deal with you.

213
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,360
You?

214
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,480
You haven’t grown your hair, okay?

215
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,270
Forget it.

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,440
Tell me, what do you want?

217
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,120
Listen.

218
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,670
Recently

219
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,840
I’ve known a girl.

220
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,080
Look at you, all happy.

221
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,030
Are you trying to rob people in public?

222
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,750
Get up!

223
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,510
Does it hurt?

224
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,030
Where, where is it?

225
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
Who punched me?

226
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,670
I did.

227
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,720
My fellows were a bit rash,

228
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,270
using this way to invite you over.

229
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,440
Please don’t mind.

230
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,000
The fairy is here.

231
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,080
Isn’t she the girl
I’ve been dreaming about?

232
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,670
Don’t be rude.

233
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,510
Our lady is the daughter

234
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,840
of Commissioner Du.

235
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,480
Don’t you dare talk more nonsense.

236
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,200
Watch out for your tongue.

237
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,630
I heard that

238
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,630
your newly appointed Master
is a young girl.

239
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,510
I’d like to know about her.

240
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,270
Beauty,

241
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,240
you are a young girl yourself.

242
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,070
How can you call other people young?

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,350
What did you say? How dare you!

244
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,590
Yue’er.

245
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,350
Speaking of Master Long,

246
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,480
though she looks tiny,

247
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,070
she treats people nicely and fairly.

248
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,350
She used to

249
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,070
be just a little manager in the Gang.

250
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,550
I was never convinced by her.

251
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
But people from the Snake Gang...

252
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,400
Enough with the sweet talk.

253
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,920
I’d like to know

254
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,070
that if Master Long has

255
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,550
any kind of secret tricks.

256
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,720
Please tell me.

257
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,830
Our Master is indeed different
from other girls.

258
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,750
Her behaviors

259
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,480
are pretty manly.

260
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,550
I know.

261
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,590
She loves gambling.

262
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,310
Cock-fighting, Dog-fighting
and cricket game.

263
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
The Shuanglu game, too.

264
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,880
She knows it all.

265
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,350
She drinks, too. Talking about drinking,

266
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,240
let alone the entire Longzhu Gang,

267
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,270
we’re talking about
the entire Silver City.

268
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,510
There aren’t many who can

269
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,680
beat her.

270
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
I know.

271
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Our Master likes food, too.

272
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,000
She can have 10 pork elbows one time.

273
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,830
And she never gains weight.

274
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,110
Unlike me, I gain weight for no reasons.

275
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,030
She loves gambling

276
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,960
because she’s in need of money?

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
You can’t say that, Miss Du.

278
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,240
Everyone needs money in Longzhu Gang.

279
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,240
Many of us are

280
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,550
in lack of food.

281
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,510
Nice.

282
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,590
That’s great, Miss Long.

283
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,110
Your hand is good as new.

284
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,920
In fact,

285
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,440
wearing this has benefits, too.

286
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,720
At least it’s more convenient.

287
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,960
How can it be comfortable?

288
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,750
This way I can make Master Li

289
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,000
take care of me.

290
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,030
You haven’t answered my last question.

291
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,750
Well, I’m the right one to ask.

292
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,920
I’ve been in the Silk Store since 7.

293
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,680
I know well about running business.

294
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,750
What’s the trick of designing and

295
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,000
making your product?

296
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Master Li has said that

297
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,550
the customers matter the most.

298
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,590
It’s essential to figure out
their real needs.

299
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,480
Xinsilu has

300
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,790
studied all the clients’ needs
in the Northern City.

301
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,160
Yeah.

302
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,480
Our advantages of quality and creativeness

303
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,590
put us in an invincible position.

304
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,750
All the process are

305
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,070
in our good hands.

306
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,790
Follow me to the entrance.

307
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,480
Someone is yelling.

308
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,480
Alright.

309
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,440
I’ll be doing my stuff now, Miss Long.

310
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,270
Master.

311
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,920
You’ve been back and forth

312
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,110
for at least 10 times.

313
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,160
Do you need me to call a doctor for you?

314
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,440
It’s OK.

315
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,400
There’s a peddler at the entrance

316
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,720
saying that you and Master Long ordered

317
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,160
7 pork elbows at his place.

318
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,270
I said it’s impossible,

319
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,590
but he sounds pretty genuine.

320
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,310
He said that you owe him money,

321
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,110
I promised that I’d
pay him double tomorrow.

322
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,790
He’s unbelievable.

323
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,270
Broke his own promise.

324
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,590
Pay him 10 times of money

325
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,720
and make him shut up.

326
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,680
10 times?

327
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,680
Pei’s flower style pillow,
made of Porcelain.

328
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,440
Good for driving away the heat,
but not for carrying around.

329
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,310
What’s your comment on this?

330
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,000
Goatskin?

331
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,510
I thought you were planning
to use Indigo Print.

332
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,310
It’s not hard enough,
this is just about right.

333
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,240
These pillows

334
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,590
are in square shape and firm enough.

335
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,640
I don’t know who thought about this,

336
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,680
making it so hard for himself.

337
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,960
But mine added more cattail wool.

338
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,070
Isn’t it a lot better?

339
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,830
Goatskin and cattail wool?

340
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,920
Your floating pillow can actually

341
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,240
make people feel as comfortable
as floating?

342
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,160
Sure it does.

343
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,550
By the way.

344
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,510
You’ve been to the Pork King,

345
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
with all the oil and smoke.

346
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,440
Once goatskin gets oil,
it’d be hard to clean.

347
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,310
Any other options to replace it?

348
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,590
The goatskin has great breathability
and keeps warmth,

349
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,400
it’s the best material for making pillows.

350
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,510
It’d be definitely a bad idea to bring

351
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,400
goatskin to places
that are humid and dirty.

352
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,440
Clients of the Silk Store won’t

353
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,400
go to places like that for sure.

354
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,550
Well, there’s a possibility.

355
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,590
No, there isn’t.

356
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,310
Linen,

357
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
better be Hu Linen.

358
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,960
Air flows freely through it
and it’s damp-proof.

359
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,830
But the texture and pattern are not ideal.

360
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
So Xinsilu

361
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,110
will not use that kind of materials.

362
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,240
Why did you ask me to be here?

363
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,590
It’s not perfect but I don’t want
to throw it away.

364
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,640
I put a lot of dry chrysanthemums in here.

365
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,240
You get angry all the time,

366
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,880
they can help you to calm down.

367
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,160
I also put roots of kudzu vine.

368
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,140
= Pillow Design =

369
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,960
Master, are we making pillows, too?

370
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,110
Of course.

371
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,070
I thought

372
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,030
even if their floating pillows
are put into the market,

373
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,350
normal people like Elbow Zhang

374
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,830
will not be able to afford them.

375
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,680
Unless we make a cheaper version
of substitutes.

376
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,510
Not only can the lower class

377
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,000
in the city afford them.

378
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,200
We can make more money as well.

379
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
It’s a good idea.

380
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,310
But, we don’t have any experience.

381
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,880
How?

382
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,400
That’s why I got the design drawing.

383
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,440
It’s pretty in detail.

384
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,590
People who specialized in this

385
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,000
can definitely learn about right.

386
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,590
We can try and make a batch.

387
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,400
Step by step.

388
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,920
But this is Xinsilu’s design.

389
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,030
Do we have to inform Master Li first?

390
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,240
That guy

391
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,550
always disappears

392
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,510
at the critical moment.

393
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,480
Never mind, we should tell him.

394
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,680
In case he freaks out again.

395
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,720
Master Long.

396
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,550
Miss Du.

397
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,400
Are you here for Qingliu?

398
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,270
He went to a councilor’s Mansion

399
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,200
for a meeting.

400
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,030
I’m just wandering around.

401
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,350
Is there anything I can help with?

402
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
Li Qingliu that pervert has been
weird lately.

403
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,110
Well, how about I find someone to ask?

404
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,440
I heard that there are so many shops

405
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,160
faking our designs right now.

406
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,510
That’s true.

407
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,790
How did you deal with them, then?

408
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,830
Now you’re wrong.

409
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,240
We are already used to this kind

410
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,310
of situations.

411
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,270
We’re the leader in this field,

412
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,480
this small incident

413
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,880
helps us look better than the rest.

414
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,920
That’s true.

415
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,030
You’re generous.

416
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,790
Why did you ask this?

417
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Just talking.

418
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,200
Go to work, I’m going now.

419
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,070
Long Aoyi.

420
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,480
Obviously you’re up to something.

421
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,590
See you, Second Master.

422
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,720
Take care.

423
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,160
Second Master.

424
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,550
Master.

425
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,480
The money for the silkworm raisers
are ready?

426
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,960
Ready.

427
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,400
Take these to Liu’s Cloth Store
in the Southern City.

428
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,400
Use the Hu Linen

429
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,200
= Pillow Design =
to make 5 samples first.

430
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,720
Tell them the money is on me.

431
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:39,880
Okay.

432
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,720
The fire of the Silk Store
has been long ago,

433
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,000
but they still have a curfew.

434
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,640
Seems like without
the approval of Master Li,

435
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,350
we can’t go out after 5 P.M.

436
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,310
The timing is so bad.

437
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,160
The samples are ready,

438
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,790
waiting for me to make decisions.

439
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,240
Fly a letter to Prince Zhao now.

440
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,400
The second tree towards the East.

441
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,000
That’s it.

442
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,790
It’s 9 P.M. already.

443
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,550
Is Prince Zhao reliable at all?

444
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,070
Li Qingliu has not only set a curfew

445
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,440
but also sealed the dog hole.

446
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,880
He’s a prince.

447
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Is it appropriate to ask him

448
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,110
to dig a hole for me?

449
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,510
What’s wrong?

450
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,350
Watch for a while,
I’m going to the toilet.

451
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
I can’t wait.

452
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,640
How about we go out
through the secret door?

453
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,310
No.

454
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,160
It’s too close to Li Qingliu’s room.

455
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,240
What should we do, then?

456
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,790
Is it the guard

457
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,070
who just walked by?

458
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,640
How many times has he walked by?

459
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
Who is it?

460
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,590
Master.

461
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,510
Don’t move.

462
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,550
Are you being lazy again?

463
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,310
I’m not,

464
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,350
Shut up.

465
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,070
Turn left.

466
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,550
Stand here as punishment for an hour.

467
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,310
You’re so good.

468
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,510
You fooled that guy so well.

469
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Li Qingliu always

470
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,720
rambles on and on in front of me.

471
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,550
I’ve listened too much.

472
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,880
So I can intimate his tone about right,

473
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,000
maybe not exactly right.

474
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,240
Prince Zhao.

475
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,920
Miss Long.

476
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,510
What are you doing here?

477
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,350
I’m digging a hole.

478
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,510
It’s a little hard at the beginning.

479
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,110
Now,

480
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,160
I’m pretty good at it.

481
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,960
How did you guys get out?

482
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,000
I thought

483
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,880
we made a deal of digging the hole
in the back yard.

484
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,240
What are you doing in the front yard?

485
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,640
Let’s go. I’ll teach you

486
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,920
my way of digging a hole.

487
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,680
Lady.

488
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,880
Long Aoyi escaped

489
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,680
from here as I suspected.

490
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,640
Can’t imagine the dignified

491
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,790
Prince Zhao would be so ridiculous

492
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,640
for a girl

493
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,510
from the lower class.

494
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,030
Lady,

495
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
you asked me to dig into the Longzhu Gang.

496
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,480
There are some problems as you thought.

497
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,720
They are secretly

498
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
copying the floating pillows.

499
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,720
Do you think

500
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,480
that we should tell Master Li?

501
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
Long Aoyi copied his design.

502
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,350
We’re taking the upper hand.

503
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,240
If we want to win,

504
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,000
we have to be patient.

505
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,140
= Quay =

506
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,920
It’s not as smooth as the goatskin,

507
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,270
and is not complete enough.

508
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,640
But it feels nice.

509
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,240
We added lint on the goatskin
to be anti-skid.

510
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,510
With the lint,

511
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,920
the texture is better, too.

512
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,400
Ours is lighter than the goatskin one.

513
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,720
That means...

514
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,350
Of course it means

515
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,880
we did it!

516
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,790
Wonderful!

517
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,960
We did it! We did it!

518
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,480
Master, we made it.

519
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:46,920
Second Master.

520
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,790
Bring us the liquor.

521
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,270
Alright.

522
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:49,790
Please.

523
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:50,880
Let’s drink.

524
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
The liquor is here.

525
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,000
You’ve helped me a lot.

526
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,070
This time, too.

527
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,240
This is the Brotherhood Liquor
of Longzhu Gang.

528
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,400
Only for our best buds.

529
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,960
Prince Zhao,

530
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
after this drink,

531
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,960
you’d become the closest

532
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,720
brother of our Gang.

533
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,030
Here, cheers.

534
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,790
Cheers.

535
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,550
- Come on.
- Cheers.

536
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,750
Cheers.

537
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,160
Here.

538
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,380
= Wuyun Pavilion =

539
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,240
Everyone please be quiet.

540
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,480
Listen to me.

541
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,240
Today is the first

542
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,200
free open day of Wuyun Pavilion

543
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,440
since it opened.

544
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,000
The minimum charge used to be 10 coins.

545
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,920
Today, everything is free.

546
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,550
Cool.

547
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,310
Really?

548
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,310
They say that we have free shows
to watch today.

549
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,310
Is it true or not?

550
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,030
- Yeah.
- Is it?

551
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,960
If it’s not true, I’ll be going home

552
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,240
to take a nap in the middle of the day.

553
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,030
Yeah.

554
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,510
The show today would be brilliant.

555
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,480
It’s called The Beauty’s Dream.

556
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,960
The name is not bad.

557
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,160
I guarantee that you’ll

558
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,270
not get bored,

559
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,790
you’ll all be excited.

560
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,550
Here.

561
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,960
Well, that one is pretty.

562
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,750
This is pretty, too.

563
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,510
Well...

564
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,510
That one is beautiful.

565
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,640
Chief.

566
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,440
The capital sum from Master Long

567
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,590
is fifty-three thousand.

568
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,060
With interest added.

569
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,160
= Eighty-five thousand and nine hundred =
Nearly ninety thousand.

570
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,750
It’s not a small amount.

571
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,880
We just gave it to her like this?

572
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,920
Just do it.

573
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:21,750
Wait!

574
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,000
With one more year’s interest.

575
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,960
Add one year?

576
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,070
OK.

577
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,350
That one is the best.

578
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,380
Let’s go.

579
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,830
I suggest you watching our show

580
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,350
in distance,

581
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,920
don’t get too close.

582
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,640
I thought your performance was
to sell things.

583
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,550
How much does it cost to touch hands?

584
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,750
I’m selling goods today,

585
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,830
but I’m not selling the girls.

586
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,830
I’m selling the Float Float Pillows

587
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,750
under their heads.

588
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,830
Selling goods?

589
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,510
Brothel doesn’t sell girls,

590
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,960
but starts to sell pillows.

591
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,030
Are you kidding me?

592
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,640
Right.

593
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,510
You’re wrong, friend.

594
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,720
Our pillow is

595
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,510
of good quality with a decent price.

596
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,270
We used linen outside,
and cattail wool inside.

597
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,440
Totally different from

598
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,720
the usual hard pillows you guys use,

599
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,680
it offers you a feeling

600
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,230
of sleeping in the clouds.

601
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,400
More importantly,

602
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,150
it’s easy to carry with.

603
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,840
In daily life, when we go out to work,

604
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we get tired and run down,

605
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,840
we can just lean on it and
take a good nap.

606
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,800
When you wake up,

607
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,000
you can continue the good work.

608
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,960
Master Long,

609
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,590
how much is it?

610
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,230
A thousand copper coins.

611
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,150
It’s super cheap.

612
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,360
A lousy fabric

613
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,070
costs us half of a month’s meal expenses.

614
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,550
Now you’re wrong.

615
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,400
Do you know Xinsilu from the upper class?

616
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,880
Their goods are extremely expensive.

617
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,920
They are designing a similar style

618
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,800
of pillow, too.

619
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,760
But the price is 10 times higher.

620
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,070
Isn’t mine a good bargain or not?

621
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,280
We don’t care if it’s a good bargain.

622
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,960
We can live

623
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,190
without the pillow but not food.

624
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,110
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

625
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,440
Want us to spend money here.

626
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,150
- We’d rather go back to work.
- Let’s go.

627
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,070
Don’t leave.

628
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,880
What about the dance?
They are dancing.

629
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,840
What are you laughing about?
If you don’t buy things, just go.

630
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,150
- Rogues! Only interested in the girls.
- Don’t

631
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,400
touch the girls,

632
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,710
Don’t blame me for not helping you.

633
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,920
After all of these troubles,
people are all gone.

634
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,190
My throat is hurting.

635
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,320
Let me drink some tea.

636
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay, okay.

637
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,800
Master, I’ve looked around.

638
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,320
Didn’t find anyone, Qin’er, either.

639
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,440
Maybe they’re out.

640
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,400
I said nobody gets out

641
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,630
without my permission.

642
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,280
You said it’s after 5 P.M.

643
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,190
And,

644
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,400
if you’re worried about the fire

645
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,360
was aiming at Master Long,

646
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,070
you should apply the rules

647
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,670
to Master Long only.

648
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,670
So...

649
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,480
Go and find them.

650
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,310
Stop the nonsense.

651
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,150
Master, don’t be mad.

652
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,510
Isn’t it weird?

653
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,920
You paid her money back,

654
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,070
aren’t you afraid of her taking the money?

655
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,280
Shut up.

656
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,440
Qingliu.

657
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,070
Miss Du.

658
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,630
What are you talking about?

659
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,110
Who’s going to where?

660
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,440
Nothing.

661
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,150
A few days ago,

662
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,880
I planned to purchase some horses.

663
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,480
I heard

664
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,110
there’s a fine batch of Hequ Horse

665
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,960
that are coming in town.

666
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,320
Follow me to go and see.

667
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,150
OK.

668
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,530
Isn’t he Elbow Zhang?

669
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,220
- What’s he doing here?
- He’s been losing sleep for years.

670
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,140
How come he’s sleeping here?

671
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,480
And he sleeps so soundly.

672
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,190
Guys, isn’t it a good bargain or not?

673
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,110
It’s not my call.

674
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,280
It’s not your call.

675
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,400
Only those who have tried can comment.

676
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,150
I never

677
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,550
exaggerate things.

678
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,400
Right?

679
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:50,800
Right.

680
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,840
Everybody, look at him sleeping so well.

681
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,550
Look at him enjoying his dream.

682
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,440
He’s snoring so loud.

683
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,070
And he looks peaceful.

684
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,440
Exactly, you’re right.

685
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,710
This is Elbow Zhang
who always loses sleep.

686
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,880
He has trouble going to sleep.

687
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,480
He sells pork elbow from dust to dawn.

688
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,630
No doctor can help him

689
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,030
find the true cause.

690
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,840
But he’s sleeping well right now.

691
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,590
Why?

692
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,000
Thanks to the pillow

693
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,510
under his head.

694
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,320
I can’t sleep at night
from one day’s work, either.

695
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,960
Maybe I can try, too.

696
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,550
Yeah, go ahead and try.

697
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,590
I promise that

698
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
all the pillows we sell today

699
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,760
won’t be charged
in the three days of trial.

700
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,510
- Free?
- That’s cool.

701
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,960
Yan Bin.

702
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,920
There’s a short cut
near the Wuyun Pavilion.

703
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,320
Let’s walk there.

704
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,230
OK.

705
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,510
I came to the Silver City

706
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,550
not for long.

707
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,800
But while following Miss Long,

708
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,800
I’ve seen people’s attitudes toward life.

709
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,590
You guys have created many good stuffs

710
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,550
with wisdom.

711
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,710
Like the restaurants around the street.

712
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,320
Delicious.

713
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,630
The New Year pictures
on each family’s doors.

714
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,510
Good luck.

715
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,800
And the night markets in big bazar.
Prosperous.

716
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:28,760
Yes.

717
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,710
We have some family fun of our own, too.

718
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,960
Like when we go to bed,

719
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,480
we have to spend some quality time

720
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,440
with our wives, right?

721
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,150
Right?

722
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,800
Right.

723
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,030
You two are a good match, a fine couple.

724
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,840
A heaven-made match.

725
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,550
Though you’re correct.

726
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,590
I think the pillow is not in big size,

727
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,800
can it hold two people?

728
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,630
Yeah, can it?

729
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,470
Well.

730
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,400
Why don’t you come and try?

731
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,670
Yeah, try it.

732
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,880
Sleep on it to show us.

733
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,030
Sleep on it, sleep on it.

734
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,280
Are you looking for trouble?

735
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,840
Well.

736
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,630
If you buy a pillow today,

737
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
and two people can’t share one,

738
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,070
I’ll refund you twice the price.

739
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,760
Whether it can or not,

740
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,440
try it so that everyone knows.

741
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,760
What do you say?

742
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,960
Yeah. Go ahead, go ahead.

743
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,800
Try it, try it.

744
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,510
What are you talking about?

745
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,550
See, see.

746
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,880
- Try it.
- Try it.

747
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,550
- Hurry.
- I think

748
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,490
- Sleep on it.
- Sleep on it.

749
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,800
that they’re tricking us,

750
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,630
I’ll ask Wu Lin to take them away.

751
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,510
Well, it’s just sleeping on it,
I’ll do it.

752
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,230
We are friends, let’s do it.

753
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,070
Well, then,

754
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,150
