Master,

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,300
I have searched the whole city.

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,700
But can’t find Long Aoyi.

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,340
Frankly,

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,700
I love you.

37
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,620
I’m kidding!

Our outlets for collection of silkworms

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,260
have been occupied
by Second Master Lyu of Longzhu Gang

42
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,740
Our men didn’t dare to fight back.

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,740
Are you all cowards?

44
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,300
Get them back for me.

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,820
We have lost the gamble.

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,980
Our men are all frustrated

47
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,140
and feel humiliated.

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,060
A full pack of rubbishes!

49
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,100
What is the use of you?

50
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,700
Get rid of those guys from Longzhu Gang.

51
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,780
Otherwise, you will all be punished!

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,900
Interesting, really interesting!

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,060
Back to your business!

54
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,100
Lower your profile.

55
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,540
Ms. Long

56
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,660
is the new master of Longzhu Gang.

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,580
How about that toy boy?

58
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,540
The man named Li Qingliu today

59
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,380
is an influential guy.

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,860
He is the master of Xinsilu Silk Store,

61
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,860
the best store in Silver City.

62
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,620
He is an expert in doing business.

63
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,580
He is not only head of the richest
silk store in Silver City,

64
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,620
but also a handsome guy.

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,140
All girls in the city want to marry him.

66
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,340
But…

67
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,380
It is said he isn’t interested in girls.

68
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,540
Why is that?

69
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,780
It is said

70
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,140
he will get dizzy

71
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,700
when he is close to a girl.

72
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,780
That is really very strange.

73
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,540
Check Master Long more.

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,180
I didn’t expect we could have a girl

75
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,460
as the gang master in our state.

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,700
It’s much funnier than the richest guy.

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,660
Don’t you think so?

78
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,380
How about her parents?

79
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,260
Your Highness.

80
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,220
I didn’t find anything about her parents.

81
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,260
But she has a master

82
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,300
who lives with her at Wuyun Pavilion.

83
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,460
Wuyun Pavilion. What is it?

84
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,620
Wuyun Pavilion is the place

85
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,900
that Your Highness most prefer to visit.

86
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,660
The place that I most prefer to visit?

87
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,800
= Wuyun Pavilion =
- Come on and have fun. - Serve them well.

Coming.

89
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,010

Mr. Xu of Tongquli tipped
twenty taels of silver!

93

Manager Sun of Jiyuan Chamber
of Commerce of Luoyang

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,220
redeemed Ms. Jianan
with 500 taels of silver!

95
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,980
Master, you have slept since returned.

96
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,980
Have you sobered up?

97
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,580
Comfortable!

98
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,100
I must at least frustrate them

99
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,820
however lazy I may be.

100
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,380
Master.

101
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,020
A message from the quay says
the gold threads have arrived.

102
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,580
They will be released tomorrow.

103
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,260
Take them back immediately after that.

104
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,140
Never make a mistake.

105
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:46,980
Yes.

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,340
= Quay =

107
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,260
There’re the gold threads provided
by Quanzhou to honor Xinsilu.

108
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,980
You must keep them in proper custody.

109
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,700
Yes.

110
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,540
Master, the gold threads have arrived.

111
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,780
= Xinsilu =

112
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,620
Master, gold threads.

113
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,860
What? What is wrong?

114
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,700
I don’t know.

115
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,770
Go.

116
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,660
The raw materials are worth
90,000 taels of silver.

117
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,420
The license from the Department
of Supervision is worth 50,000.

118
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,740
Gold-thread clothes ordered from Persia

119
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,220
has a total contract value
of 3,000,000 taels.

120
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,380
A delay of work by one day
in the five-month schedule will

121
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,860
result in cost reduction until
twenty percent of total project value.

122
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,460
The total cost is 768,000 taels.

123
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,300
Shall we place an emergency order?

124
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,460
Garments are made in five months.

125
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,860
The lost gold threads were made
after the Double Nine Festival last year.

126
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,700
We can’t catch up with the schedule
however hard we may try.

127
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,180
When we got the gold threads,

128
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,100
both the copper lock and the box
were intact.

129
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,260
The gold threads will never disappear.

130
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,340
Qingliu, I will ask for my father’s help.

131
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,860
I will ask him to search the whole city

132
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,940
and check all inbound

133
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,220
and outbound people more strictly.

134
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,980
No thief will place eyes on the threads

135
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,060
in a net weight of not over three taels.

136
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,380
Transport them out secretly

137
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,860
and find a buyer who knows the value.

138
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,540
The closest trading place is Chang’an.

139
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,940
But it is too risky.

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,500
So selling the stolen goods on site
is the best strategy.

141
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,820
Reporting to the government now will only

142
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,740
urge them to hide the gold threads better.

143
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,780
Yan Bin,

144
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,980
start making investigations now.

145
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,500
From Quanzhou to the transit station,

146
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,420
the gold threats were personally escorted
by ninth-grade officials.

147
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,940
So the time when the gold threats
were most likely to be stolen

148
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,660
is the two hours of waiting for release

149
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,310
after arrival at the quay.

150
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,740
Xiaoxian, contact with
the Persian merchant now to see

151
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,820
if the delivery date can be delayed.

152
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,540
Master, we have also found another clue.

153
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,500
This rag was found

154
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,100
on the big cloth box

155
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,180
containing gold threads in the field.

156
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,900
We have verified it.

157
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,820
It doesn’t belong to any escorts
or any of our people.

158
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,420
It must be a torn part

159
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,240
of the clothes

160
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,300
from the thief of gold threads.

161
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,060
He isn’t tall.

162
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,460
But it is an inner shirt

163
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,100
The warp runs through from top to bottom.

164
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,780
It is so rough,

165
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,620
a typical way of the lower class.

166
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,540
Prepare the carriage.

167
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,220
I will visit the Ma’s Workshop
in Southern City.

= Clothes Shop =

169
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,020
Nice to see you, Master Li!

170
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,260
Please check the fabric carefully.

171
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,140
It is our product.

172
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,700
One warp to three wefts.

173
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,380
Whose clothes is made of this fabric?

174
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,180
I am not sure.

175
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,100
Look at the color.

176
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,780
It seems to be Wu …

177
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,700
Wuyun, Wuyun House?

178
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,680
No! No!

179
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,420
What? Wuyun …

180
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,500
Wuyun Pavilion!

181
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,300
Wuyun Pavilion?

182
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
That is a whorehouse!

183
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Wuyun Pavilion’s

184
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,140
head…

185
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,180
Wuyun Pavilion’s head showgirl! Let’s go!

186
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,140
No… Their master!

187
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,180
Master.

188
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,820
How about I going directly
to Wuyun Pavilion

189
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,780
and taking that head showgirl here?

190
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,140
It is a messy place.

191
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,260
I am afraid we may just get lost here.

192
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,900
They won’t dare

193
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,780
to trade in cash publicly.

194
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,380
Go ask around

195
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,140
where the lower class trades.

196
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,220
I will meet this head showgirl
at Wuyun Pavilion.

197
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,060
No, but it is a whorehouse actually.

198
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,020
Master,

199
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,260
you will certainly be the head showgirl

200
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,900
at Wuyun Pavilion with your figure.

201
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Are you going out?

202
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,820
They will tell the story about
Night Travel of Wenjun today.

203
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,740
Wasn’t it told at the previous episode?

204
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,340
It should be different this time.

205
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,100
The storyteller is Gengzi today.

206
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,860
Okay, just go.

207
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,380
Tell me again when you are back.

208
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,820
Only a silly girl

209
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,220
or a bad boy

210
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,380
will have an elopement.

211
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,660
By the way.

212
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,180
I am leaving. Don’t use my scraper.

213

Don’t worry.

on your door.

Silly girl, put it down!

Don’t misguide others.

Why are you back here again?

Xiaoqin, what are you doing?

OK. I see.

It is just a visit to the black market.

Don’t dress up in a high profile.

I am working for master, anyway.

I just passed by here.

You should also

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,020
be serving your girl master, right?

264
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Can you tell me

265
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,500
where one can sell

In what way do you think
Southern City is dirty?

269

Please mind your words.

270
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,820
You have no right to inquire about my

271
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,140
identity simply because you helped me.

272
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,180
I could certainly have dealt with

273

They are just silly guys.

275
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,940
They don’t deserve

276

your fighting at all.

277
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,820
Right?

You really have a glib tongue.

and I was attracted.

You look handsome

Well.

I am looking for your head showgirl.

Head showgirl?

300
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,580
I am the head showgirl.

301
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,820
But it was ten years ago.

302

You are looking for the head showgirl?

303

All our girls at Wuyun Pavilion
are head showgirls.

304
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,980
I am afraid you don’t have enough money.

305
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,180
Take care. It is fire.

306

Feng, he is Master Li,
the richest guy in Silver City.

Coming.

311
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,130
We are coming.

Do you know him?

handsome and rich.

317

He is just an arrogant womanizer.

I didn’t expect he would
come to Southern City for fun.

What an abnormal person!

320

Stay away from me!

321
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
Step aside!

322
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,020
What’s wrong with you?

323
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,860
- Don’t offend our master.

What kind of girl do you prefer?

00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,060
She’s a girl who sells neither sex or art,

338
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,380
nor even flatter the guest.

339
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,620
Call her here.

340
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,820
Master Li,

341
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,660
I can invite

342
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,220
whoever you prefer today

343
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,820
except her.

344
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Master, Li, I have taken her here.

345
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,460
Just have a good talk.

346
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,020
It is you!

347
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,900
You’ve done with your tricks?

348
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Now come to Wuyun Pavilion to pick girls?

349
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,660
You are the head showgirl here?

350
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,260
Don’t hurt me secretly.

351
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,380
Secretly?

352
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,620
There is a big signboard over the door.

353
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,660
Can’t you read it out yourself?

354
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,100
That is Xiaoqin…

355
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,900
Forget it, it is no use blabbering here.

356
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,300
No wonder you said yesterday

357
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,180
you got up early and went to bed late.

358
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,300
I didn’t expect you were just a whore.

359
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,060
I was almost touched by your banana oils.

360
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,220
I hate dudes like you.

361
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,860
Don’t think you can flaunt yourself

362
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,180
before me with your money.

363
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,580
Should I play submissive

364
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,580
to you like them and

365
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,900
respond to your cold words with smiles?

366
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,700
Should I flatter you

367
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,660
and call you honey despite your sneers?

368
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,740
Enough? It is my turn now.

369
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,340
Where are my gold threads?

370
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,180
How can I know
where the gold threads are?

371
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,100
I have evidence from the site of theft.

372
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,260
As head showgirl of Wuyun Pavilion,

373
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,980
do you expect to deny and cover it up?

374
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,100
You must explain it clearly.

375
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,660
I have never done anything illegal.

376
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,500
Although it is hard to feed a girl,

377
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,100
you shouldn’t have stolen things.

378
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,260
Feng, they have progressed really fast.

379
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,780
You must pay me triple the cost
if you damage any property here!

380
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,140
I have never quarreled with a girl.

381
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Don’t push me to the corner.

382
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,620
Give me back the gold threads.

383
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,700
Do your own business.

384
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,340
We shouldn’t interfere with each other.

385
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,580
All the clues are directed to you.

386
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,540
Don’t deny it.

387
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,940
Sisters, help me!

388
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,500
- Release her. Let go. Come down.
- What are you doing publicly?

389
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,700
What a lech you are!

390
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,380
How dare you force a girl like this!

391
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,980
Girls, catch and deliver him
to the government.

392
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,740
Did he hurt you?

393
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,300
How are you wounded?

394
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,820
Don’t think you can do whatever you like

395
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,380
because you are the richest man
in Silver City.

396
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,380
Everybody

397
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,300
must obey

398
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,220
the rules here.

399
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,900
Is she your head showgirl here?

400
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,540
It is a shame on your name.

401
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,780
She is just a thief.

402
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,180
Nonsense!

403
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,100
Who is a thief?

404
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,260
I definitely saw you

405
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,900
coming out of her room!

406
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,020
He entered my room?

407
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,740
Yeah.

408
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,620
When I saw him,

409
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,020
he was coming out of your room.

410
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,660
It is yours?

411
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,900
You even peeped at me bathing!

412
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,860
What an abnormal person you are!

413
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,780
I saw nothing.

414
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,740
What do you expect to see?

415
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Seize him!

416
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,940
Come down. Don’t go away. Stop!

417
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,140
= Du’s Mansion =

418
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,420
Xiaoxian, it isn’t a sign of good luck

419
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,500
to dress up in white
when the royal family comes.

420
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,780
Change a red one.

421
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,830
Father,

422
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,140
I don’t like to dress up in colors

423
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,940
to attend an official feast with you.

424
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,740
I am your daughter, not an entertainer.

425
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,660
Xiaoxian,

426
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,180
I can read your mind well.

427
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,060
Your beloved man

428
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,260
doesn’t appreciate others’ favors.

429
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,380
Although I am a powerful commissioner,

430
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,980
I still need the support of royal forces.

431
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,260
It is good timing now
to win over His Highness!

432
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,740
Just do me a favor.

433
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,300
OK, I will change my clothes.

434
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,580
I wonder if you know the silk store

435
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,660
had something valuable stolen.

436
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,500
It’s the raw material
of gold-thread clothes.

437
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,340
It was stolen during inspection
at the quay last night.

438
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,900
Do formal business first.

439
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,980
His Highness is waiting for you now.

440
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,940
Father!

441
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,860
Enough.
I still have official affairs to do.

442
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,900
Don’t talk to anybody

443
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,740
about what happened on Wuyun Pavilion.

444
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,700
Guess who I encountered

445
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,980
when I was inquiring about
the trading place of the lower class.

446
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,060
Her servant girl!

447
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,900
I got some secrets from her.

448
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,060
Were you bullied?

449
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,470
No...

450
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,550
That is impossible.

451
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,900
I

452
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,780
got some important clues

453
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,300
from Xiaoqin.

454
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,780
The lower class

455
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,220
prefers to sell illegal valuables

456
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,060
at the black market.

457
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,740
Black market? I have heard about it.

458
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,740
It is frequented by the low people only.

459
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,780
Exactly, the illegal articles
are sold on site.

460
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,100
It is the best place indeed.

461
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,500
Let’s go there tomorrow.

462
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Your Highness, try this
Globefish with Vinegar.

463
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,580
Years ago,

464
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,820
our first emperor highly praised it

465
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,340
after tasting it in Silver City.

466
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,380
Silver City is located in Sichuan.

467
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,820
Its economy has developed robustly

468
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,580
in recent years.

469
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,140
But its tax contributions
to the capital city

470
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,580
have been on the decline these years.

471
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,660
Why?

472
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,460
Your Highness,

473
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,820
such a decline in tax contribution is

474
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,380
due to stronger resistance
from the lower class

475
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,220
and the tax evasion practices

476
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,460
of some big merchants.

477
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,120
Well…

478
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,140
Why don’t you deal with it then?

479
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,540
I am afraid excessive suppression will

480
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,420
affect people’s livelihood
and stability of our state.

481
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,900
Do you have any suggestions?

482
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,140
I think

483
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,260
we should shoot the early bird.

484
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,820
Crack down upon the big merchants

485
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,940
as a menace to others.

486
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,580
We can punish the lower class

487
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,580
according to our state laws.

488
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,420
In this way, Your Highness…

489
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,300
These days, I have deeply felt

490
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,780
the prosperity of Silver City,

491
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,020
particularly Southern City.

492
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,420
It has good social orders despite

493
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,380
the local preferences for martial arts.

494
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,340
It is said you have a female gang leader.

495
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,580
The lower-class people are unruly.

496
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,580
They don’t deserve Your Highness’ care.

497
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,980
My daughter Du Xiaoxian
is a manager of Xinsilu,

498
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,180
the best silk store of Silver City.

499
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,830
If Your Highness wants

500
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,940
to personally know about public opinions,

501
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,900
my daughter can show you around.

502
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,670
A good father breeds a good daughter.

503
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,380
Although your daughter
was born with a silver spoon in mouth,

504
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,380
she has her ambitions.

505
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,780
I really appreciate that.

506
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Thanks for your compliment, Your Highness.

507
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,260
Your Highness, this is the most prosperous
marketplace of Silver City.

508
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,380
It looks very special and unique.

509
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,140
It is lovely.

510
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,660
Your Highness.

511
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,020
The pastry is the most delicious here.

512
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,780
You can have a try, Your Highness.

513
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,620
Good.

514
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,900
Wu Lin,

515
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,460
= Longxiang Bakery =
Remember to buy some pastry here before we leave.

516
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:48,980
Yes.

517
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,540
Ms. Du, do you know

518
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,220
a place called big bazar in the city?

519
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,180
It is a place of the lower class
in the south.

520
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,780
The big bazar has
an enormous gathering of the lower class.

521
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,620
We seldom go there.

522
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,260
It is not recommended to go.

523
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,100
Flowery umbrella!

524
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,340
Thanks for your advice, Ms. Du.

525
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,620
I think of something.

526
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,340
Wu Lin, escort Ms. Du back home.

527
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,140
- Yes.
- I will leave first then.

528
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,560
Great!

529
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,760
Great!

530
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,000
Great!

531
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,380
Where on earth is the auction?

532
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,260
Nobody knows it.

533
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,060
Look for it again.

534
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,900
Great, great!

535
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,180
Master Long hasn’t shown up here

536
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,380
since opening of the black market.

537
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,980
It is so great

538
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,220
to see Master Long here today.

539
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,020
Yes, Master Long.

540
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,240
I am coming to get a rare article

541
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,860
at the request of my master.

542
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,780
Master Long,

543
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,140
you can take away

544
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,300
whatever you like at a low price here.

545
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,420
Yes, we will never increase the price.

546
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,900
Come on, a toast for you.

547
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,740
Thanks then.

548
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,450
Cone on.

549
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,700
Master, master, look.

550
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,340
It is that abnormal guy again.

551
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,420
He peeped at you bathing last time

552
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,060
and is here at the black market now.

553
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,540
Have you become his target?

554
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,980
I didn’t expect the rumor was true.

555
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,220
Considering his look,

556
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,420
he deserves your love, Master Long.

557
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,420
What are you talking about?

558
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,620
Bad luck indeed. Let’s go.

559
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
Master.

560
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,020
- Are you leaving?
- Go.

561
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,660
Master Long, please wait.

562
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,180
Go away!

563
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,860
Just walk your own way.

564
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,300
Get out of my way here.

565
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,020
Do you think you can defeat me easily?

566
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,300
Master Long.

567
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,060
Whoever you are,

568
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,380
it is great
to see an old acquaintance today.

569
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,980
Can you please tell me

570
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,380
how to get to the auction?

571
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,060
You are really a brazen person.

572
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,700
You can’t even stop your glib tongue
when you ask for ways.

573
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,660
Why don’t you hang up the fish today?

574
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,540
It seems that peeping at a girl bathing

575
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,060
is a piece of cake for you.

576
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,140
It is just a misunderstanding that day.

577
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,380
I hope you won’t mind it.

578
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,220
Please accept it

579
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
as a token of forgiveness.

580
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,460
It is such a low gift.

581
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,670
Well.

582
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,780
I have no change
for such a big teal of silver.

583
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,180
How about a barter trade?

584
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,300
I like this one.

585
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,580
Follow up.

586
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,070
Follow up!

587
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:37,780
Go.

588
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,340
Master, why did you let her go?

589
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,180
Follow up first.

590
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,060
Want to gloss it over with a low gift?

591
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,860
Well.

592
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,660
Don’t be too proud because of money.

593
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,620
Master.

594
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,580
Too many people. We lost her.

595
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,980
It was a tongue depressor

596
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,740
in the mouth of a dead person.

597
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,900
I knew they won’t behave themselves.

598
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,020
So I already

599
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,820
pasted some silk glands of noctuid on it.

600
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,380
They will become inconspicuous fine

601
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,620
threads and sag when it’s windy.

602
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,470
Alright.

603
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,420
Go.

604
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,620
Guard at the entrance.

605
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,380
Check if there are any forbidden goods,

606
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,140
particularly peppers.

607
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:56,900
Yes.

608
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,100
You look very strange. Who are you?

609
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,900
How can I be admitted?

610
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,820
You must have a reference
or a letter of guarantee.

611
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,500
We are coming for an auction.

612
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,940
Do you still need a letter of guarantee
from a payer?

613
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,420
Everyone must obey the rules at big bazar.

614
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,900
No access for strangers
without a letter of guarantee.

615
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,140
We know that person.

616
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,620
Master Long?

617
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,220
OK, just take a seat.

618
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,140
Next, I declare

619
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,980
the auction starts now.

620
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,860
Look.

621
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,180
They found the entrance.

622
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,580
That abnormal guy is quite smart.

623
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,180
Most commodities for auction today

624
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,220
will be sold to the highest bidder.

625
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,420
After I declare the starting price,

626
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,900
if you are interested,

627
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,020
please raise your hand to offer a bid.

628
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,300
With multiple bids,

629
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,780
- the highest bidder will win it.
- What a profiteer!

630
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,860
Let’s start it now.

631
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,020
Next, I will declare the first collection

632
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,620
for this auction.

633
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,780
Please check here.

634
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,010
- Bro.
- Check them all.

635
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,250
Look.

636
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,860
What is the last commodity for today?

637
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,030
- Look carefully.
- Forget him.

638
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,980
- Let’s wait for the last article.
- Start bidding now.

639
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,840
150 teals.

640
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,530
Okay, 150 taels for this gentleman.

641
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,120
- Master, I have asked around.
- 200.

642
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,340
Okay, 200 for the first time.

643
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,780
The box wrapped up in a linen bag

644
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,580
- is the last article.
- 280.

645
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,980
It contains gold threads inside.

646
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,740
- I will get it right away.
- Okay, 280.

647
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,900
Wait!

648
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,580
- They put the gold threads for auction
- 280 the first time

649
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,690
- 280 for the second time
- at the black market just to get money.

650
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,370
There are different types of people here.

651
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,690
- It is easy
- 280 for the third time.

652
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,040
- to alert our target.
- It’s sold!

653
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,770
OK.

654
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,460
Congratulations, friend.

655
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,440
You got the first one.

656
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,440
Everybody.

657
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,560
Silence, please.

658
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,400
Now,

659
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,380
- Snake Gang. Snake Gang.
- let’s see

660
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,390
the second article for auction today.

661
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,020
Bro, emergency rescue.

662
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,690
Take others’ properties at good faith.

663
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,420
What a coincidence!

664
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,020
Thanks for rescuing me.

665
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,700
May I know your name?

666
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,700
I am Zhao Hongjin.

667
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,420
I am from Chang’an.

668
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,940
Zhao.

669
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:52,920
I am…

670
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,610
Long Aoyi,

671
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,380
master of the biggest gang in Silver City.

672
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,460
You are a heroine who protects
the livelihood of silkworm farmers,

673
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,940
punishes the evil and helps the good.

674
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,740
I really appreciate that.

675
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,660
How did you know about me?

676
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,620
The gamble at Wanhua

677
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,460
was really so impressive to me.

678
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,580
Thanks.

679
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,540
OK, now I will declare

680
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,900
the next collection.

681
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,980

is a property of Mrs. Xian
of the Liang Dynasty who is honored

683
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,010
as the No. 1 female general of China.

684
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,570
It has excellent and rare craftsmanship.

685
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,880
The starting price is 500 taels of silver.

686
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,430

600 from this bidder.

688

This bidder offers 800 taels.

691
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,020
How about I buying this crown for you?

692
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,890

- This bidder offers 1,000.

696
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,140
of the late dynasty fits you well.

697
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,140
1,000, any other offerings?

698
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,020
Well, I…

699

Your Highness!

700
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,900
I smell peppers.

701
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,060
Go.

702
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,780
Okay.

703
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,900
I have something urgent to handle.

704
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,600
I have to go first.

705
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,560
It is a very good opportunity.

706
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,030
This treasure

707
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,660
is a rare one.

708
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,100
You won’t see it again if you miss it.

709
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,680
Any other offerings?

710
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,120
Dear all, is there any other offerings?

711
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,700
He adores you.

712
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,610
What? I don’t know him.

713
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,500
1,500 taels.

714
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,460
OK.

715
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,900
1,500 taels.

716
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,010
2,000.

717
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:19,850
OK.

718
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,800
2,000.

719
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,840
2,000 for the first time.

720
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,420
2,000 for the second time.

721
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,950
2,000 for the third time.

722
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,420
Sold!

723
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,900
Thanks for your support.

724
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,180
We are coming to the final stage
of the spring auction.

725
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,950
The next commodity is very valuable.

726
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,880
Master, look, it is coming.

727
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,190
- It comes from the government secretly.
- Look.

728
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,020
To avoid arousing governmental attention,

729
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,140
we will receive bids without exposing it.

730
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,220
Open bids are accepted.

731
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,610
The highest bidder will win it.

732
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Let’s wait and see.

733
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,300
The auction starts!

734
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,830
It finally comes.

735
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,620
We are really inborn adversaries.

736
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
You bid for a small article

737
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
against me.

738
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,900
Okay, let’s play the game together.

739
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,380
You are really a mean person.

740
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,780
Are you going to bid up the price?

741
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,660
But don’t worry.

742
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,620
Nobody can take away my belongings.

743
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,940
No kidding.

744
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,100
How can you take it as your belongings?

745
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,220
How stupid is the richest guy
in Silver City!

746
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,820
Luck is really on your side

747
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,100
to have such a big business.

748
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,300
20!

749
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,460
40!

750
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,700
50!

751
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,660
Okay, 50 from Master Long.

752
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,500
I remind you kindly.

753
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,220
Don’t get unreasonable by anger.

754
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,540
It may not be what you need.

755
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,300
500 taels!

756
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,740
- 500!
- 500!

757
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,700
This bidder rises to 500 directly!

758
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,880
I didn’t expect that.

759
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,310
The offering today

760
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,580
was really out of my expectation.

761
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,060
If any problems,

762
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,420
I can double the price.

763
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,020
The price hiked by ten times.

764
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,820
Please offer your price, Master Long.

765
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,180
I certainly can’t defeat this profiteer
in fortune.

766
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,340
Tell me,

767
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,900
how did you escape

768
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,340
when you were besieged by our girls

769
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,620
at the whorehouse then?

770
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,580
Does it have anything to do with auction?

771
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,980
Why did you visit a whorehouse
when you abstained from a girl?

772
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,340
I think you have a girl’s mind

773
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,460
even if you have a man’s body.

774
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,140
Sir,

775
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,100
the bidder failed to offer a bid for long.

776
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,100
Can I win the bid automatically?

777
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,460
Sir.

778
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,860
We didn’t

779
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,420
agree on the interval of offering.

780
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,850
Master Long, please continue your bid.

781
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,220
1,000 taels!

782
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,670
1,000!

783
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,940
Master Long offers 1,000!

784
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,780
Master, we don’t have even 500 in hand.

785
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,980
Go back and get it.

786
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,260
It is not easy

787
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,340
to find something that my master likes.

788
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
It is just money.

789
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,900
I just hate

790
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,940
this canning and arrogant dude.

791
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,020
Let me remind you here.

792
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,940
Don’t argue with money.

793
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,340
You can’t afford to lose it.

794
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
5,000 taels!

795
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,580
Stay calm.

796
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,480
Stay calm.

797
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,980
Don’t be too arrogant.

798
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,780
5,001 taels!

799
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,060
10,000 taels!

800
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,400
10,000 taels!

801
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,480
10,000 taels!

802
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,970
Small money.

803
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,550
I have never seen so much money
in my life.

804
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,270
This bidder…

805
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,220
This bidder offers 10,000 taels!

806
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,660
10,000! It is 10,000!

807
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,300
Look at that.

808
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,750
- 10,000 for the first time.
- It’s a sunny day today!

809
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,800
- Good weather!
- It’s a sunny day today!

810
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,140
10,000 for the second time!

811
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,940
10,000 for the third time!

812
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,340
Sold!

813
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,830
10,000.

814
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,450
What?

815
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,300
May I take it away?

816
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,700
Money talks the loudest of all.

817
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,180
Yes.

818
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,460
Yes. Yes.

819
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,180
Sir, this way please.

820
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,460
= Two thousand Taels of Silver =

821
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:09,940
Master.

822
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,660
What are you doing here?

823
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,940
We came in from the backdoor

824
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,020
through special relations.

825
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,780
You have arrived just in time.

826
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,380
Escort the gold threads back.

827
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,180
Master, I found it.

828
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,860
This cloth is the uniform of Longzhu Gang.

829
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,620
It’s the girl who ruined
our gold-thread clothes at Wanhua

830
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,500
and fought with you at the whorehouse.

831
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,340
What?

832
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,300
Give it to me.

833
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,740
Check the fabric.

834
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,740
No wonder

835
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,540
she kept disturbing me on the way.

836
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,020
She even had a public bidding
for the gold threads with me just now.

837
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,260
She just expected to revenge me

838
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,660
for what had happened.

839
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,980
I got it.

840
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,140
Take it easy, Master.

841
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
