Thanks to the help of Qinglong Firm.

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,170
We’ve finished all of

35
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,490
the thirty Nyuertus.

36
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,730
Here’s a toast to all.

37
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,940
Thank you.

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,010
The liquor contains

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,360
my appreciations.

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,220
- Here.
- Drink it up.

Cheers.

42
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,810
- Drink up.
- Here, cheers.

43
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,050
Thank you, Master Li.

44
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,050
Its taste is tender and unique.

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,300
Nice.

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:16,900
Seems like we can’t

47
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,610
judge food from their looks, either.

48
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,510
Have some more.

49
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,940
Okay, okay.

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,700
Master Li has finally thought it through.

51
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,210
Eat more.

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,660
Xiaoqin finally knows

53
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,390
to take care of people, too.

54
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,470
It depends on the people.

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,730
Xiaoqin wouldn’t pick food

56
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,450
for people like us.

57
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,420
That’s not true.

58
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,420
I’ll do it now.

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,500
Just enjoy it.

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,730
Eat and stop talking.

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,060
Skinny.

62
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,760
I thought you would

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
never lose in quarreling.

64
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,230
Now seems like

65
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,400
Yan Bin is better at it.

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,760
He’s way better than you.

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,070
Of course.

68
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,040
I don’t have a partner to practice with.

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,350
I’m stuck with you every day.

70
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,870
But Yan Bin can

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,070
quarrel with Xiaoqin a lot.

72
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:00,990
Who quarrels a lot?

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,590
You’re wrong.

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,320
Xiaoqin and I don’t quarrel.

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,350
We’re just

76
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,590
talking every day.

77
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,230
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

78
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:27,590
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
People live their lives.

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
People get killed.

81
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
Kill you with four stabs.

82
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,030
Nice, Master.

83
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,470
Okay.

84
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,330
Next.

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
People live their lives.

86
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,430
People get killed.

87
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,280
Kill you with two stabs.

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,310
Kill you with one stab.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,680
Your turn.

90
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,050
I’ll drink up.

91
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,470
People live their lives.

92
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,470
People get killed.

93
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,640
Kill you with three stabs.

94
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,560
Drink.

95
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,360
Master Li, you’re weak.

96
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,520
Hurry.

97
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Slow down, no one is racing you.

98
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,520
What a pity.

99
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,200
Come on, come on.

100
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,550
Stop pouring for him.

101
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,670
He’s been talking nonsense.

102
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,830
Why can’t I pour liquor?

103
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,190
Master Long,

104
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,470
can you be less tomboy?

105
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,030
Why would I?

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,440
You’re not girlie enough.

107
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,220
Girlie?

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,310
Girlie?

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,590
Like Du Xiaoxian?

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,310
Not really.

111
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,070
At least you and I are good friends.

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,470
Du Xiaoxian is enough for your

113
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,350
definition of girlie.

114
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,400
I don’t need to be like that.

115
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,840
If she’s not girlie enough.

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,400
Welcome to Wuyun Pavilion,

117
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,120
meeting the girls there.

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,440
We have different kinds of girls.

119
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,030
I don’t mean that.

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
I get it.

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
One more drinks.

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,030
To all the things we’ve accomplished.

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,440
The lower class is no lack of business.

124
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,310
It’s no bigger than Xinsilu.

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
But we can definitely support ourselves.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Now our work of Nyuertu is done.

127
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,910
Qinglong Firm can...

128
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,760
can continue its work.

129
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,670
Sure. Come on.

130
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,990
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

131
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:12,720
It can dissolve.

132
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,680
Dissolve? Why?

133
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,720
People either

134
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,400
cooperate or dissolve.

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
I have nothing that you want.

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,030
You have nothing that I want.

137
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,630
It’d be a waste of time to stay together.

138
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,240
Are you crazy? Let it go.

139
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,510
If I let go

140
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,440
you’d run again.

141
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Let me go. People are watching.

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Let them be.

143
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
I want to let things out today.

144
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,710
I, Li Qingliu.

145
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,600
Won’t let you, Long Aoyi to leave me.

146
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,880
You only learned business with me
for a few days

147
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,310
and you’ve become so good at it.

148
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,440
Of course

149
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,510
I can’t let you go.

150
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,120
Let’s team up and

151
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
defeat all of our competitors

152
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,880
in the Silver City.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,750
Are you drunk?

154
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,190
You get so dramatic when you’re drunk.

155
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,560
Isn’t he?

156
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,600
- Yeah. Come on.
- Exactly.

157
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,750
Come on. I’ll drink until the end.

158
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,240
- Let’s drink.
- Come on.

159
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,480
That’s right.

160
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,830
Right?

161
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,830
Let’s drink more.

162
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,800
What do you think of Qinglong Firm?

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,310
Take Qing from your name,

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,440
and Long from mine.

165
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,480
Good name.

166
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,120
Okay, I promise you.

167
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,120
Qinglong Firm

168
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,880
will eliminate all the injustices

169
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,040
and profiteers. Here. Cheers.

170
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
Cheers.

171
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,710
Why do people drink?

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
It feels good.

173
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,270
How?

174
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,270
I’m having a headache.

175
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,000
That’s because you’re not drinking enough.

176
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,070
It says on the script

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,950
that you only get drunk when drinking

178
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,950
with the people you love.

179
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,680
Is that what you mean?

180
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,240
Walk steadily.

181
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,040
Why does he look so familiar?

182
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,310
That’s your master.

183
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,880
Okay. Stop. It’s here.

184
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,750
My, my master?

185
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,150
- Master. Master. Are you okay?
- Master.

186
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,880
Every time he’s drunk,

187
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,120
he’d sleep right away or get crazy.

188
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,270
I didn’t bully him.

189
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,830
He wouldn’t let me go.

190
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,480
He forced me to join him in the carriage.

191
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,240
Bring him back immediately.

192
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,920
Master Long, I think

193
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,560
the reason he didn’t let you go

194
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,950
is probably because

195
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,070
he, he wants...

196
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,270
He wants a third master.

197
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
Well, not really. I think...

198
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,440
Second Master hasn’t agreed to that.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,830
Who said about finding a third master?

200
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,680
Xiaoxian.

201
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,360
Xiaoxian.

202
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,630
What’s wrong with you, Qingliu?

203
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,750
It’s obvious he’s drunk.

204
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,000
I’m fine.

205
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,200
Yan Bin.

206
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,750
Hurry up and take him back.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,600
Yes.

208
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,390
I’m fine.

209
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,000
Go, go.

210
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,870
Be careful.

211
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,450
Be careful.

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,320
Miss Du, see you.

213
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,120
That woman is shameless.

214
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,360
What’s with the badgering?

215
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,270
Miss, you were too nice..

216
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,120
You should slap them.

217
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,670
If I do that,

218
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,030
what would Qingliu think of me?

219
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,270
He was already drunk like that.

220
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,630
Besides, according to the lord,

221
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,270
you’re going to Chang’an
tomorrow morning.

222
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,480
To check out the new mansion.

223
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,480
I think

224
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,630
he’s trying to separate you and
Master Li.

225
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,030
Master Li.

226
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,030
Are you okay? Let me take you to the bed.

227
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,750
Vomiting is good.

228
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,720
Vomiting is good.

229
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,550
Master Li, Master Li.

230
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,630
At this critical time,

231
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,510
do you really need to go to Chang’an?

232
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,320
You don’t understand.

233
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,430
This is very important.

234
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,270
I have to go personally.

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,510
Is there any preparation to do?

236
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,880
Nothing yet.

237
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,600
I’ve settled the things in the Gang.

238
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,050
Just stay here and see how things go.

239
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,600
Write me a letter if anything comes up.

240
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,120
Yes.

241
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,990
Master, a letter from the Du’s.

242
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,710
Miss Du asked you to open personally.

243
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,280
What happened?

244
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,230
Xiaoxian went to Chang’an.

245
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,920
I thought it’s something special.

246
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,160
Miss Du goes there for purchase a lot.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,960
This time is different.

248
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,970
She went with her father for his new job

249
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,470
So.

250
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,950
Is she coming back to the Silver City?

251
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,560
What about her business?

252
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,230
I’ll handle it.

253
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,320
Send someone to prepare a carriage
of first-class cloth

254
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,590
for Xiaoxian and send them to Chang’an.

255
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,320
Ask what else she needs.

256
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,400
Get it for her next time.

257
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,920
Go.

258
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,550
Yes.

259
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,440
Qingliu, I’m going to Chang’an.

260
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,920
I’ve got much to say

261
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,920
but don’t know where to start.

262
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,280
For all these years,

263
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,830
you and I have expanded Xinsilu together.

264
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,520
Though I’m a woman, I’m always
brave and energetic.

265
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,990
I’ll not abandon Xinsilu.

266
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,830
My trip with father

267
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,350
is to settle Du’s new mansion in Chang’an.

268
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,800
It’s also for my own purpose.

269
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,920
I know that you aim for the highest.

270
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,650
All these years,

271
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,770
you’ve been planning

272
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,770
to expand Xinsilu more.

273
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,060
So I’m hoping this trip

274
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,180
can help me to know about

275
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,490
the important councilors and royals
in the court.

276
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,730
Please wait for good news.

277
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,770
I’ll write again when I’m about to
come back.

Lord.

290
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,690
According to the head of Ministry
of Revenue, Mr. Pang,

291
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,140
someone handed a secret letter
to the court

292
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,140
to impeach you.

293
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,450
This letter tells a lot

294
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,690
about my bribery with the
merchant princes in the city.

295
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,970
It’s definitely from someone big.

296
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,380
Jinshan Silk Store, five million
and two hundred thousand taels.

297
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,180
Yinxian Silk Store, three million taels.

298
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,570
Well... My Lord.

299
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,810
It accused you of

300
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,020
privately receiving forty million taels.

301
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,300
If the Court of Censors find out,

302
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,930
they’ll confiscate your property
and exterminate your family.

303
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,730
Well...Well...

304
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,540
Don’t be panic.

305
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,500
Mr. Pang has stopped the letter.

306
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,260
Since he has told me that,

307
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,620
it means he wants to help.

308
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,970
Thanks to your

309
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,780
daily socializing with the councilors.

310
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,620
It has

311
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,730
finally paid off.

312
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,930
Mr. Pang has also asked me

313
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,090
to clean all the mess

314
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,380
before I take my new office.

315
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,210
Think about it,

316
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,810
who’d stab in my back?

317
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,300
Maybe someone against you in the court.

318
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,300
Can they even reach to the Silver City?

319
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
Stupid.

320
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,450
Think again.

321
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,140
With all the listed affairs in the letter.

322
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,260
Is it

323
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,090
an equity participant of Xinsilu?

324
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,850
Or

325
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,900
a Xinsilu’s competitor?

326
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,090
My Lord.

327
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,050
I’ll immediately find an excuse

328
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,260
to investigate and get rid of Li Qingliu.

329
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,180
No rush.

330
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,260
I’ve got my own way.

331
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,660
= Du’s Mansion =

332
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,300
Qingliu, check it out.

333
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,670
= Dispatch Li Qingliu to Jia’ermu
as merchant =

334
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,490
= For discussing Nyuertu
related issues between two countries =

335
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,230
= This is the state’s top issue
Please spare no effort =

336
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,820
= Ministry of Foreign Affairs =

337
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,420
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

338
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,690
I’m just a business man.

339
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,500
It’s way out of my league
to serve as an envoy.

340
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,970
It’s clear on the official document

341
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,300
that you don’t go

342
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,970
as a regular business man,

343
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,540
but as an envoy representing the court.

344
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,380
Besides,

345
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,900
Nyuertu is the product made by Xinsilu.

346
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,500
They’ll be delivered
to the princess of Jia’ermu.

347
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,180
You can clearly elaborate

348
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,780
the meaning of the design.

349
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,160
As long as you make it,

350
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
by the time you’re home,

351
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,440
you’ll get all the fame and support.

352
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,800
That’s very considerable of you.

353
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,750
Personally,

354
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,470
I’d like you to go, too.

355
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,830
If somebody else do it

356
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,230
and accidents happen during the trip,

357
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,470
let alone the Silver City,

358
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,280
the entire Jiannan Dao
can’t excuse itself.

359
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,980
And,

360
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,330
for all these years,

361
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,490
my family has treated you well.

362
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,490
Xiaoxian is my precious daughter,

363
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,380
and she gave up the stable life at home

364
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,090
but chose to work hard for Xinsilu.

365
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,620
I’ve never

366
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,860
commented on these things before.

367
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,700
Why did Xiaoxian go to Chang’an

368
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,010
all of a sudden?

369
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,490
I have to take my new office soon.

370
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,050
Xiaoxian set off early

371
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,330
for my sake.

372
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,180
Besides, she’s of marriageable age.

373
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,010
But she always delays getting married.

374
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,420
Well, I’ve heard

375
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,660
that there are many

376
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,140
outstanding men in Chang’an.

377
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,530
Maybe Xiaoxian

378
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,940
can meet someone she likes there.

379
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,090
Qingliu, do you really think so?

380
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,180
Xiaoxian has devoted too much
for the Silk Store,

381
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,620
if she can

382
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,290
meet someone during the trip.

383
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,570
I’ll surely prepare
lavish presents for her.

384
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,900
Of course,

385
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,660
it all depends on her personal will.

386
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,700
I’m so relieved

387
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,140
that you agree with me.

388
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,330
As for the trip to Jia’ermu...

389
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,010
Never mind. I’ll pick a day and set off.

390
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,090
Thank you, Master Li.

391
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,620
Take care.

392
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,660
It was a good idea.

393
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,660
First, if anything happens during

394
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,050
a merchant’s trip to other countries,

395
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,180
it won’t be as serious as an official one.

396
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,380
Second,

397
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,570
it solves the problem right away.

398
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,460
Li Qingliu,

399
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,180
I used to see you as a talent

400
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,050
and tried to make you my son-in-law.

401
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,700
It’s a pity

402
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,420
that you’ve let me down a lot.

403
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,460
Don’t blame me for being unmerciful.

404
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,420
= Zuixian Tea House =

405
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,050
Hi.

406
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,730
Tell me, why did you invite me here again?

407
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,420
What business do you want to talk about?

408
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,570
The commissioner

409
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,250
asked me to escort Nyuertu to Jia’ermu.

410
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,180
Delivering goods?

411
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,140
I wouldn’t do it.

412
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,460
The responsibility falls on my shoulder

413
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
if anything happens.

414
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,380
I’m here to ask you

415
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,700
if there’s any escort agency to trust?

416
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,900
Of course it’s...

417
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,490
Do you know any guard that’s good enough?

418
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,570
Escorting is not about the guards.

419
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,940
There will always be more
enemies than guards.

420
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,570
It’s reputation that matters.

421
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,380
Can I count on your reputation?

422
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,980
Let me borrow people form
your gang to join me.

423
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,460
I’m old and slow now.

424
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,700
I haven’t been on escort for long.

425
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,620
Fine.

426
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,380
I’ll see you later then.

427
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,380
Sit down.

428
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,250
I was just kidding.

429
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,140
What’s your ideal price?

430
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,570
I know the value of Nyuertu.

431
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,530
Forget it if we can’t agree on the price.

432
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,180
Tell me about the escorting market first.

433
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,940
If you want my help, we need some rules.

434
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:03,900
First.

435
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,090
Once we set off,

436
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,980
I’ll be fully responsible for the goods.

437
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,570
Second.

438
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,700
Listen to the guards.

439
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,330
You can’t interfere in their behaviors.

440
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,420
Third.

441
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,380
We don’t only escort your goods.

442
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,250
Don’t ask about other goods
that I deliver.

443
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,670
What an unfair treaty.

444
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,560
As an employer,

445
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,080
why can’t we do anything?

446
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
What do you know?

447
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,120
These are the regular rules of
Longzhu Gang.

448
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,670
Deal.

449
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,470
Nice.

450
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,630
Go home and prepare the deposit

451
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,430
if nothing else.

452
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,840
Meet at the big bazar tomorrow.

453
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,760
Xiaoqin, see them off.

454
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,600
Wait.

455
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,360
We’re at the tea house.

456
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,150
It’s not your turn to let us out.

457
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,190
Yan Bin, let’s go.

458
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,630
Master.

459
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,840
The fate between you and

460
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,990
Master Li is wonderful.

461
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,800
You guys can’t be separated.

462
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,150
Now you’re going on a trip together.

463
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,840
It’s not fate. I’m earning money.

464
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,800
Master.

465
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,630
We have excellent fighters.

466
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,230
Why would we need guards

467
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,880
during this trip to Jia’ermu?

468
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,710
Like what Master Long has said,

469
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,320
There will always be more
enemies than guards.

470
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,950
It’s reputation that matters.

471
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,360
I think you just found an excuse,

472
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
any excuse,

473
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,280
to bring Master Long with us,

474
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,910
isn’t it?

475
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,230
Don’t talk this much during the trip.

476
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,840
I’m determined to go.

477
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,320
Save your speech, Mr. Du.

478
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,470
Your Highness.

479
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,320
I’d sacrifice my life

480
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,360
for you not to go to Jia’ermu.

481
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,430
They can go,

482
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,600
how come I can’t?

483
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,800
Jia’ermu is at a strategic point,

484
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,910
so conflicts happen a lot.

485
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,630
People there are fierce, too.

486
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,910
What if something happen to you?

487
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,910
I can’t take the responsibility.

488
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,840
Rather than pretending to worry about me,

489
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,950
you should worry about
the upcoming investigations

490
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,360
from the Court of Censors.

491
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,560
Mr. Du,

492
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,630
like I said.

493
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,760
I can put on disguise on the trip.

494
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,670
Besides, if it’s as dangerous

495
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,990
as you just described,

496
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,560
why did you send Li Qingliu and Long Aoyi?

497
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,390
What?

498
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,280
Well,

499
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,320
I only sent Li Qingliu,

500
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,990
not Long Aoyi.

501
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,560
Based on what I’ve heard,

502
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,360
they are going together.

503
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,280
Your Highness. You are the prince.

504
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,950
They are just normal people.

505
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,630
How can you compare yourself

506
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,760
with the ordinary?

507
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,630
And you should decide

508
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,230
after reading the letter

509
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,360
from Concubine De.

510
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Who told Mother about this?

511
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,840
It just arrived this morning.

512
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,500
= Dear Son =

513
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,760
She asked me to go back immediately.

514
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,120
With Long Aoyi coming,

515
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,040
it’d be as good as killing two birds
with one stone.

516
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,950
Are you delivering goods or just yarns?

517
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,120
According to the third rule,

518
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,560
you have no right to ask me that.

519
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,390
We’re going on a long and hard trip,

520
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,670
aren’t you afraid of burdens?

521
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,600
You don’t need to pull the cart.

522
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,390
Do you want

523
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,600
everything and everyone to be safe?

524
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,320
Since we’re going faraway,

525
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,990
what’s wrong with delivering goods
to earn money?

526
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,040
Master Long,

527
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,670
this is not a fruit store.

528
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,190
If you keep eating like this,

529
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,470
we’ll be running out of spring tea.

530
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,360
Nonsense.

531
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,390
I’ll be on a long trip.

532
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,760
I want to bring some good stuff there.

533
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,520
But the fresh tea won’t be fresh

534
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,840
when we get Jia’ermu.

535
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,990
It’s said people there

536
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,390
like drinking tea dusts.

537
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,800
Tea dusts?

538
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
Yeah, get us some tea dusts.

539
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,600
Sure.

540
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,230
Stingy. Bring us all of your stock

541
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,390
to the entrance.

542
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,150
Yes, yes.

543
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:31,760
My Lord.

544
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,800
My Lord, they’re all carefully sealed

545
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,880
with sealing wax.

546
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,630
As long as they pass the gate,
we’ll arrest them all.

547
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,390
This time,

548
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,950
nobody can help them.

549
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,320
Load them up at the city’s entrance,
be careful.

550
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,710
Yes.

551
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,300
= Xinsilu =

552
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,710
= Xinsilu =
Master Li.

553
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,190
County magistrate.

554
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Since you’re going to Jia’ermu,

555
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,990
according to the regulations,

556
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,880
you have to bring the Customs Pass

557
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,190
in case of inspections.

558
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,980
These are

559
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,570
the Nyuertu

560
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,010
for Jia’ermu.

561
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,290
County magistrate,

562
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,980
they are already waxed.

563
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,620
How am I supposed to check the goods?

564
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,290
It’s Jiannan Dao’s official wax.

565
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,490
Except for inspectors and
the emperor of Jia’ermu,

566
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,700
nobody is allowed to open.

567
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,490
As long as the wax is complete,

568
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,380
you don’t have

569
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,860
to worry about the goods inside.

570
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:51,980
Good luck.

571
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,180
Master.

572
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,700
Take it.

573
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,050
Yes.

574
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,570
Take care of the Customs Pass.

575
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,220
Miss Long.

576
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:23,940
A word.

577
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,810
Where are the people of Longzhu Gang?

578
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,940
Since Qinglong Firm is newly founded,

579
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,180
people are busy.

580
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,180
I told them not to come.

581
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,980
Your Highness, too.

582
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,570
You don’t have to see me off.

583
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,620
I’d join you if

584
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,460
there wasn’t an emergency in Chang’an.

585
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,050
This trip to Jia’ermu will be dangerous.

586
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,860
Please be careful.

587
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,290
Alright.

588
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,570
If anything comes up,

589
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,660
don’t be the hero,

590
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,770
run if you can.

591
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,620
Of course I know that

592
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,380
after all these years in the society.

593
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,380
Wait for me to come back

594
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,420
and bring you a gift.

595
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,380
What do you want?

596
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,490
I don’t want anything,

597
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,810
as long as you come back safely.

598
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,420
I’ll go back to the Silver City

599
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,620
once I finish my business in Chang’an.

600
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,570
See you.

601
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,140
= Xinsilu =

602
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,380
Is it the left one?

603
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,700
You’re silly, you couldn’t tell.

604
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,490
Don’t blame me.

605
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,530
Well, can we find a good place
to eat later?

606
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,010
You called me silly,
not dreaming about food.

607
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,050
It hurts.

608
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,380
- Stop pinching, it hurts.
- No.

609
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,490
You deserve it.

610
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,220
- They look like a good match, right?
- You haven’t answered my question.

611
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,220
Aren’t they?

612
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,860
Stop talking about them.

613
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,770
I don’t care.

614
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,290
May I ask this couple,

615
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,660
is it the Silver City right there?

616
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,380
We’re not a...

617
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,490
Keep walking on this path,
you’ll get there.

618
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,700
What are you doing there
with so many people?

619
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,490
We,

620
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,290
we are escaped refugees from
other provinces.

621
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,530
We’re going there to find a living.

622
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,730
You love birds

623
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,050
should prepare enough food.

624
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,950
There will be no place to rest

625
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,900
if you keep going.

626
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:00,870
Thank you.

627
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,600
Bye.

628
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:03,860
Come on.

629
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,180
- What’s wrong with him?
- Come on. Let’s go.

630
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,660
Why would he suspect that we’re...

631
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,490
Well...

632
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,900
Sichuan has always been rich and populous,

633
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,090
and famine is rare.

634
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,380
Maybe they met with banditry.

635
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,530
Let’s go.

636
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,810
Master.

637
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,460
Watch out.

638
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:38,940
Okay.

639
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,900
Clothes, gambling and whoring are

640
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,570
no better than eating food.

641
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,010
Master Li,

642
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,330
try this dish

643
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,250
if you will.

644
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,290
Don’t the lower class

645
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,530
use chopsticks?

646
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,570
I can feed you.

647
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,010
Let me.

648
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,490
No.

649
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,380
Don’t step back.

650
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,140
Let me, don’t run.

651
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,100
- I can’t stand it.
- I can feed you.

652
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,810
Yan Bin.

653
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,730
I never know that you can be so dramatic.

654
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,050
Now,

655
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,290
act all the one hundred and eight plays

656
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,490
for us one by one.

657
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,770
Finish before you sleep.

658
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,900
Stop kidding, Master.

659
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,140
If I want to finish them all,

660
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,980
I’ll still be here when you’re back
from Jia’ermu.

661
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,330
But my question is.

662
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,090
Master Li.

663
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,810
Why do you back away
whenever you see women?

664
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,940
Women aren’t monsters.

665
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,940
They don’t eat you alive.

666
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
I’m just curious.

667
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,050
People in the city say

668
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,530
that Master Li doesn’t fancy women.

669
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,180
Maybe...

670
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,490
Maybe I’m a gay.

671
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,860
I don’t mean that.

672
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,770
I, I don’t mean that.

673
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,290
I mean

674
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,980
a guy can

675
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,050
dislike some of the women.

676
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,380
But it’s a bit weird

677
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,250
to dislike all of them.

678
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,940
How do you know

679
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,010
that I don’t like women?

680
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,980
Then, who do you like?

681
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,220
Or who did you like?

682
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,050
Alright, alright. Stop teasing him.

683
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,420
You want to know, too?

684
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,380
Me?

685
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,140
Why would I want to know?

686
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,490
Eat the porridge, it’s getting cold.

687
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,420
Yes, Master.

688
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,280
Let’s go.

689
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,810
Greetings to Mother.

690
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,700
Now you know the rules.

691
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,490
I heard that you had fun
in the Silver City?

692
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,700
I’ve never been to that wonderland.

693
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,660
After the country is in peace,

694
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,530
I’ll ask for His Majesty’s permission

695
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,330
to check out the brothels
or goof at the quay.

696
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,380
It was my fault.

697
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,900
Please punish me.

698
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,250
Punishing you

699
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,330
would be a shame for me, too.

700
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
Now that you’re back.

701
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,860
It’s time to restrain yourself
and plan for the future.

702
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,090
Mother is right.

703
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,250
But,

704
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,860
what’s with the rush

705
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,980
of calling me back?

706
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,810
I heard that you wrote

707
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,380
a secret letter to the Court of Censors.

708
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,340
Yes.

709
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,380
Uncle holds an important post

710
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,900
at the Ministry of Revenue,
does he know already?

711
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,780
Mother, you don’t know

712
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,780
that during my trip to the city,

713
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,900
I found that the quantity
of pepper was questionable.

714
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,780
Following the lead,

715
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,490
I found that Du Changfeng

716
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,170
was colluding with local...

717
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,090
Stop investigating this.

718
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:48,650
Why?

719
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,260
You’ve grown up.

720
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,940
It’s time to learn the rules in the court.

721
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,340
Among the councilors,

722
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,260
no one is entirely innocent.

723
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,460
Whoever you want to deal with,

724
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,380
don’t judge based on his behaviors

725
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,530
but on who is he working for.

726
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,010
I don’t understand.

727
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,380
Why can’t I investigate about

728
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,570
Du Changfeng’s corruption?

729
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,420
Are you disobeying me right now?

730
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,860
I dare not. It’s just...

731
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,210
Prince Zhao is back.

732
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,050
Uncle.

733
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,820
I now command you

734
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,380
to go back home and think about
what you did.

735
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,860
Don’t come out until you’re clear.

736
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,210
I need to talk to your uncle.

737
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:39,940
Yes.

738
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,570
Concubine De,

739
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,610
items on the list

740
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,610
are all sorted and well-preserved.

741
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,610
Thank Mr. Du for me.

742
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,210
That’s very considerate of him.

743
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,250
How’s

744
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,770
his plan going?

745
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,340
To answer that,

746
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
things in the Silver City

747
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,530
are all under Du Changfeng’s control.

748
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,860
He’ll clean the mess

749
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,050
before he arrives

750
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,050
at Chang’an.

751
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,610
Don’t worry.

752
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,860
We’d arrive at the Tuojiang River
Quay soon.

753
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,210
Normally there aren’t many people.

754
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,490
Let’s go.

755
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,340
Go away. Step aside. Go away.

756
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,860
What are you doing?

757
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,050
I know you’re rich,

758
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,260
don’t block my way.

759
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,940
They are waiting for our goods
at the quay.

760
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,490
Sir,

761
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,130
seems like the quay is more crowded
than ever.

762
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,380
Anyone big coming?

763
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Nobody is coming.

764
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,390
Along the path,

765
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,760
it’s filled with people
fleeing from famine.

766
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,910
When the land is barren,

767
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,320
the quay gets crowded.

768
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,390
A crowded quay?

769
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,800
How long has it been?

770
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,510
Just a few days.

771
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,590
But, after a dozen of days,

772
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,550
the quay will be more crowded.

773
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,710
Let’s go. Come on. We’re getting there.

774
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,000
- Come on.
- Let’s go.

775
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,140
Hurry, hurry.

776
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:27,770
Hurry up.

777
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,070
What would the court do
if a blank year comes.

778
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,910
According to the regulations,

779
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,430
when a blank year starts,

780
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,240
all the transportation

781
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,880
will change from the land to water.

782
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,800
The whole transportation system

783
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,240
will be built based on the canals.

784
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,840
So what?

785
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,550
That’s a huge opportunity.

786
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,280
How about cooperating with me
for a big business?

787
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,720
How big?

788
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,070
Don’t underestimate me.

789
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,640
Ships can park at the Silver City
due to its long shoreline.

790
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,550
If we control the shipping space
at the quay,

791
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,680
and use some

792
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,430
to change for space at other places.

793
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,880
When the water transport is on,

794
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,390
we have shipping space

795
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,800
along the whole waterway.

796
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,510
We’d be earning big money.

797
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,430
I can handle renting spaces
and money.

798
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,800
But the Water Gang...

799
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,840
I’ll handle them.

800
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,720
