32
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,810
I recommend availing

33
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,660
the secret channel of water transport

34
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,660
to transfer grains from south to north

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,740
and thus address the problem
of grain undersupply in Chang’an.

36
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,340
Your Majesty!

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,340
I have been in Xichuan Dao for years

38
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,490
but never heard about
the secret channel of water transport.

39
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,130
People of the Water Gang

40
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,420
talked about the secret channel.

41
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,220
The gate is closed normally

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,930
but will be opened

43
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,130
as ordered

44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,130
to create a channel for boat access

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,130
whenever necessary.

46
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,490
Your Majesty!

47
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,730
Even if there is such a secret channel,

48
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,060
great military forces will be needed.

49
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,340
Considering the threats in Hebei,

50
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,140
I am afraid of inadequate defense

51
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,210
if military forces
are used for water transport.

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,740
Father,

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,530
I agree we shouldn’t allocate large-scale

54
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,020
military forces for water transport.

55
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,150
But we can avail civil forces,

56
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,740
for instance, allowing Qinglong Firm
to assist with transport of relief grains.

57
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,380
Father!

58
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,170
Prince Jun had shares
in predecessor of Qinglong Firm.

59
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,420
Our law bans officials
from doing businesses.

60
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,500
It is improper for Prince Jun

61
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,740
to recommend Qinglong Firm repeatedly.

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,100
I completely withdrew myself from

63
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,530
Qinglong Firm before coming to Chang’an.

64
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,660
Complete withdrawal?

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,100
The big boss of Qinglong Firm is still

66
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,740
nursing her infant at your home now.

67
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,170
We are talking about the famine now.

68
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,530
Please don’t get off the subject,
Prince Zhao!

69
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,050
This is new rice from Lingnan.

70
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,690
Please check it, Father.

71
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,970
As the first harvest of the quarter,

72
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,140
it was delivered by Qinglong Firm.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,660
It took only ten days for the trip

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,810
from Lingnan to Chang’an.

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,890
We have to consider the urgency of it.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,050
As the famine is worsening now,

77
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,410
I recommend working with Qinglong Firm

78
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,610
to settle the emergency needs first.

79
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,140
I agree with Prince Jun.

80
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,100
The famine condition is changing daily.

81
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,380
Without a fundamental solution,

82
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,140
I am afraid there may be civil riots.

83
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,200
I believe

84
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,780
only the proposal of Prince Jun

85
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,740
can address the temporary lack of grain.

86
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Approved!

87
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,570
Requisition civil forces for transport

88
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,810
of grains from south to north.

89
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,960
The Agricultural Agency and
the Ministry of Revenue will supervise it.

90
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,480
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

91
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,850
- Great to see you, Your Highness!
- Great to see you, Your Highness!

92
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,530
Stand up!

93
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,570
His Majesty has emaciated a lot

94
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,570
for the famine relief

95
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,530
these days.

96
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,650
As a royal member,

97
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,550
we should also contribute our ideas

98
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,930
although we are in the harem.

99
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,630
I really appreciate your good faith,
Your Highness!

100
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,330
I personally recommend

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
donating part of our monthly wages

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,000
to buy relief grains.

103
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,800
Your Highness, I think

104
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,800
Concubine De’s idea is good.

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,080
Moreover,

106
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,240
we can also set up porridge shops
in neighborhoods

107
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,430
to guarantee smooth grain supply

108
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,240
to the people and

109
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,310
display His Majesty’s love for the people.

110
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
Great.

111
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,430
Let’s

112
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,470
just contribute

113
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,360
three parts of our monthly wage.

114
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,970
How much is three parts?

115
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,740
It means we donate thirty percent
of our wage to buy grains.

116
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,150
I have to donate my own money

117
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,190
when nobody pays me wages?

118
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,470
Who dares to gossip

119
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,840
on Her Highness’s benevolence?

120
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,120
I was asking about

121
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,430
three parts.

122
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,310
More importantly,

123
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,630
our contributions

124
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,430
are just nominal in face of the famine.

125
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,400
It is really a lack of love.

126
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,190
Please punish her as a warning to others,

127
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Your Highness!

128
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,840
Forget it, Concubine De.

129
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,870
She is pregnant.

130
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,470
Just copy one volume of scripture
as a penalty.

131
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,470
The Stewardess Office will supervise it.

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,120
Yes, Your Highness!

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,430
Yes.

134
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,260
= Scripture =

135
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
How much is left?

136
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,480
Less than half is done.

137
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,040
I am sleepy.

138
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,830
It seems

139
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,070
text copying is the only way
to keep you disciplined.

140
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,390
Are you going to do it for me?

141
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,240
Great!

142
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,390
I will go and have some midnight snack.

143
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,480
Don’t go away.

144
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
I am doing it for you.

145
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,000
I am helping you.

146
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,480
Just sit by my side here.

147
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Your nose looks so beautiful.

148
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,010
Your mouth looks beautiful too.

149
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,000
So many eyelashes!

150
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,430
What beautiful eyelashes!

151
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,230
You are a bad guy to look at me that way.

152
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,690
Your behavior reflects your mind.

153
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,400
Are you thinking of any bad idea?

154
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,580
Don’t run away.

155
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,410
I didn’t mean it.

156
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,370

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,370
the complete map

160
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:17,970
Yes.

161
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,100
Weng Dayou just sent a few drafts here.

162
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,370
He said you would understand
when you saw it.

163

Come on.

164

First step, cross over Xiazhou.

165
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,220
Second step, enter Kuiguan.

166

Third step, get around Qinchuan.

167
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,730
Fourth step, enter Chang’an stably.

168
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,930
What does it mean?

169
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,100
This is the secret words of Weng Dayou.

170
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,460
He means

171
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,050
the convenient water channels other than

172
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,260
official and civil water courses.

173
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,610
They include the secret branches of

174
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,610
the four main rivers, namely

175
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,050
Yangtze River, Yellow River,

176
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,050
Han River and Wei River.

177
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,900
In that case,

178
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,780
we will have quicker and
more convenient water courses.

179
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,490
Now we have

180
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,580
both the labor resources and channels.

181
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,780
It depends on our efforts

182
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,260
to rescue the famine victims.

183
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,820
Go ahead!

184
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,490
Go ahead!

185
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,140
Go ahead!

186
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,370
News!

187
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,700
Ten thousand Dan relief grains
have arrived at Chang’an Terminal.

188
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,660
News!

189
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,730
Ten thousand Dan relief grains
have arrived at Chang’an Terminal.

190
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,820
Your Majesty!

191
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,490
The first consignment of relief grains

192
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,530
has arrived in Chang’an.

193
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,700
The second consignment
of twenty thousand Dan relief grains

194
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,850
has also arrived in Chang’an.

195
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,930
Qingliu,

196
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,780
you have done a good job.

197
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,360
= Dongshi Market =

198
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,650
Give me some food!

199
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,300
Don’t go further ahead. Back out.

200
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,730
= Pingkang Lane =
- Give me some food! - Back out.

201
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,700
Don’t push.

202
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,580
- Give me some food!
- Back out, don’t push.

203
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,730
- Sir, give me some food.
- Back out.

204
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,580
Hurry up, no more nonsense.

205
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,380
There is food.

206
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,080
Don’t grab for it.

207
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,340
Don’t grab for it. It is mine.

208
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,340
Hurry up, give it to me.

209
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,700
Hurry up, fill it.

210
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,690
I want rice.

211
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,920
Hurry up, give me a pocket.

212
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,010
Come here quickly.

213
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,860
Give it to me.

214
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,700
They said your family isn’t reliable.

215
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,660
Grains are unloaded onshore continuously.

216
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,100
Why can’t they reach the hand of people?

217
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,340
Master Long visited the relief points
off the city today but

218
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,390
found that many relief grains delivered

219
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,200
by Qinglong Firm couldn’t
reach the hands of famine victims.

220
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,100
Really?

221
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,900
Yes.

222
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,580
= Chonghua Lane =
Madam, is the porridge enough?

223
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,820
I am satisfied. At least I won’t starve.

224
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,930
Haven’t the relief grains

225
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,170
arrived in large quantities?

226
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,660
Yes, they have arrived.

227
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,970
It is said the boss of Qinglong Firm

228
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,100
personally presided over the transport.

229
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,410
So what?

230
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
South-to-north grain transport!

231
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,370
There are many big boats

232
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,980
carrying grains from the south.

233
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,170
You, you and you,

234
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,190
who has ever eaten any food?

235
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,490
Master,

236
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,470
the unloaded relief grains were

237
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,220
delivered into the official barns
by carriages of the Ministry of Revenue

238
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,180
but transferred into the army granary

239
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,300
in the evening.

240
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,890
Now I understand why grains keep

241
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,100
arriving here but nothing happens there.

242
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,420
They are just taken away by the army.

243
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,700
It is a serious business.

244
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,220
I will report it to His Majesty tomorrow.

245
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,700
Father!

246
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
Two consignments of grains
have arrived in Chang’an.

247
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,250
But so far as I know,

248
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,930
not many grains have been received

249
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,460
by the official barns for famine relief.

250
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,850
Mr. Pang,

251
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,540
as head of the Ministry of Revenue,

252
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,580
do you know about it?

253
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,000
Your Majesty!

254
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,180
The transported grains were limited
this time.

255
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,060
Only a handful was left

256
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,490
after normal use.

257
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
So far as I know,

258
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,820
they were mostly used for the army.

259
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,850
Your Majesty!

260
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,220
The war isn’t yet settled in the north

261
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,540
and military provisions are
in short supply.

262
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,130
Many of the grains have been used

263
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,700
as military grains and provisions.

264
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,890
Foreign states have cast their eyes
on our state for long.

265
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,390
I have done it for our national interests.

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,560
Your Majesty! Frankly,

267
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,350
the river courses are smooth indeed.

268
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,540
But the carrying capacity is limited.

269
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,970
Hurry up, everybody.

270
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
= Jun =
Make sure all lanterns

271
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,370
have a red tassel under it.

272
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,890
Some important guests will come soon.

273
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,970
We must show him enough honors.

274
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,350
Miss Du, congratulations!

275
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,150
This is a gift for you.

276
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
Thank you, girls.

277
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:30,940
Yue’er,

278
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
take them to take a seat.

279
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,370
This way, please!

280
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,770
The marriage is pending.

281
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,130
Frankly, I recommend

282
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,060
visiting Prince Jun’s Mansion more

283
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,540
instead of

284
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,300
dressing up yourself here.

285
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,430
Let me tell you, Miss Xu,

286
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,970
there is another girl

287
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,970
in Prince Jun’s Mansion.

288
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,100
Xiaoxian,

289
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,890
I think you are too kind indeed.

290
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,460
You are the legal wife.

291
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,420
Without good rules,

292
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,890
the girls by the side of Prince Jun

293
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,220
will not respect you

294
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,060
in the future.

295
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,490
That woman is from the Silver City.

296
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,250
I know her actually.

297
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,770
She is pregnant with Qingliu’s baby now.

298
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,420
However wronged I may feel,

299
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,900
I can’t make any mistake
on the birth of imperial descendants.

300
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,970
This is Chang’an, a place of top goodness.

301
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,370
No violation of customs and codes

302
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,770
is permitted here.

303
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,300
What ideas do you have

304
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,420
to punish that Lady Long

305
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,700
so that she can behave herself?

306
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,100
No, if we go too far,

307
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,250
Qingliu may be alerted.

308
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,490
Just take it easy!

309
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,460
We have experiences.

310
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,460
Whoever hurts my friend

311
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,340
won’t get away with it easily.

312
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,420
It is Shangsi Festival on March 3.

313
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,220
All the flowers

314
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,700
are basically in full blossom
in the harem.

315
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,770
I didn’t expect it was true.

316
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,700
His Majesty favored her

317
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,890
for three days consecutively.

318
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,540
Have you seen her forehead?

319
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,770
The mark is said to have been removed

320
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,180
by a formula of Lady Long.

321
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,650
She is pretty and
completely a new person now.

322
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,610
No wonder she is favored by His Majesty!

323
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,580
I am no longer afraid of those gossipers.

324
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
Thank you for your unique secret formula.

325
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,770
You are an inborn beauty.

326
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,220
My formula is just a folk prescription

327
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,370
and a supplement to your beauty.

328
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,650
Supplement?

329
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,220
Long Aoyi’s formula?

330
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,340
Yes.

331
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,130
Great to see you, Your Grace.

332
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,130
Lady Long!

333
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,770
You are favored by Prince Jun now.

334
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,730
So we hope to make friends with you.

335
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,650
What is that?

336
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,420
It is a silk fan I have taken
from the south

337
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,970
particularly for you.

338
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,250
Please kindly accept it

339
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,370
as a token of goodwill from us.

340
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,890
If it is a goodwill from you,

341
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,250
I will accept it.

342
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,420
I think

343
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,250
this fan must be very valuable.

344
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,130
According to
material and production method,

345
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,540
the top-grade one is worth
one thousand gold ingots.

346
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,490
My goodness, buy a fan
with one thousand gold ingots?

347
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,890
Check it for me.

348
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,540
Dress up more
in a weather like this in March.

349
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,540
Xiaoxian, just wait and see.

350
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,460
I am allergic to pollens.

351
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,700
It is really interesting.

352
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,370
Some people are allergic to pollens.

353
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,820
Some are allergic to women.

354
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,220
Is there anyone allergic to women?

355
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,130
Li Qingliu is allergic to women.

356
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,180
Really?

357
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:04,850
Yes.

358
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,460
What a familiar smell!

359
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,850
It seems to be the pollen rogue

360
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,850
that Master used to deal in.

361
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,610
It is really stramonium.

362
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,490
Stop!

363
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,220
It is always the same programs
at Shangsi Festival every year.

364
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,250
Do you have anything new?

365
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,130
Your Highness!

366
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,250
The acrobatics to pray for good luck and

367
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,610
famine relief this year
must be ready soon.

368
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,010
Please wait.

369
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,610
Really?

370
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,930
Your Highness!

371
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,850
May I play

372
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,770
a piece of music for all

373
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,580
when we are waiting for it?

374
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,420
No, no.

375
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,060
I have listened to it for numerous times

376
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,950
these days.

377
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,540
I am already

378
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,300
fed up with it.

379
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,370
Yes.

380
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,650
Your Highness!

381
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,130
Isn’t that the lady who is

382
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,850
a headache even to the Stewardess Office?

383
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,970
It is really boring now.

384
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,100
I have a proposal.

385
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,540
What is your proposal?

386
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,100
I wish to

387
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,490
perform a folk skirt dance

388
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,730
for you all.

389
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,060
But this dance

390
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
requires cooperation from others.

391
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,100
There was already a dance just now.

392
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,770
Her Highness doesn’t like it.

393
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,610
It is a different dance.

394
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,060
The dancing style

395
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,700
originates from Jia’ermu.

396
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,610
The girls there are free and casual

397
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,460
and they take off their blouses
for dancing.

398
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,610
All of us present here are girls

399
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,300
from royal and aristocratic families

400
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,420
instead of the low-class dancing girls.

401
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,130
Your Highness!

402
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,070
It is an excursion and picnic

403
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,370
and we need to fully enjoy the sunshine.

404
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,820
If you

405
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,610
dress up yourself

406
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
so heavily,

407
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,250
you will find it great trouble to move,

408
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,180
let alone feel the liberty of life

409
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,650
in a real sense.

410
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,100
How will Her Highness
agree on your nonsense!

411
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,730
It is fairly new and interesting.

412
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,340
Okay, who would you choose as partners?

413
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,610
Choose anyone as you wish.

414
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,490
Thanks, Your Highness!

415
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,890
You, please.

416
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,480
Stand up, hurry up!

417
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,890
Dance together.

418
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,540
Dance. Dance.

419
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,220
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

420
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,130
You two, dance together.

421
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,520
Start turning! Start turning!

422
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,130
Hurry up!

423
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,300
Okay, okay, okay!

424
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,360
Stop it, everybody.

425
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,210
This is really a good dance.

426
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,760
Everyone will be rewarded.

427
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,100
Particularly, this Lady Long

428
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,060
shall be rewarded more.

429
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,890
Thanks, Your Highness!

430
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,130
Invite the Indian acrobat.

431
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,110
Long Aoyi, let’s wait and see.

432
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,610
Snake, there is a snake.

433
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,100
There is nothing to be afraid of.

434
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,890
It is just a snake.

435
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,610
You don’t have to panic.

436
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,740
The snake can dance too.

437
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,450
It is a dancer.

438
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,930
But it is also poisonous.

439
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,050
Long Aoyi,

440
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,460
go to hell with your baby.

441
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,440
The stramonium really
works to lure the serpent.

442
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,180
Qingliu!

443
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,440
Are you OK?

444
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,450
Luckily you arrived just in time.

445
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,510
This Indian guest, please explain

446
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,690
why the snake suddenly

447
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,880
got out of control.

448
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,430
There hasn’t been any problem
with the snake.

449
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,240
Maybe it is spring time now

450
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,590
and it is instable emotionally.

451
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,750
All the people here are imperial wives
and concubines in the park today.

452
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,510
All those preparing for the acrobatics

453
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,510
must take responsibility

454
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,400
for the accident

455
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,510
today.

456
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,860
This…

457
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,780
Whipping for twenty times each!

458
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,480
Go and get the punishment.

459
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,590
Yes.

460
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,030
Will our garden party continue then?

461
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,160
Dismissed!

462
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,590
Let me take you back.

463
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,110
Are you OK?

464
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,680
You think of me now?

465
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Don’t make a fuss again.

466
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,720
Men like you

467
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,590
always favor gentle and soft girls.

468
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,510
But remember,

469
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,790
the most beautiful snake
is the most poisonous.

470
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,880
Take care, or you may be poisoned.

471
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,750
This is the soup boiled

472
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,880
with Xinlong red ginseng.

473
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,070
It has particularly good
comforting effects.

474
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,480
Thanks, Your Grace!

475
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,830
I think you are intelligent enough.

476
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,340
Why

477
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,540
did you allow Yan’er

478
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,930
to take such a reckless action this time?

479
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,580
I am sorry.

480
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,130
I didn’t mean to put Yan’er in trouble.

481
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,650
Forget it.

482
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,540
I am not blaming you.

483
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,890
She is an inborn reckless girl anyway.

484
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Thank you for your understanding.

485
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,690
Yan’er

486
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,340
is too kindhearted.

487
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,410
She just can’t tolerate

488
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,170
Long Aoyi’s taking herself

489
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,060
as hostess of Prince Jun’s Mansion

490
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,060
when I am going to

491
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,170
marry Prince Jun soon.

492
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,450
So she stood out

493
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,930
for me.

494
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,340
Stood out for you?

495
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,740
She is just a low girl.

496
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,540
You are the hostess in the future.

497
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,980
Please give me your advice, Your Grace!

498
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,060
You are scared

499
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,370
and harmed now.

500
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,370
Maybe we can do something on it.

501
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,060
This…

502
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,060
It is time to let others know

503
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,500
who the hostess

504
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,210
of Prince Jun’s Mansion is in the future.

505
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,820
= Qinglong Firm =

506
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,500
I am fed up with it.

507
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,130
Miss, you are back.

508
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,890
What have you found?

509
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,450
Here.

510
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,260
It looks like new rice.

511
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,340
You asked us to investigate into

512
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,300
the grain market of Chang’an.

513
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,450
The rice was really sold out.

514
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,300
But

515
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,580
we still found the secret.

516
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,060
Some people are peddling the grains
in the black market.

517
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,890
The price is 20 times higher

518
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,170
than it was before the famine.

519
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,340
Isn’t that kind of robbery?

520
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,130
Who is the seller?

521
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,100
I haven’t found their identities.

522
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,930
But these people were really vigilant.

523
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,780
They went away
when they saw strangers like us.

524
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,210
I just had time to get the rice here.

525
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,340
I think it must be an expert.

526
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,580
Let’s go back to Prince Jun’s Mansion.

527
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,060
Go.

528
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,270
Give me a steamed bread.

529
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,540
Give me a steamed bread.

530
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,890
Don’t worry, everybody has it.

531
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,170
Miss, let me do it.

532
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,250
It is okay with me.

533
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,370
Thanks.

534
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,570
Come on.

535
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,680
Don’t worry.

536
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,130
Give me one more steamed bread.

537
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,730
Everyone will have food.

538
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,170
Nobody will be ignored.

539
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,610
She is Princess Jun.

540
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,540
She is so pretty like an angel.

541
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,410
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =
It is a favor from Prince Jun.

542
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,840
In the next few days,

543
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,030
steamed bread will be
available to you all.

544
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,500
- Great.
- Thanks, Prince Jun.

545
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,010
Princess Jun is really a good person.

546
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,680
What a good person!

547
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,340
Really good.

548
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,740
Give me one more steamed bread.

549
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,850
Qingliu, you are back.

550
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,130
What are you doing here?

551
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,130
I have prepared some steamed bread

552
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,650
for all victims of the city.

553
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,410
Xiaoxian, you haven’t recovered.

554
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,410
You don’t have to do it.

555
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,500
I feel happy to share your worries.

556
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,930
I have prepared some sweet soup.

557
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,410
Just follow me inside.

558
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,300
I have something to talk to you.

559
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:43,980
Let’s go.

560
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,490
Come in and drink some sweet soup.

561
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,580
It has been long
since we got to know each other.

562
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,780
I hope you can put aside your prejudice

563
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,780
and get together with me safely

564
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,450
at the mansion in the future.

565
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,300
Good idea.

566
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,300
It seems

567
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,930
the incident of Shangsi Festival

568
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,410
has changed Miss Du thoroughly.

569
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,300
I almost forgot

570
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,130
to thank Pang Yan’er

571
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,130
for her fan. It really worked well.

572
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,850
Some people asked me

573
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,820
to send you to another place.

574
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,820
But I didn’t

575
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,890
because of our past friendship.

576
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,780
I will forget all the past conflicts.

577
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,640
But I hope you

578
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,960
can treasure our friendship.

579
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,070
What do you mean?

580
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,070
Look at yourself and your unruliness.

581
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,590
Unlike you,

582
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,480
I must consider him

583
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,610
after entering the silk store.

584
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,130
That is bundling of interests.

585
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,880
I wonder

586
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,700
who did businesses, learned design

587
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,560
and stole the new design drawings

588
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,400
of Xinsilu

589
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,480
after entering the silk store.

590
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,110
Isn’t that clear enough

591
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,680
whose interest is involved?

592
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,880
What do you mean on earth today?

593
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,550
Do you mean I crave for interests

594
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,640
and find a sugar daddy?

595
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,880
I should have approached Prince Zhao

596
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,550
in the Silver City if so.

597
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,510
I remember

598
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,790
you were really close to Prince Zhao.

599
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,790
So what?

600
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,440
You sang together,

601
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,680
drank together

602
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,030
and climbed onto the rooftop together.

603
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,070
Let me make some additions for you.

604
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,070
Gave away flowers, jewels and clothes.

605
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,940
So you still love Prince Zhao, right?

606
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
So what?

607
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,350
Prince Zhao and I…

608
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
- Drank…
- Enough.

609
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,550
You…

610
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:25,880
I…

611
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,070
Some people sold this twenty times more

612
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,240
expensive in the black market of Chang’an.

613
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,750
What?

614
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,110
What’s up?

615
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
You drink the sweet soup.
I have to go first.

616
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,440
Aoyi…

617
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,310
Are you okay?

618
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,480
= Court of Censors =

619
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,200
Today,

620
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,160
on this occasion of my daughter’s
wedding feast,

621
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,200
I have invited you all here

622
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,830
to provide your proposals for me.

623
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,720
You will certainly get rewarded.

624
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,110
Please enjoy the liquor

625
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,200
I have kept in storage for ten-plus years.

626
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,290
Cheers!

627
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,110
Although my daughter was away
from Chang’an as a child,

628
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,000
she is a girl of knowledge and courtesy.

629
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,680
As a military officer,

630
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,030
I have made no contribution

631
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,550
except expanding our territory.

632
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,600
So my daughter has become

633
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,980
my beloved.

634
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,250
Today, I would hand over all my fortunes

635
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,350
to my daughter Xiaoxian.

636
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,960
I hope the royal family can also recognize

637
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,720
marrying my daughter

638
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,000
isn’t a losing deal.

Xiaoxian,

642
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,030
I promised

643
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
you wouldn’t feel inferior

644
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,590
in Chang’an.

645
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,720
Come on, everybody,

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,110
of the relief grain funds this time

648
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,160
completely depends

649
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,440
on your sincere cooperation.

650
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,000
Cheers, everybody.

651
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,750
Mr. Du, you have worked the hardest.

652
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,700
Xiaoxian,

653
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,920
you withdraw first.

654
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,750
Come on, everybody,

655
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,720
cheers.

656
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,940
Somebody, serve the snacks.

657
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,590
Come on.

658
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,960
Serve the snacks.

659
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,070
Father,

660
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,510
I heard

661
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
new rice was sold in a large amount

662
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,350
at the black market recently.

663
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,350
But the sales price

664
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,880
is twenty times that of the normal price.

665
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,000
Grains are in undersupply in the city and

666
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,270
there are starving people everywhere.

667
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,920
But these people keep grains in stock

668
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,070
and refuse
to surrender them to the state depot.

669
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,480
We must find and punish them.

670
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,880
Really?

671
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,400
Your Majesty,

672
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,350
I am going to report on it.

673
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,810
There were always thieves who profited

674
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,400
from state disasters in all dynasties.

675
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,350
The Ministry of War has caught

676
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,350
some profiteers

677
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,480
in the Southern City

678
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,590
to assist the Ministry of Revenue

679
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,280
for famine relief

680
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,990
and they have all pleaded guilty.

681
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,310
If you have punished the profiteers,

682
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,880
let’s just put it aside.

683
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,720
Although waterborne grains are useful,

684
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,570
they can’t address the problem
of famines in Chang’an.

685
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,000
What are your opinions?

686
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,350
I believe we must thoroughly speed up

687
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,200
the transport of official grain channels

688
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,480
to address famine and undersupply

689
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,400
of military grains at the frontier.

690
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,750
For instance, the naturally risky parts
of the Three Gorges.

691
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,790
Nothing is more important

692
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,400
than frontier defense for a state.

693
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,680
We don’t have so many soldiers now.

694
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
Your Majesty,

695
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,960
I recommend closing the city gate

696
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,590
to keep away the famine victims.

697
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,830
Father, never do that.

698
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,350
If we close the gate to avoid disasters,

699
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,510
our people will be in chaos.

700
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Your Majesty, I have a proposal.

701
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,270
Go ahead, Mr. Yuan.

702
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,400
I believe

703
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,440
the transport capacity is an increasingly

704
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
serious problem
since the Rebellion of An and Shi.

705
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,440
It is getting out of control

706
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,240
today.

707
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,200
We can avail this chance

708
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,070
to mobilize all resources to address it.

709
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,920
I agree with you, Mr. Yuan.

710
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,400
Here is my order.

711
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,200
Figure out a way

712
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
in three days. Any adopted proposal

713
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,280
will be heavily rewarded.

714
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,620
Yes, Your Majesty!

715
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,890
You are dismissed.

716
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,510
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

717
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,960
Minister of Works is coming.

718
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,350
Great to see you, Your Highness!

719
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,270
Please take a seat, Minister Liu.

720
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,310
Thanks!

721
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,240
I have something to talk to you,

722
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,550
Mr. Liu.

723
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,960
Please go ahead, Your Highness!

724
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,270
It is said you

725
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,720
used to be a transport commissioner.

726
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
I wonder how the official channels

727
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,200
are working for water transport.

728
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,680
The Tang Dynasty has been prosperous

729
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,310
with affluent provisions for long.

730
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,400
But the official channels
for water transport

731
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,550
have been out of use for years.

732
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,240
Some are broken and blocked.

733
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,000
Only a handful of them are in use.

734
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,790
None is useful?

735
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,480
My errant boy is naughty.

736
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,790
Please forgive him.

737
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,880
It doesn’t matter.

738
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,510
Your inviting me here today

739
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,470
must be a task

740
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,310
allocated by His Majesty.

741
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,400
Exactly.

742
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,350
I want to know more

743
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
about water transport of our state.

744
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,990
The official channels of water transport

745
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,540
were left behind by the former dynasty.

746
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,290
But they haven’t been used
at our dynasty.

747
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,030
That is why we have to use

748
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,060
the civil water courses.

749
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,440
Where are the detailed maps
of official channels then?

750
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,960
The Wei family of the prior dynasty

751
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,070
had many transport commissioners.

752
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,960
They opened channels for trades

753
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,090
and produced detailed records.

754
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,040
But nobody is in charge of the channels

755
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,960
at our dynasty.

756
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,070
Why not ask your people to surrender

757
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,130
the secret channels of water transport?

758
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,240
In this case,

759
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,310
even if there isn’t a good solution,

760
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,260
His Majesty will feel satisfied.

761
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,000
Do you mean to steal the fruits

762
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,940
of civil water transport?

763
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,400
It is ridiculous.

764
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,560
The government have inadequate

765
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,270
resources to reestablish
water transport channels now.

766
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,660
But water transport

767
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,750
must be one of the targets of revival

768
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,310
of our dynasty.

769
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Don’t distinguish
official and civil channels so clearly.

770
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,480
You are expected to offer proposals.

771
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,620
How can you use my property

772
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,800
and take it away?

773
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,110
You…

774
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,510
How dare you

775
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,640
take away the teapot

776
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,040
instead of serving the guest.

777
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,000
I will even take away his clothing.

778
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,720
Don’t make a fuss.

779
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,110
I am sorry, Mr. Liu.

780
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,750
She is the one you mentioned just now.

781
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,880
I didn’t expect that you are Lady Long.

782
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
Nice to see you!

783
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,160
Yes, I am.

784
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,480
What else do you have to say?

785
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,310
Just finish it at a time

786
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,270
and I will say thank you at a time too.

787
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,510
Really impressive as they said.

788
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,670
What did they say?

789
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,590
It is said Your Highness adore her much.

790
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I have to say

791
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,000
you are really a perfect couple.

792
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,070
What’s up, Master?

793
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,360
Send a message to the court for me.

794
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,280
Give it to Officer Wei,

795
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,240
cousin of Concubine Han.

796
00:36:59,530 --> 00:36:59,920
Okay.

797
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,780
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

798
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,280
Xiaoxian!

799
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,280
Xiaoxian, are you looking for me?

800
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,490
Qingliu!

801
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,400
Xiaoxian!

802
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,710
We should behave ourselves
before marriage.

803
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,110
His Majesty already ordered our marriage.

804
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,320
I will become

805
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,480
your princess soon.

806
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,230
You said you had something to talk to me.

807
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,190
Follow me.

808
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,520
Miss,

809
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,600
why do you expect to meet

810
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,080
Officer Wei at midnight?

811
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,310
He is serving in the court

812
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,000
and has time for a meeting at the gate

813
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,640
only at this moment.

814
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,960
Why don’t you go in the daytime?

815
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,000
There isn’t enough time.

816
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,790
There must be a solution in three days.

817
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,960
You are not obligated to do it.

818
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,310
Why do you always help Prince Jun?

819
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,520
I am not helping him.

820
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,790
I am helping all victims of the city.

821
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,160
Miss, let’s go.

822
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Nobody knows

823
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,790
what has happened between them.

824
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,350
Just go away.

825
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,640
Don’t worry. Let’s enjoy it.

826
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,270
It is a good drama.

827
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,870
Let’s go.

828
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,480
Go on!

829
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,750
Miss!

830
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,680
Shame on you!

831
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Where are you going, Qingliu?

832
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,590
It is the fabric I have chosen carefully.

833
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,630
Is it fit for you?

834
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,280
Let’s try it on again.

835
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,660
= Tang =

836
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,960
This is the detailed map
of official water transport channels.

837
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,800
Yes.

838
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,400
How do you know I have it?

839
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,400
I am a good friend of Concubine Han.

840
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,280
She used to tell me

841
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,400
your ancestor used to work

842
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,710
as an official of the prior dynasty.

843
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,150
I also came to know that

844
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,320
the official channels

845
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,920
had been opened
by the Wei family of the prior dynasty.

846
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,670
That is why I thought of you.

847
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
I see.

848
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,190
Thank you very much

849
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,230
for it.

850
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,800
It is my gift for you.

851
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,360
Please accept it.

852
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,590
Okay, thank you!

853
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,800
