= Episode 1 =

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,860
After Rebellion of An and Shi,
Tang Dynasty,

33
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,700
there were political instability

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,290
and regional division among warlords.

35
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,520
Silver City located in Jiannan Dao was

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,630
immune to wars for its perilous passes.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,620
Considering the rich natural resources

38
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,690
in Central Sichuan,

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,370
Silver City thus became

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,680
a Mecca for silk and satin trade.

41
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,050
Diversified forces gathered here

42
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,750
and turned it into a melting pot.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,240
= Wanhua =
Wanhua was the dividing line

44
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,020
= Wanhua =
between Southern City and Northern City.

45
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,780
= Northern City Southern City =
There’re continuous battles between

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,460
= Northern City Southern City =
the upper class and the lower class.

47
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,220
Southern City

48
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,000
had an enormous gathering
of vulgarians and refugees

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,480
and thus was a place for the lower class.

50
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,420
Longzhu Gang and Snake Gang
were the two leading gangs here.

51
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,460
They had fought for leadership for years.

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,540
Therefore, both gangs agreed to

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,100
have a gamble at Wanhua to redefine

54
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,130
their territories and appease disputes

55
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,470
on the second day
of the second lunar month.

56
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,770
Great!

57
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,570
Great!

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,790
Great!

59
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,100
Come on, let’s go and see
what’s going on at Wanhua.

60
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,980
I almost forgot
today’s the Dragon Headraising Day.

61
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,820
It is said Longzhu Gang has a new leader.

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,220
I guess they will certainly

63
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,500
make a big deal in the gamble today.

64
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,940
Really? Let’s hurry there and have a look.

65
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,340
Go.

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,740
Let’s go.

67
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,700
= Wanhua =

68
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,260
You see, all the members
of the Snake Gang have arrived.

69
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,140
Where is the new leader then?

70
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,460
Don’t underestimate our new leader.

71
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,900
She really has great power.

72
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,580
If you don’t trust it,

73
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,300
just wait and see
how the Snake Gang will be defeated.

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,220
Our new gang leader used to be
just a small branch leader.

75
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,860
But she was handpicked
by our late leader as his successor.

76
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
She won over the support of most

77
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,940
gang members in just a few months.

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,020
Even our conceited Second Master Lyu

79
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,820
is completely submissive to her.

80
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,700
What a great leader she is!

81
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,220
Really marvelous!

82
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,300
Great leader?

83
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,380

88
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,660
It is time to see the real power
of the Snake Gang.

89
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,500
Go.

90
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,460

Hurry up. Go.

170
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,060
Xiaoqin.

171
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,180
Wait, Master is going to vomit.

172
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,580
Master, are you OK?

173
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,260
Brother!

174
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,820
Please, make way for me.

175
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,860
Brother?

176
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,620
Are you blind?

177
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,380
Uncle!

178
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,620
Who are you calling uncle?

179
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,220
I am still young. Do I look like an uncle?

180
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:13,820
Go ahead.

181
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Come on, come here.

182
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,380
No.

183
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,820
Here! Come!

184
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,300
Go.

185
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,380
Ugly woman!

186
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,980
You are the ugly one!

187
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,580
You will certainly pay for it today.

188
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,140
I will pay for it?

189
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,540
Xiaoqin.

190
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,940
- Xiaoqin.
- You occupied the road first.

191
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,900
- Yan Bin.
- How dare you blame me!

192
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,980
- Why is it so noisy?
- I occupied the road?

193
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,420
We arrived here first.

194
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,260
Can you be reasonable?

195
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:38,860
Master,

196
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,380
how about having breakfast first?

197
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,620
Let me deal with her first.

198
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,810
Welcome, Master Li.

199
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,620
This is our newly baked pastry.

200
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,700
= Longxiang Bakery =

201
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,420
Why set firecrackers in the daytime?

202
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,420
It’s Dragon Headraising Day today.

203
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,340
We need to rehearse it in advance.

204
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,660
What a rooster

205
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,140
you are indeed!

206
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,380
How dare you make fun of me!

207
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,340
Stop making troubles.

208
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,180
Let’s go.

209
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,100
Ready to lift the sedan.

210
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,180
= Long Aoyi, Master of Longzhu Gang =

211
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,140
Come here, Third Master Qiao, drink on.

212
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,420
Third Master Qiao,

213
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,140
drink on.

214
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,140
What a drunken beggar you are!

215
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,340
Don’t talk so much rubbish.

216
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,540
Cheers.

217
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,940
This cup is running away by itself.

218
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,660
Get down if you wake up.

219
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,060
How dare you

220
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,980
hide the liquor from me.

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,900
Let me drink it.

222
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,580
You are a girl.

223
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,020
Please behave yourself.

224
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,740
Third Master Qiao,

225
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,980
why did you suddenly become handsome?

226
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,940
Let me have a look.

227
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,140
- What a cruel bastard!
- What’s up with her?

228
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,220
Master!

229
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,260
Go way, there is nothing interesting here.

230
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:39,780
Go away!

231
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Where is Third Master Qiao?

232
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,020
Did he kick me just now?

233
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,900
Isn’t he drunk already?

234
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,660
Come on.

235
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,820
You will pay for it.

236
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,580
Watch out.

237
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,780
Here they are.

238
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,530
All the top priorities
of the Southern City and Northern City

239
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,380
are being done today.

240
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,900
Will there be any mistake?

241
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,300
Please be positive.

242
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,460
The battle is at the outer pavilion

243
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,360
and the silk show is
at the inner pavilion.

244
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,620
They don’t interfere with each other

245
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,380
and we collect money from both sides.

246
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,590
So beautiful.

247
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,150
So beautiful.

248
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,140
Thanks for your patronage

249
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,620
at our Xinsilu’s
Gold Thread Fashion Show today.

250
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,300
In the box in my hand,

251
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,340
is the Gold Thread of our Xinsilu.

252
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,100
Our Xinsilu’s Gold Thread

253
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,700
is unique in the market

254
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
for its exquisite skills and great value.

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,180
= Du Xiaoxian, Manager of Xinsilu =

256
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,300
= Du Xiaoxian, Manager of Xinsilu =
Master Li of Xinsilu will personally

257
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,700
display the gold-thread clothes

258
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,100
to you all soon.

259
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,060
Let’s wait and see.

260
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,820
Master Long! Master Long! Master Long!

261
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,460
Are you okay, Master?

262
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,240
Master Long! Master Long! Master Long!

263
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,730
Here.

264
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:25,640
Master Long! Master Long! Master Long!

265
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Master Long! Master Long! Master Long!

266
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,580
Is such a young girl

267
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,220
the new master of Longzhu Gang?

268
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,100
She is so short.

269
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,340
Are you playing a joke?

270
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,620
Just a joke.

271
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,460
Do you think I am short?

272
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,060
It must be high enough this way.

273
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,940
Master Long!

274
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:25,300
Master Long! Master Long! Master Long!

275
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,460
Sorry for it.

276
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,780
I am Long Aoyi.

277
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,620
As you all know,

278
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,140
in the Southern City,

279
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,580
Longzhu Gang and Snake Gang

280
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,220
haven’t interfered with each other.

281
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,140
Longzhu Gang is in charge of
drink, food, magic and opera

282
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,900
while Snake Gang is in charge of
theft, gambling and tobacco.

283
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,780
As there have been
frequent misunderstandings these days,

284
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,660
we must deal with them directly today.

285
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,060
How do you think about it?

286
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,020
Good! Good! Good!

287
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,020
Qingliu, how handsome!

288
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,580
Qingliu! Qingliu! Qingliu!

289
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,340
It is a copy of the imperial clothing.

290
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,940
The technique of gold threading

291
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,540
is different from the prior technique
of gilding,

292
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,180
outlining and weaving.

293
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,380
It takes forty-nine days to make the

294
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,630
embroidered pattern of carp and pearl.

295
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,750
So beautiful!

296
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,700
It seems there is no doubt about

297
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,540
the champion of silk stores this year.

298
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,260
Next, Master Li will introduce it
in details to you.

299
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,900
Get started. Winner of two games
will be the final winner.

300
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,940
The one with more credits
will win each game.

301
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,100
The winner has the right to get over

302
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,260
one of the five businesses from the loser.

303
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,660
Let’s start the first game.

304
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,060
Master Long.

305
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,820
Please.

306
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,340
Baozi, the take-it-all,

307
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,060
Longzhu Gang is the winner of Game 1.

308
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,540
Great job!

309
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,420
Master Long! Master Long! Master Long!

310
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,340
Wait a minute.

311
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,060
Small cup is for kids only.

312
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,580
Replace it with a liquor jar.

313
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,140
It relies on strength to play it in a jar.

314
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,820
Don’t play a trick with our master.

315
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,380
Go back if you aren’t qualified for it.

316
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,100
How can a small girl act as the master

317
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,260
before having enough power for it?

318
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,780
You…

319
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,900
I think Qiyan’s idea

320
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,780
is very interesting.

321
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,940
Anyone whose dice drops out of the jar

322
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,100
will be the loser
regardless of the points.

323
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,500
Master, we can’t lose this game.

324
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
Great!

325
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,900
Great!

326
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,220
- Master!
- Master!

327
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,900
Gold-thread clothes will bring…

328
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,780
What’s happening?

329
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,940
What happened?

330
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,700
Xinsilu is going to suffer this time.

331
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
What’s going on?

332
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,820
What an accident!

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,340
You… You…

334
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,220
What are you doing?

335
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,500
What’s wrong?

336
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,060
Let me down.

337
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,180
Let me down.

338
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,060
How dare you be so rude to me!
You must pay for it.

339
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,660
You profiteer! I’ll let you pay!

340
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,820
When I am down…

341
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,220
Fish with Pearl. Pearl in Dragon.

342
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,300
A red carp that brews the fortune
of the Tang Dynasty.

343
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,820
How creative it is!

344
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,460
This is a stage specially designed
by Master Li for you all.

345
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,260
It displays the gold-thread material

346
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,620
that matches any fabric.

347
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,740
- Qingliu!
- Great job!

348
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,340
Our boss said

349
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,380
in their state,

350
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,300
cherry is only for the most distinguished.

351
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,700
We hope to order three thousand

352
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,460
gold-thread apparels of limited edition
from your store.

353
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,660
= Silver City =

354
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,980
Stop!

355
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,260
How dare you

356
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,460
enter the city with a knife on you!

357
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,220
= Zhao =

358
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,420
= Li Zhao, Sixth son of the emperor =
I am sorry. I beg your pardon!

359
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,260
Let us through right away!

360
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,460
Put me down, profiteer!

361
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,380
Put me down, profiteer!

362
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,980
Put me down, profiteer!

363
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,820
You were too carried away on stage.

364
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,740
Just wait and see.

365
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,020
I will punish you after I get down.

366
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,380
You finally know how to respect a girl.

367
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,260
You should have known it earlier.

368
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,740
Don’t get me wrong.

369
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,980
Put away the Persian carpet below.

370
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,500
If it is stained with blood,
you must pay with your salary.

371
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,500
What a stupid guy you are!

372
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,060
My blood is less valuable
than the crappy carpet?

373
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,260
Wait and see.

374
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,060
Yan Bin,

375
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,940
go get some silver ingots

376
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,140
to dismiss this drunkard.

377
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,140
What’s going on out there? So noisy.

378
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,660
Yan Bin said

379
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,300
the two big gangs of the lower class

380
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,860
are fighting fiercely for small money.

381
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,140
I didn’t expect the lower-class gangs
could also enter Wanhua.

382
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,580
It is a shame for us.

383
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,260
It doesn’t matter.

384
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,420
The Snake Gang has always
secretly controlled the supply of silk.

385
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,620
The setback this time

386
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,300
will help to lower the price of silk.

387
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,740
I hope so.

388
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,260
Let’s sign the contract
with the Persian merchant.

389
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,700
Let’s wait and see.

390
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,820
Master, are you okay?

391
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,620
How talented you are!

392
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,260
You managed to come back

393
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,860
after hanging around.

394
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,980
As we agreed just now,

395
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,320
you are the loser as your dice

396
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,880
dropped out of the jar.

397
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,940
One to one, it is a draw.

398
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,100
The last game will be the break point.

399
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,300
Two masters, please put in your chips.

400
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,260
Qiyan.

401
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,020
Let’s place a greater chip

402
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,660
on this game.

403
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,220
Show me

404
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,060
what a big chip you prefer on it.

405
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,900
Just one business isn’t a big chip at all.

406
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,340
I would bet

407
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,960
all the businesses of Longzhu Gang.

408
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,060
If you win, all the five businesses
will be yours.

409
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,570
It is interesting.

410
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,840
Really interesting!

411
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,380
But, what if you lose?

412
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,910
If I lose,

413
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,790
all the five businesses of the Snake Gang

414
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,740
will be yours.

415
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,610
What do you mean?

416
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,300
The silkworms in the box

417
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,060
are local silkworms of Silver City.

418
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,340
They have much better quality
than those distributed by the government.

419
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,220
A local silkworm farmer
can make much more money a year

420
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,750
and thus feed at least two more people.

421
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,620
But now,

422
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,110
you just betray the silkworm farmers.

423
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,360
Qiyan,

424
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,980
you have grown up in the Silver City.

425
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,620
You know mulberry and silkworm are

426
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,260
the source of daily bread for our people.

427
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,920
It has nothing to do with you.

428
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,620
Listen,

429
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,340
I don’t care about your businesses.

430
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,460
Give me the silkworm business if you lose.

431
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,740
Master, never do it.

432
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,780
It is related to silk supply
to the upper society.

433
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,420
Shut up.

434
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,260
Bet with her.

435
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,590
Never regret.

436
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,100
= Northern Street of Silver City =
Come on! Hurry up!

437
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,700
It is said Longzhu Gang bet

438
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,980
all its businesses for the game today.

439
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,540
Really?

440
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,740
Do they still wish to make it

441
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,980
a life-or-death game with the Snake Gang?

442
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,060
You don’t understand it.

443
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,700
Longzhu Gang is doing it for the benefit

444
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,420
of all silkworm farmers of Silver City.

445
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,060
They want to get back
the local silkworm supply

446
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,460
- controlled by the Snake Gang for years.
- Stop.

447
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,790
Really? Let’s hurry there and have a look.

448
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,900
Let’s go.

449
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,820
Wu Lin.

450
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,260
Why are people talking about the gangs?

451
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,390
Why do they care about them so much?

452
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,980
How does the gamble matter?

453
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,060
= Wu Lin, Royal guard =
Your Highness, let’s go and have a look?

454
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,700
Listen, what should you call me
outside Chang’an?

455
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,460
Mr. Zhao.

456
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,240
Go.

457
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,300
Go to Wanhua.

458
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,740
Go.

459
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,420
Master, look at the man in black.

460
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,380
He is Executive Bai
of Salt and Iron Bureau.

461
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,460
This corrupt official has taken away

462
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,580
so many illegal gains
via his taxing power.

463
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,140
Our merchants have to pay extra taxes

464
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,840
for any output of silk.

465
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,220
Since Master Long is
really a generous person,

466
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,900
I must do my own part too.

467
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,540
I will add forty thousand taels of silver
as chips for the last game.

468
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,540
Master Long, please follow.

469
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,740
Bastard! I didn’t expect him to cheat me.

470
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,020
He must have plotted it earlier

471
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,980
and betted so much money against me.

472
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,100
Hurry back and see

473
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,740
what valuables we have.

474
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,140
Hurry.

475
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,980
Master, you know what we have back.

476
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,620
All our valuables are evidently there.

477
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,020
If you can’t follow suit,

478
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,580
Longzhu Gang will lose the last game.

479
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,660
What niggards you are!

480
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,020
You aren’t qualified to be a gang.

481
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
You shouldn’t be called “Longzhu Gang”!

482
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,620
You should be called “Zhugan Gang”!

483
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,130
Yes, Zhugan Gang!

484
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:44,420
Zhugan Gang!

485
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,820
Master Long,

486
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,620
may I join you?

487
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,620
Isn’t that the master of Xinsilu?

488
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,780
Yes, why is he here?

489
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,940
Great to see you here, Master Li.

490
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,100
But the upper and lower societies
have always been separate from each other.

491
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,300
So, what do you mean, Master Li?

492
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,900
I am sorry

493
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,500
for what I did

494
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,340
in the inner pavilion just now.

495
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,540
No deal is clenched in a forced manner.

496
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,060
I didn’t expect Long Aoyi
had been waiting for business here.

497
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,100
I am sorry. I don’t need it.

498
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,500
Just go away if you have nothing special.

499
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,780
I can give you a hand

500
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,900
and help you win the game.

501
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,660
But, nobody will do a losing business.

502
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,500
If you win, I will share
half of the business.

503
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,860
What a robber you are!

504
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,620
What are you talking about in whispers?

505
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,580
Profiteer!

506
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,340
Don’t blackmail me.

507
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,020
I won’t flatter you. I can bear it myself.

508
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,700
Okay, bye.

509
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,900
If Master Long can’t follow suit,

510
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,060
the gamble will end up with two to one.

511
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,220
The Snake Gang will be the final winner.

512
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,620
Come back.

513
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,660
I agree.

514
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,500
But listen,

515
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,740
the business can be shared equally.

516
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,100
But I am the decision-maker on silkworm.

517
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,660
There is no other choice.

518
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,760
Yan Bin.

519
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,860
Miss Du.

520
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,980
Where is Qingliu?

521
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,020
He has gone back first.

522
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,140
Tell Qingliu

523
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
I am going back first.

524
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,740
Keep an eye on the delivery
of gold thread tonight.

525
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,180
Yes.

526
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,740
Got it.

527
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,380
= Title Deed =

528
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,420
= Title Deed =
Five title deeds of Xinsilu.

529
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,480
= Title Deed =
All are located in the Northern City,

530
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,620
= Title Deed =
with a covering area of two hundred Mu.

531
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,340
= Title Deed =
What a big fortune it is!

532
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,170
Exactly.

533
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,220
Five pieces!

534
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:08,970
Five pieces of title deeds.

535
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,300
What a big fortune!

536
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,010
= Title Deed =
It is worth at least

537
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,520
= Title Deed =
some hundred thousand taels of silver.

538
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,940
Exactly.

539
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,460
Why is our richest man
together with Master Long?

540
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,780
I never heard about it.

541
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,900
That’s right.

542
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,380
Do you mean...

543
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,780
My chip is too big?

544
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,100
Your Snake Gang can’t follow suit
this time?

545
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,340
How about…

546
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
Just admitting defeat?

547
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,140
Forget it.

548
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,340
Well,

549
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,540
what I predicted has come true.

550
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,100
Qiyan

551
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,420
is just a coward of discredit.

552
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,180
Everyone in the Silver City knows it.

553
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,700
The silkworm business is
under the government’s strict control

554
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,380
and the price is not high.

555
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,520
Now,

556
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,740
I didn’t expect anyone to secretly sell

557
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,380
silkworm eggs overseas and create

558
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,500
a black market,

559
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,260
resulting in that the silkworm farmers
can’t even make a living.

560
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,660
It is a fraud against all our neighbors.

561
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,700
I can’t tolerate it.

562
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,660
I agree on

563
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,780
all you said.

564
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,060
Moreover,

565
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,060
you constructed private houses,

566
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,060
ran casinos and tobacco houses,

567
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,050
and did all the appealing things.

568
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,340
Appalling things.

569
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,780
Coward?

570
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,620
Yes!

571
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,340
You are just a coward!

572
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,700
You flatter and play servant
to the government.

573
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,940
I can never torture this gamble.

574
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,650
Tolerate this gamble.

575
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,780
Have I put it right?

576
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,580
Almost.

577
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,700
That is okay.

578
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,220
What a despicable couple you are!

579
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,940
Two against one, right?

580
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,320
Let me tell you,

581
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,940
I am never afraid of anything!

582
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,660
Come on.

583
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,500
They showed no respect to me.

584
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,220
Give it to me.

585
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,200
Listen,

586
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,540
give it to me

587
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,680
or our silkworm business will be busted.

588
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,260
Hurry.

589
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,100
Give it to me.

590
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,330
I use it as a chip against you.

591
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,580
= Silk Token =

592
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,940
It finally appeared.

593
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,500
This token is equivalent
to three years’ silk tax.

594
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,860
Only three families have it in the city.

595
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,460
It has the same value

596
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,300
as your chip.

597
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,380
Get started.

598
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,860
But throwing dices

599
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:19,980
isn’t exciting enough.

600
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,980
Let’s do something new.

601
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,580
Good.

602
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,900
I agree.

603
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,940
Why does Master Long
have to change the way of gambling now?

604
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:36,870
Master Long!

605
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,340
Hey, man!

606
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,380
Could you tell me their identities?

607
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,620
You mustn’t be a native.

608
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,460
This is the master of Longzhu Gang.

609
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,710
Master Long! Master Long! Master Long!

610
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,460
Boy, come here.

611
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,350
May I exchange this silver ingot
with your bowl?

612
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,820
Promise me.

613
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,780
Use this silver ingot to buy

614
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,060
a piece of new clothes
for each of your brothers

615
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,900
and have a haircut.

616
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,340
It is the Dragon Headraising Day today.

617
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,500
As the dragon raises its head,
you should too.

618
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,060
Thank you, sister.

619
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,520
You are welcome.

620
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,860
Qiyan,

621
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,260
do you remember this?

622
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,260
Let’s use this bowl for a gamble today.

623
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,620
What gamble can it be

624
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,420
with the broken bowl of a beggar?

625
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,740
Wrap it up in a piece of cloth
and smash it.

626
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,220
Count the fragments
and guess if it is an odd or even number.

627
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,060
Okay?

628
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,300
Well…

629
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,580
You were really heroic just now.

630
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,740
There is still time for you
to admit defeat.

631
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,900
If you win,

632
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,420
you will be sole owner
of the lower classes in the Silver City.

633
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,460
Will you bet on it?

634
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:47,860
Yes.

635
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,940
I will.

636
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,740
Start.

637
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,660
Even.

638
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,500
I guess it is even.

639
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,220
No.

640
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,380
We must take turns.

641
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,020
If I also bet on an even number,

642
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,260
the gamble will just be invalid
regardless of the result.

643
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,380
Whoever starts will be the first.

644
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,820
Don’t take me as a fool.

645
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,620
Fine.

646
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,660
It is at your convenience this time.

647
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,860
I bet on an odd number.

648
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,660
One.

649
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,460
Two.

650
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,020
Three.

651
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,540
Four.

652
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,340
Five.

653
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,580
Six.

654
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,340
Seven.

655
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,100
Eight.

656
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,340
Nine.

657
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,360
We won! We won! We won!

658
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,000
Nine fragments!

659
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,690
Wonderful!

660
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,290
We won!

661
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,020
- Wait!
- We won…

662
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,980
I must count it personally.

663
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,860
Interesting, very interesting.

664
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,700
Wu Lin, go and check Master Long.

665
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,380
Also that person. Check them both.

666
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:16,700
Yes.

667
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,100
Master.

668
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,780
We won. We won. We won.

669
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:34,040
- Master Long!
- We won! Master! Master Long!

670
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,340
Even a child knows
not to forget the origin.

671
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,540
You called it a broken bowl
at first sight.

672
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,980
I know you have forgotten your origin.

673
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,900
In the drought over ten years ago,

674
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,260
every family in the Silver City
had a lotus bowl like this for begging.

675
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,420
Haven’t you used this bowl for begging?

676
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,100
Look at it carefully with your eyes.

677
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,060
All lotus bowls have

678
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,140
a lotus shape with nine petals.

679
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,300
A bowl with nine petals

680
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,220
will most probably

681
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,380
be broken into fragments of an odd number.

682
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,220
- The master has won!
- Great!

683
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:20,020
- Master Long!
- Master Long has won!

684
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,300
Come on, bros,

685
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,230
= Silk Token =
We must

686
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,530
have a good drink today.

687
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,220
All right!

688
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,260
We won! We won!

689
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,980
= Title Deed =

690
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,700
= Commercial Title Deed =

691
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,060
Master, look at these!

692
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,100
How could you use these as title deeds!

693
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,980
You lost this game!

694
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,820
What?

695
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,100
Well, these are…

696
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,260
How dare you conspire

697
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,860
with a swindler to cheat me!

698
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,220
Listen, my bros of the Snake Gang,

699
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,300
let’s get to the fighting!

700
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,060
Go get them.

701
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,780
Xiaoqin!

702
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,900
Be careful, Your Highness!

703
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,020
Catch that dude!

704
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,780
Let’s go, Your Highness!

705
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,540
- Let’s go!
- Don’t run away!

706
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,860
Stop, you profiteer!

707
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,380
There is no escape for you.

708
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,900
Stop there!

709
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,820
How dare you take away my properties!

710
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
Return the silver ingots
and silkworm eggs.

711
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,420
Let go.

712
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,900
Give them back to me.

713
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,900
I didn’t expect the rich guy of Xinsilu

714
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,180
would steal such little money

715
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,940
in such a despicable way.

716
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,180
Shame on you!

717
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,660
I just want one single article.

718
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,260
Nothing for you.

719
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,700
You owe me this time.

720
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,900
It is a draw now.

721
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,900
Let go. Let go.

722
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,780
You let go.

723
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
= Liquor =

724
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,060
I heard a sound here just now.

725
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:34,860
Go and search.

726
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,540
Follow me.

727
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,740
Master.

728
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,180
My liquor will be wasted.

729
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,460
What a pity!

730
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,260
Mater Qi.

731
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,140
Please,

732
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,500
it is my private cellar under here.

733
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,460
Nobody knows it. There is nobody in it.

734
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,490
Listen,

735
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,980
I will send you some jars of liquor later.

736
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,380
Let’s go. I will be waiting for you.

737
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,500
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

738
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,190
Mind your steps, Master Qi.

739
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,260
= Du’s Mansion =

740
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,860
= Du’s Mansion =

741
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,740
Your Highness!

742
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,180
I apologize

743
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,540
for not having received you well.

744
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,260
= Du Changfeng, Commissioner of Jiannan Dao =
Your Highness, please.

745
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,660
Do you know why I have come to the

746
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,820
Silver City as Envoy
of Salt and Iron Bureau?

747
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,380
I heard the tax corruptions had worsened

748
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,700
continuously in Jiannan Dao recently.

749
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,660
Your Highness is well informed.

750
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,180
You have visited the Silver City

751
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,980
as Envoy of Salt and Iron Bureau
from the Central Government.

752
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,900
I will certainly be at your full service.

753
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,780
You sound like a loyal official,

754
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,700
Mr. Du.

755
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,420
But I saw officials of the Silver City

756
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,380
gambling publicly with tokens

757
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,100
at Wanhua today.

758
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,620
It is really out of expectation.

759
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:09,860
Your Highness!

760
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,780
There must be some misunderstandings.

761
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,930
I will check strictly with Your Highness.

762
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,460
Never mind.

763
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,180
I am tired today.

764
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,900
I have asked my daughter to arrange
for your accommodation.

765
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,780
She is a careful and good-tempered girl.

766
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,420
Please ask for her assistance

767
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,500
during your stay in the Silver City.

768
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,620
Thanks for your consideration,

769
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,300
Mr. Du.

770
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,300
Your Highness, please.

771
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:46,580
You…

772
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,100
There is no escape for you.

773
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,100
I won this game against Qiyan.

774
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,700
The chips are certainly mine.

775
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,740
You wouldn’t have won it without me.

776
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,340
Yes,

777
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,780
you really made your contributions.

778
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,480
But…

779
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,340
Frankly,

780
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,900
I may look so honored

781
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,980
as the gang master outside.

782
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,660
But I have many brothers and sisters

783
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,500
to feed back home.

784
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,380
I have been making daily breads
since my childhood.

785
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,380
I get up early

786
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,940
and go to bed late.

787
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,780
I am always hungry.

788
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,580
I also have to sell bean curd.

789
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,540
I have no parents.

790
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,100
I am just a young girl.

791
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,980
It is never easy for me to work

792
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,740
with a gang of men day in and day out.

793
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,900
Actually, I have something else
to tell you.

794
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,740
