32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,510
The morning court begins!

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Long live Your Majesty!

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,960
You may rise.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,840
I feel less energetic than before.

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,920
I only hope that the Tang people

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
can be like real brothers and sisters

38
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,560
who love each other.

39
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,510
My children

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,070
help each other.

41
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,890
Prince Zhao and Prince Jun

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,350
assist the Crown Prince conscientiously

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,090
to govern Tang well.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,070
Your Majesty, you are the true emperor

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,640
and in the prime of your life,

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,560
you will stay healthy and strong.

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,560
Long live Your Majesty.

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,920
You may rise.

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,000
If there is no more report,

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,640
then the morning court will end.

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
- I have something to report.
- I have something to report.

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,950
Father.

54
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,230
What I’m going to say

55
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,050
concerns the safety of the nation.

56
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,370
Okay, Prince Zhao.

57
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,070
You go ahead first.

58
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,560
Father.

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,400
I want to accuse
a concubine of conspiracy.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,480
Who?

61
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,510
Concubine De.

62
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,470
How could it happen?

63
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
What’s going on?

64
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,870
Prince Zhao, are you sure?

65
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,520
Concubine De is your mother.

66
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,030
Prince Zhao.

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,470
Don’t talk nonsense.

68
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,910
Your Majesty,

69
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,750
Prince Zhao has been
suffering from serious sickness.

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,000
He is semi-conscious.

71
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,520
He always talks gibberish.

72
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,910
Let me take him down for treatment.

73
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,150
Prince Zhao. Prince Zhao!

74
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,360
Hold on.

75
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,560
Prince Zhao.

76
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,840
What’s the crime of Concubine De?

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,470
Since Concubine De

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,280
entered the Palace,
she has committed many murders,

79
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,030
including the royal family members

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,400
Empress Dugu,

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Princess Huayang who
died young in Taoist Temple,

82
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Prince Jun’s biological mother Cui,

83
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,590
and the future emperor of Tang,

84
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,000
the Crown Prince.

85
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,520
What?

86
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,400
I have something to say.

87
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,360
Prince Zhao,

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,710
go on.

89
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,000
Concubine De

90
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
hates your

91
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,310
beloved concubine and princess,

92
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,800
so she killed them.

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,120
She is dissatisfied with
the Crown Prince being the future emperor,

94
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
so she tries to kill him

95
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,110
and puts poison on his personal objects.

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Therefore,

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,590
the Crown Prince has been weak
since childhood

98
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,160
and suffering from serious illness.

99
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,850
But...

100
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,630
But they checked my diet,

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,280
the physicians did not find anything.

102
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,080
Of course they can’t find it.

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,800
Because the poisoned object

104
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,930
is this.

105
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,370
Sacrifice Concubine De to save him.

106
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,150
And also

107
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,910
what happened to Prince Jun in mausoleum

108
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,400
was done by Concubine De.

109
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,470
We found malm

110
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,280
only for building mausoleum

111
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,470
from the Shence Army

112
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,560
who protect Concubine De,

113
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,190
which proves that Concubine De

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,910
damaged the mausoleum.

115
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,960
Are you sure

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,360
about what you said?

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,190
Prince Zhao.

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,630
Concubine De cares about you,

119
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
it’s fine that you don’t
pay your filial duties,

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,680
but you even slander your mother in court!

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,000
Please investigate it, Father.

122
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I am guilty.

123
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,120
Please punish me.

124
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,560
Bring Concubine De here.

125
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,980
Summon Concubine De!

126
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,160
Greetings to Your Majesty.

127
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
Is what Prince Zhao

128
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,750
said true?

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,390
All he said is true.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,570
This is...

131
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,070
Quiet!

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,000
Your Majesty.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,360
What Concubine De committed

134
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,310
is unforgivable.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,560
I think Concubine De
should be given death penalty.

136
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,570
And Prince Zhao

137
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,480
should be abolished

138
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,950
and driven out of the Palace.

139
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,120
Counselor Pang

140
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
should be dismissed and exiled.

141
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,240
No.

142
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,000
Your Majesty.

143
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,920
Prince Zhao exposed Concubine De’s crimes,

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
he has made amends.

145
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,750
As for the crimes of Concubine De,

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
we need to investigate carefully.

147
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,070
We can’t wrong her

148
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,070
or let her get away from the punishment.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Therefore, I think

150
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,630
Concubine De should be imprisoned
in Court of the Imperial Clan.

151
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,270
We can convict her later.

152
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,870
Pass on my order.

153
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,560
Imprison Concubine De

154
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
and the rest of her henchmen immediately
and confiscate their property.

155
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,000
Abolish Prince Zhao as common people.

156
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,680
Imprison Counselor Pang
in Court of Judicial Review.

157
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,390
Close down Pang’s Mansion.

158
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,270
The Crown Prince will handle it.

159
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,510
Yes, Father.

160
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

161
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
= Forever Love By Emperor Daizong =

162
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,600
Are you here to laugh at me?

163
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,070
Listen.

164
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,510
His Majesty won’t kill me.

165
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Even if I die

166
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,310
and there is only a skeleton left,

167
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,360
I’m still more prominent

168
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,000
and noble than

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,120
you two bastards.

170
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,680
Did you kill my master?

171
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,510
What does

172
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,120
the fancy carp mean?

173
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,680
I have killed countless people.

174
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,390
If you want me to make a list,

175
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,870
I’m afraid I can’t finish it
within ten days and ten nights.

176
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

177
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,630
I killed them all.

178
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,070
So what?

179
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,150
You killed His Majesty’s

180
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,720
beloved Cui and Dugu.

181
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,630
You also want to
pull the Crown Prince down.

182
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,750
But Princess Huayang was so young,

183
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,720
how could you do it?

184
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,200
You did all the bad things,

185
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,390
aren’t you not guilty at all?

186
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,240
Can you still fall asleep?

187
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Are you not afraid of harming
the happiness of your future generations?

188
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,790
If I’m not living well,

189
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,240
nobody will!

190
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,550
I know

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,870
I was never

192
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,510
the most important person for His Majesty.

193
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,270
But it does not matter.

194
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,550
I knew it clearly.

195
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,240
Do you know what you need

196
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,630
to live beautifully

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,030
in the Palace?

198
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You need power!

199
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,960
With power,

200
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,870
our Pang family can enjoy wealth forever.

201
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,270
But you guys

202
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,000
have to fight against me.

203
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,840
And you

204
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
seduce my Zhao.

205
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,630
You should be killed!

206
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,630
You should all be killed!

207
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,270
You should be killed!

208
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,550
Kill!

209
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,910
Kill you all!

210
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,980
= Deceased Mother
Spirit Tablet of Lady Cui =

211
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,100
= Deceased Mother
Spirit Tablet of Lady Cui =

212
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,960
Her Grace can finally rest in peace.

213
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,720
Mother.

214
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,120
You must have blessed me in heaven.

215
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,750
Your grievances finally come to light.

216
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,870
But it’s too long ago

217
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,720
and we couldn’t find your bones

218
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,390
and bury you well.

219
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Today, I swear in front of your spirit.

220
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,030
I will only

221
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,910
marry Long

222
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,510
and take care of her forever.

223
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,080
I will never fail her.

224
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,960
When will we return to Silver City?

225
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,200
We should pay homage to your master

226
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,480
and let her rest in peace.

227
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,550
No.

228
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,720
It’s not that simple.

229
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,080
It doesn’t look like

230
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,000
Concubine De knows the fancy carp.

231
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,480
She didn’t have any response

232
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,480
when she heard my master’s name.

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,960
My master won’t say
meaningless words to me,

234
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,120
and won’t leave me useless clues.

235
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,150
Would it be that Concubine De

236
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,880
killed too many people and forgot it

237
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,910
as she said?

238
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,550
So I used words to make her talk.

239
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,390
She knows clearly about

240
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
your mother, the late empress
and the Princess.

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,150
But she didn’t mention
a word about my master.

242
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,200
And it’s only half a year,

243
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,390
it’s impossible that she forgot it.

244
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,150
I think

245
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,270
there must be something that

246
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
we don’t know.

247
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,840
But who would that person be?

248
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,550
Are you satisfied now?

249
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,750
Long Aoyi must think

250
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,320
I am the murderer who killed her master.

251
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,390
This is what you should do.

252
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,480
It has been a mutually beneficial
relationship for us.

253
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,790
Your Pang family do things for me,

254
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
I help you make Prince Zhao
ascend the throne.

255
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,750
Didn’t the Pang family do enough

256
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,750
for you?

257
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,630
You control Du Changfeng

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,150
and the Ministry of War.

259
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,550
My brother and I

260
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,270
have done countless
illegal things for you.

261
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,670
But once something goes wrong,

262
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
you just push us out.

263
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,750
Prime Minister,

264
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,320
you do play the cards well.

265
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,270
Your Grace, you told me

266
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,630
you have taken care of these things.

267
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,820
= The lips should be able
to take back the food. =

268
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,960
It was found when they
searched your residence.

269
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,640
Fortunately, two minions found it.

270
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,070
What to do with them?

271
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,960
Do you need me to teach you?

272
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,320
You broke the rules first.

273
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,360
Your Highness.

274
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,960
Why are you sitting on the ground?
Don’t catch a cold.

275
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,270
Your Highness, eat something.

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,670
You didn’t have anything
in the last three days.

277
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,150
You...

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,510
What if your health is harmed?

279
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,270
I met Eunuch Zhai
from Prime Minister’s Mansion

280
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,670
on my way here.

281
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,840
He asked you to clean up
after you have the meal

282
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,870
and go to see Concubine De.

283
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,080
If you lie to me,

284
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,390
I won’t spare you when I am a ghost.

285
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,960
Don’t worry, Your Grace.

286
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Only when you die,

287
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,000
will His Majesty

288
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,630
wipe out the crimes of you and Prince Zhao

289
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,030
for the sake of his feelings for you.

290
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,750
And then I can

291
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,840
help Prince Zhao ascend the throne.

292
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,940
Your Grace, you have to think about

293
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,630
what to say and

294
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,840
what not to say later.

295
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,960
Prince Zhao’s safety

296
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,360
depends on your mouth.

297
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,870
Rest assured.

298
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
I know how to do.

299
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,000
Mother!

300
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,150
Prime Minister, thank you for
letting us see each other!

301
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,630
Sorry, Mother!

302
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,600
Zhao, come here.

303
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,000
Mother.

304
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,510
In the Palace, the mother’s honor
increases as her son’s position rises.

305
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,000
If you don’t give me out,

306
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,870
you will get yourself in trouble

307
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,790
and get yourself killed.

308
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,080
Besides,

309
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,600
I forced you to do it.

310
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,150
Zhao.

311
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,150
You are a good boy.

312
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,200
You are brilliant

313
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,080
and courageous.

314
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,360
Unfortunately,

315
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,870
you are too soft-hearted.

316
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
It’s my fault.

317
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,360
I should have made Li Qingliu...

318
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,390
You won’t end up like this.

319
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,750
Now I understand it.

320
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,910
I understand the efforts
you and Uncle made.

321
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,000
I know my fault.

322
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,550
You must remember my words.

323
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,580
Now,

324
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,790
either he dies or you die.

325
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,630
You can’t be indecisive,

326
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,750
generous,

327
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,880
or show mercy to
Long Aoyi and Li Qingliu.

328
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,800
I...

329
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,070
Prince Zhao.

330
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,400
Her Grace is investigated

331
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,870
because Long Aoyi set a trap.

332
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,590
But why would she

333
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,270
be so cruel

334
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,510
about my mother?

335
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,880
Who else but Li Qingliu?

336
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,070
Right now, only Prime Minister

337
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,960
can save you

338
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
and bring down Li Qingliu.

339
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,480
Zhao.

340
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,680
You can’t act rashly now.

341
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,590
You have to

342
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,240
listen to Prime Minster.

343
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,390
I...

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,030
Mother... I...

345
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,640
Come here.

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,350
Let me take a good look at you.

347
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,750
You lost so much weight

348
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,070
in these days.

349
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,440
Mother!

350
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Mother, what’s wrong with you?

351
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,580
Physician!

352
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,750
Physician!

353
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,030
It’s too late.

354
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,510
Prince Zhao.

355
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,070
Her Grace gives up her life for you.

356
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,510
That’s all because of Long Aoyi
and Prince Jun.

357
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,110
You must never

358
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,070
fail her again.

359
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,200
Mother.

360
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,640
Your grandfather gave it to me

361
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,480
when I got married.

362
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,070
He hoped your uncle and I

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,240
can achieve something in the Palace

364
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,310
and keep making our

365
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,480
Pang family strong.

366
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,790
Now I give it to you.

367
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,720
From now on,

368
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,110
this hairpin is like me.

369
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,070
Zhao.

370
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,240
Promise me

371
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,590
you will revenge for me.

372
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,880
You have to swear to me.

373
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,310
Mother.

374
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,720
I swear

375
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,590
Li Qingliu will die.

376
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,920
And also,

377
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,110
Long Aoyi.

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,070
This is my good Zhao.

379
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,750
Mother.

380
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,110
Mother!

381
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,030
Mother!

382
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,830
Mother!

383
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,000
Mother!

384
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,030
Mother!

385
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Mother!

386
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,440
Mother!

387
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
I heard last night

388
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,200
there were officials of
Court of Judicial Review

389
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,200
gathering outside Concubine De’s palace.

390
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,250
Decree from His Majesty,

391
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,700
Concubine De died last night.

392
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,440
The morning court is canceled,
please go back.

393
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,300
= Tang rules all the land =

394
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,960
Greetings to Father.

395
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,360
Qingliu, you are here.

396
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,750
Come here.

397
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,440
These beautiful

398
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
lands in front of you

399
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,550
are all mine.

400
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
They all think

401
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,720
becoming my woman

402
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,490
will assure them of
a lifetime of prosperity

403
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,470
and being respected.

404
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,470
But do you think

405
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,920
they are happy?

406
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,680
When your mother Zhenzhu died,

407
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,600
I was not by her side.

408
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,750
Now Concubine De is dead,

409
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,230
I was not by her side, either.

410
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,160
Will they blame me?

411
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,440
Father.

412
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,030
They are gone. Please don’t be sad.

413
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,510
Sad?

414
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,680
You don’t know.

415
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,510
The Emperor is passionate

416
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,400
but also fickle.

417
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,260
Now I have

418
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,890
made an explanation to your mother.

419
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,500
I guess she won’t

420
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,580
blame me

421
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,930
when we meet again.

422
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,060
= Prince Zhao’s Mansion =

423
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,170
They are all swayed easily by the wind.

424
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,450
They only see advantages
and avoid disadvantages.

425
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,450
Except for the Prime Minister,

426
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,260
those courtiers

427
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,850
all rush to deal with
those poisonous papers

428
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,340
for the Crown Prince.

429
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,890
Or they get together around Prince Jun!

430
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,580
When the dragon leaves water,

431
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,500
even ants can step on it.

432
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,740
Aren’t all the people
in the Palace like that?

433
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,610
Only you

434
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,130
are still by my side.

435
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,650
Prince Zhao.

436
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,890
Master Long?

437
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,020
Lady Long.

438
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,610
What are you doing here?

439
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,410
I want to talk to Prince Zhao in private.

440
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,020
Please excuse us for a second.

441
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,130
Where is he?

442
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,020
Why doesn’t he come with you?

443
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,450
Is he satisfied now?

444
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,650
I am worried about you.

445
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,020
Qingliu is also shocked by

446
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,690
the death of Concubine De.

447
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,850
Shocked.

448
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,740
The criminal Concubine De was malicious

449
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,850
and killed his mother.

450
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,930
Isn’t he angry? Doesn’t he blame me?

451
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,930
What Concubine De did
has nothing to do with you.

452
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,300
I hope you can
pull yourself together soon.

453
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,060
Are you here to comfort me?

454
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,210
Listen,

455
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,690
I don’t need it.

456
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,020
I want my mother

457
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,850
to be alive by my side.

458
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,100
Not just a cold relic.

459
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,690
How can I not understand your sadness?

460
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,890
That’s how my master died in my arms.

461
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,980
Nothing is permanent in life.

462
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,650
Sorry for your loss.

463
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,340
Go away.

464
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,210
I don’t need your pretense.

465
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,780
I will come to see you later.

466
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,100
By the way,

467
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,580
have you

468
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,170
ever seen any fancy carp

469
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,340
on Concubine De?

470
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,820
What are you doing?

471
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,500
Fancy carp?

472
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,780
You killed my mother

473
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,020
for Li Qingliu.

474
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,340
Now you are here

475
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,850
to ask me for my mother’s relic?

476
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,500
Long Aoyi.

477
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,060
I take you

478
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,300
as my closest person besides my mother.

479
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,300
But you are so cruel to me.

480
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,340
You are such a heartless
and malicious woman.

481
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,370
You misunderstand me.

482
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,580
Let me go! What are you doing?

483
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,210
Is this your child with Li Qingliu?

484
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,500
My master was killed
by someone in the Palace.

485
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,100
Only in this way

486
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,130
can I enter the Palace.

487
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,820
Aoyi.

488
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Promise me,

489
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,210
leave Li Qingliu.

490
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,410
Leave Chang’an.

491
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,340
I will help you find the murderer.

492
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,210
I will avenge you.

493
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,340
All right?

494
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,300
If you insist on staying with Li Qingliu,

495
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,300
I’ll tell Father
about your fake pregnancy!

496
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,740
From now on,

497
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,410
you are no longer
my brother of Longzhu Gang.

498
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,370
Aoyi!

499
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,940
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

500
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
There is still no clue
about the fancy carp pattern.

501
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,210
And Concubine De just died.

502
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,740
It’s not easy to track down
the person behind her.

503
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,170
You mean they threatened Concubine De

504
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,170
in some ways?

505
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,500
But that person is too strong.

506
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,980
It’s always a step ahead of us.

507
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,580
Every time there is any clue,

508
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,100
it would be wiped out cleanly.

509
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,650
That person can make
Concubine De take the fall,

510
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,690
his power must be above Concubine De.

511
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,760
Counselor Pang has lost his power.

512
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,830
Will it be...

513
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,610
Prime Minister?

514
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,830
Prime Minister has been an official
for decades.

515
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,680
He is upright and fair,

516
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,100
he has never been
accused of any wrongdoings.

517
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,450
If it’s him,

518
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,020
he would be too shrewd and deep.

519
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,980
I don’t believe there is any perfect plan

520
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,390
in this world.

521
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
I’ll ask Yan Bin to investigate it.

522
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,870
We will find some clues.

523
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,030
Let me see.

524
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,680
Did he hurt you today?

525
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,640
It’s just too much for him to take.

526
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,640
He should be fine after a while.

527
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,400
Will he be desperate and tell...

528
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,160
Don’t you know about
Prince Zhao’s childishness?

529
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,120
Besides, he and my master
are cross-age friends.

530
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,640
Verbal decree of His Majesty.

531
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,550
Long uses her fake pregnancy

532
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,920
to collude with people in the Palace

533
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,270
and form a clique to pursue
her own interest.

534
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,030
Court of Judicial Review
will handle this case.

535
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,990
Take her away.

536
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,680
How dare you!

537
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,440
What should come will come.

538
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,440
Wait for me, I’ll be back soon.

539
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,950
Let’s go.

540
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,950
Don’t drink anymore, Your...

541
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,360
You can’t keep drinking.

542
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,550
Why is there no more wine?

543
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,310
Go buy more wine.

544
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,880
Your Highness, I know you feel sad.

545
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,470
You drank too much.

546
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,310
Let’s go back

547
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,680
and have some sleep.

548
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,120
You will feel better the next morning.

549
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,310
Right?

550
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,640
Leave me alone!

551
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:36,600
Your Highness.

552
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,510
My mother died!

553
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,360
I don’t have a home!

554
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,440
I don’t have a home!

555
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,680
What are you looking at?

556
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,790
What are you looking at?

557
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,840
Your Highness!

558
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,160
Your Highness.

559
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,950
I only have my mother.

560
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,200
But I killed her.

561
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,510
God wants to punish me.

562
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,680
Mr. Zhao, be careful.

563
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,940
Mr. Zhao,

564
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,280
let me find a carriage to take you home.

565
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,360
No need.

566
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,360
The lamb tonight

567
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,360
is pretty good.

568
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,590
- It’s him.
- Thanks for your praise.

569
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,710
Mr. Zhao of the Ministry of Penalty.

570
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Go back, go back.

571
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,200
Mr. Zhao.

572
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,920
Go back.

573
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Take care.

574
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,990
What’s wrong?

575
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,710
Your Highness.

576
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,440
Those who hurt my mother...

577
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,030
Your Highness!

578
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,950
Must die!

579
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,790
Your Highness!

580
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,270
Your Highness!

581
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,790
Your Highness, don’t be impulsive!

582
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,550
Your Highness!

583
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,030
Zhao Jin!

584
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,710
Prince Zhao.

585
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,800
Your Highness, calm down.

586
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Your Highness.

587
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,310
Mercy, Your Highness!

588
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,310
Today

589
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,080
I’ll use your life

590
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,200
to honor my mother!

591
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,360
No!

592
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,350
Well, how is the torture instrument?

593
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,230
We are old acquaintances.

594
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,200
No need to entertain me
with such a big house

595
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,680
and so many gifts.

596
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,120
That’s very kind of you.

597
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,310
With your statues now,

598
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,870
of course I need to do some work.

599
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,520
Since we are old acquaintances,
let’s make it easy.

600
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,750
Sign this paper

601
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,400
= Confession =
and plead guilty.

602
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,160
How can I plead guilty
without knowing my crime?

603
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,430
Admit that you approached Prince Jun
through a fake pregnancy

604
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,600
and attempted to make
the royal blood impure.

605
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,120
You interfere in court affairs
with Qinglong Firm.

606
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,310
What is your plan?

607
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,790
Last time I was accused of collusion.

608
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,560
This time you still
accuse me of collusion.

609
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,080
Du Changfeng.

610
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,680
Is all your head filled with water?

611
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,270
Can’t you think of anything else?

612
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,200
You are making me force it out of you.

613
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,430
Squeeze her fingers.

614
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,680
Mr. Du.

615
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,350
She is the Lady of Prince Jun.

616
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,910
If we put her to torture,

617
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,640
what if...

618
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,750
His Majesty ordered me to
interrogate the criminal strictly!

619
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,350
Yes.

620
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,790
If it’s Prince Jun, I won’t see him.

621
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,790
Let him reflect himself in his mansion.

622
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,160
Your Majesty,

623
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,270
Prince Jun asked me to

624
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,000
present this letter to you in person.

625
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,310
He said there are
many doubts about this case.

626
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,790
= From your son, Qingliu =
He begged you to see it.

627
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,310
Okay, I see. You can leave.

628
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,710
Master.

629
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,390
Will it help with you kneeling here?

630
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,960
Lady will be dead

631
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,680
by then!

632
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,520
Master.

633
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,230
