It’s such a happy day today.

34
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,000
Master got some treasures for all of you.

35
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,630
Did you mug a sea-robber?

36
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,000
These are all good stuffs.

37
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,270
In this world,

38
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,360
the biggest robber is the miser.

39
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
The miser hides his wealth in the wolf den.

40
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,070
I stripped the skin of the wolf

41
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,510
and pounded the wolf den
to get these stuffs.

42
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,300
Thank you, Master.

43
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,200
Xiaoqin.

44
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,950
Thank you, Master.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,720
What are you waiting for? Take it.

46
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,800
- Thank you, Master.
- Thank you, Master.

47
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,270
Master.

48
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,870
Take it.

49
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,120
Is that the same person

50
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
who was gulping the rice

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
in the Du’s Mansion?

52
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,190
I’m more convinced that

53
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,190
these people took the gold thread.

54
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,120
Look at them.

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Whose eyes are not glowing

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,870
when they saw the treasure?

57
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,120
Master.

58
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,270
Opium shops, casinos, and Bonan Street
where the Huiqi people gather together

59
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,830
used to be under Qiyan’s protection.

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,680
Now Qiyan is going downhill.

61
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,510
Those who are in charge want us
to take them over. What do you think?

62
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,430
The underworld can’t
go on the stage. Vice versa.

63
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,270
Got it.

64
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,120
One more thing.

65
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,270
I heard from a silkworm farmer that

66
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,160
he saw Dachun show up
at the back door of the Silk Store.

67
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,160
When?

68
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,510
The day before he died.

69
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,190
Master.

70
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,510
They said Dachun stole the gold thread.

71
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,430
Master.

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,510
They said he stole it at the quay.

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
If so,

74
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,160
the reputation of Wanhua

75
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,040
would be all ruined.

76
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,680
The upper class

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
doesn’t want to do business with us.

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,270
They overthrew Longzhu Gang’s
livelihood, right?

79
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,560
Don’t worry.

80
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,270
They said the gold thread
was stolen by Longzhu Gang.

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,270
I must teach them a lesson.

82
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,560
Master, are you sure
it wasn’t Dachun who stole it?

83
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,830
I’m sure you didn’t steal it.

84
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,360
I will find the evidence

85
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,920
to prove the innocence of Longzhu Gang.

86
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,430
Master, the mighty!

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,950
Master, the mighty!

88
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,720
Keep it quiet about Dachun.

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,160
- Got it.
- Got it.

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,680
It’s the gigolo who
made our master go to jail!

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,130
- How dare he come?
- Get him, brothers!

93
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,830
Master.

94
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,190
We have extra dishes today.

95
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,190
Why don’t we make them

96
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,480
into stuffed mutton?

97
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
We haven’t eaten it for a long time.

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,630
Good! That’s great!

99
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,000
Stuffed mutton?

100
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,190
It’s a dish that cleans the innards
of the goose first,

101
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,950
then stuffs it with glutinous rice,

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,870
and puts it into the belly of
the sheep and roasts them together.

103
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,430
Do you want to take
both our money and our lives?

104
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,430
Master, do something about it.

105
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,680
I’m not afraid of death.

106
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,270
I’m afraid that your Sanhualing Kesi

107
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,630
would burn if
it gets near the fire. Master!

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,920
You keep investigating the gold thread.

109
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,920
Now you even follow us to

110
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,560
the place of Longzhu Gang.

111
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,630
Well I think

112
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,310
let’s just cook them!

113
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,750
Wait!

114
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,600
There are also some special requirements
about eating sheep.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,920
The sheep need to have fat and lean meat.

116
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,920
Look at these two.

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
No fat under the skin. Not good enough.

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Let them grow for a while.

119
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,600
Yan Bin.

120
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,040
Post a reward for
the gold thread tomorrow.

121
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Double the bounty. Let’s go.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,560
Wait.

123
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,360
Don’t you follow me here just to know

124
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,080
if I would run away?

125
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,120
Don’t worry, no one hates money.

126
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,720
I see.

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,240
Landlord Li

128
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,630
didn’t eat enough at the banquet.

129
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,270
Come on, bring a seat for Landlord Li.

130
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,320
Bring it up.

131
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,080
Landlord Li.

132
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,980
I’ll walk on my own.

133
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,860
No need.

134
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,320
Really, I don’t need it.

135
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,360
Clothing shows prestige. Gamble has half a
chance. Prostitution ends up in nothing.

136
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,000
Only food never fails you.

137
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,030
Landlord Li, please.

138
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,150
Please.

139
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,390
- Please.
- Please.

140
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,630
Seems that you don’t like the food.

141
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
Fatty, bring the good stuffs.

142
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,510
No problem.

143
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,870
Bamboo chicken. It’s very delicious.

144
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,840
Don’t you use chopsticks?

145
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,670
Come on, bring him a pair of chopsticks.

146
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,480
So troublesome.

147
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,600
Hurry up.

148
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,790
Come on.

149
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,630
Landlord Li, is it delicious?

150
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,000
Seems like it is delicious!

151
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,270
Cheers!

152
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,030
Come on!

153
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,240
Master.

154
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,080
One has Water that leans to Gold.
The other has Fire that leans to Earth.

155
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,030
A destined couple of mandarin ducks.

156
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,120
Mandarin ducks? Aren’t there still some?

157
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,600
Not this mandarin ducks.

158
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,790
But the mandarin ducks here.

159
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,440
I just observed

160
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,080
your physiognomy

161
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,320
and Landlord Li’s.

162
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
You two have distinct personalities
and are not easy to give up.

163
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,480
Although you fight a lot,

164
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,360
you still make a good match.

165
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,480
A good match?

166
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,720
Cheater, be careful about what you say.

167
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,270
To make a good match,

168
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,630
she has to be a woman at least.

169
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,200
Damn! You mean I am not like a woman?

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I also think you are too tender and weak

171
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
to be a man!

172
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,670
Am I wrong?

173
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,480
Where are you looking at?

174
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,840
I’ll kill you!

175
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,080
- Master!
- Let me go!

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,720
I’ll kill you!

177
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,510
Have you seen it?

178
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,480
How dare you talk nonsense!

179
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,360
Master, Master.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,080
Forget it!

181
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,150
Let me go!

182
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,860
= Suyong Hall =

183
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,360
The merchant is not
a high-ranking profession.

184
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,870
I didn’t expect them to
do so well in Silver City.

185
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,150
Your Highness.

186
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,600
Merchants pay more taxes.

187
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,600
They make contributions to
the government and the nation.

188
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,150
Now it’s only a low-ranking
profession in name.

189
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,320
In fact, it has long been reborn.

190
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,870
Especially in Silver City.

191
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,030
Whoever controls the silk industry

192
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,720
Has the right to speak.

193
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,480
No wonder

194
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,120
Li Qingliu

195
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,270
dared to reject publicly
the government investment

196
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
in the banquet.

197
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,120
It’s known for a long time that

198
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,550
Li Qingliu has a temper.

199
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,320
He is not only doing well at business,

200
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
he also mastered

201
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,120
the technique of
the rare Sichuan embroidery.

202
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,360
In Jiannan Dao,

203
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
only he

204
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,960
is granted the Customs Seal
by the Fabric Bureau.

205
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,150
What is that?

206
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,630
It sounds familiar.

207
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,790
Jiannan Dao is located
in the border areas.

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,120
A lot of border trade happens in there.

209
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,910
Silk fabrics like Sichuan embroidery

210
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,630
can only be exported
with the Customs Seal.

211
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,000
Therefore,

212
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,200
Li Qingliu becomes the head

213
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,910
of the silk industry in Silver City.

214
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,790
His Xinsilu even undertakes

215
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,630
almost all the border trade
in Silver City.

216
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,080
Only a merchant can be so arrogant.

217
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,030
Mr. Du.

218
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,510
Can the government investment be

219
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,960
linked to the qualification
of the guild leader?

220
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,150
Your Highness are thinking ahead.

221
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,480
This move is a long-term solution.

222
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,060
Come on!

223
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,730
We must have a drink.

224
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,390
Don’t go!

225
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,850
Come on!

226
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,540
- Bros.
- Let’s drink!

227
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,270
Second Master, I’ll leave the gang to you.

228
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,510
OK.

229
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,960
Master, you have to think it through.

230
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,510
What is the principle of Longzhu Gang?

231
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,630
We don’t steal, rob, poison or abduct.

232
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,270
It’s unification.

233
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,200
Dachun died.

234
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,150
We can’t explain it.

235
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,670
If he stole the gold thread,

236
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,720
I have to take the responsibility.

237
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,510
Besides,

238
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,960
I think there is a mole in the Silk Manor.

239
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,080
A mole?

240
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,060
= Xinsilu =

241
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,150
What’s that?

242
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,240
What are you doing?

243
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,200
You want to get in the Silk Manor?

244
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,750
To investigate the gold thread,

245
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,440
we have to act at any time

246
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
and share the information.

247
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,240
I took off your post.

248
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,030
Naturally, I need to
live in the Silk Manor.

249
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,960
It’s convenient for me to investigate.

250
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,000
Master Long.

251
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,960
The Silk Manor is not somewhere

252
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,480
you can get in as you want.

253
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,960
We don’t raise idlers.

254
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Tell me what you can do.

255
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,200
I can do everything.

256
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,440
Silk reeling?

257
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,320
Dyeing?

258
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,630
Not to mention

259
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,630
tailoring?

260
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
I can do that.

261
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,790
Isn’t it just sewing stuff?

262
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,390
I’ll make sure to patch every hole!

263
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,480
You really know nothing.

264
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
I can do it.

265
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,840
Or I can learn from scratch.

266
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,720
Okay, Yan Bin.

267
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,480
Serve the good stuff.

268
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,790
Since you want to learn from scratch,

269
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,790
let’s start with sweeping the floor.

270
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,440
This account is made delicately.

271
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,510
I don’t see a chink there.

272
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,310
This is the white fungus soup
specially prepared for you.

273
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,880
Thank you, Miss Du.

274
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,790
Taxes and tributes.

275
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,830
Storage and accounts.

276
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,270
Your Highness, you only checked
half of the accounts.

277
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,480
Why do you come out in advance?

278
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,310
Think about it.

279
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,510
There is such a big tax loophole

280
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,160
in Jiannan Dao.

281
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,030
But the account of Salt and Iron Bureau

282
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,510
is made seamless.

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,640
Clearly,

284
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
the commissioner and all the officials of

285
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,160
Salt and Iron Bureau
have prepared themselves

286
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,830
for me, the Salt and Iron Officer.

287
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,070
Now,

288
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,480
what we can see

289
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,310
is what they want us to see.

290
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,160
How dare these

291
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,270
lowly officials

292
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,680
fool our dignified prince!

293
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,480
But your dignified prince

294
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,480
won’t

295
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,400
let them get away easily.

296
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,400
Look at this.

297
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,350
This is the list of
major merchants in Silver City.

298
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,510
We got it from the banquet yesterday.

299
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
Let’s go to meet them.

300
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,480
OK.

301
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,590
Level and vertical, stick to the rules.

302
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,830
Level and vertical, stick to the rules.

303
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,720
- Level and vertical, stick to the rules.
- Make a way.

304
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,340
Level and vertical, stick to the rules.

305
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,590
What level and vertical?

306
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,640
Level and vertical, stick to the rules.

307
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,040
Aloof temperament.

308
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,080
She must get up before dawn
to wear makeup.

309
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,560
Linen-cotton blended.

310
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,630
Low-end.

311
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,030
Skin condition is just so-so.

312
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,270
Puffy eyes. Not good.

313
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,350
Crack me down?

314
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
There are tons of
beautiful girls in the brothel.

315
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,590
With a wild feature.

316
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,030
Qingliu won’t…

317
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,830
Xiaoxian.

318
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,000
Go to check the

319
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,480
buying list for the next season.

320
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,000
Xiaoxian?

321
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,350
Okay.

322
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,240
You all have met Master Long, right?

323
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,920
Yes. We have known each other well.

324
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,070
I don’t need to say more

325
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,510
about the missing gold thread.

326
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,960
You all know it.

327
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,310
Longzhu Gang can’t get away with it.

328
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,480
Master Long came to Xinsilu this time

329
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,400
to put pressure on Longzhu Gang.

330
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,400
As long as the gold thread
is still missing,

331
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,310
Master Long can’t clear her suspicion.

332
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,790
Get away with what?

333
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,510
It was you…

334
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
I’ll bear it for
the 10,000 taels of silver.

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,550
Li Jun’er.

336
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,310
You were late twice this month

337
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,240
and left early once.

338
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,750
Do you remember our rules?

339
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,750
Late for once,
deduct three strings of coins.

340
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,680
Late for twice, deduct half of the salary.

341
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,030
Self-made nail paint. Very economical.

342
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,270
The mark on the neck
is obviously a hickey.

343
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,350
With that look...

344
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,350
Is her lover among these male employees?

345
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,550
Now that you know it,

346
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
I’ll deduct your wages of this month.

347
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,590
Qi Honghua.

348
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,720
After the meeting,
dress Master Long in a work clothes.

349
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,070
Yes.

350
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,580
= Qinyuan Restaurant =

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,550
Your Highness.

352
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,750
The Osmanthus Wine in this restaurant

353
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,920
is more mellow than that of Chang’an.

354
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,750
How about we bring a few jars
back before we leave?

355
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,240
A few jars are not enough.

356
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,070
Why don’t you stay here to learn

357
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,880
their technique before you return?

358
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,880
We are here to do tax inspection.

359
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,070
It would be improper.

360
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
You are sober now.

361
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,880
There are still several restaurants ahead.

362
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,240
Let’s hurry up.

363
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,590
The one of the best restaurants
in Silver City

364
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,160
pays less taxes

365
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,680
than a small wine shop of the lower class.

366
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,200
Forget it, that’s call it a day.

367
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,920
But we haven’t found any clues.

368
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Someone must leak
the information to these profiteers

369
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,960
and tell them to put away their fox tail.

370
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,830
We will give this matter
some further thought after we go back.

371
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,960
Your Highness.

372
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,680
I want to go to the latrine.

373
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,830
Go ahead.

374
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,160
= Guji Pawnshop =

375
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,750
Your Highness.

376
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,030
Guess who I just met in the latrine?

377
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,750
Going to the latrine makes you that happy?

378
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,750
Who did you meet?

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,440
People in Du’s Mansion.

380
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,110
Are you sure

381
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,640
it’s the person who
showed up at the banquet

382
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,200
in Du’s Mansion that day?

383
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,680
Those two people look sneaky.

384
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
Sounds like they are
going to some restaurant.

385
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,720
Okay.

386
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,790
Let’s follow them.

387
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,160
You really changed.

388
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,400
Why did you let her live with the nanny?

389
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,510
What’s wrong with that?

390
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,030
Our Silk Manor never takes in outsiders.

391
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,110
Even our closest merchant

392
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,640
would only stay in a good hotel.

393
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,000
But you let Long Aoyi stay here.

394
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,480
Most of the employees here
came from the lower class.

395
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,240
They are related to

396
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,440
Long Aoyi in different kinds of ways.

397
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,070
I let her live with nanny

398
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,960
because I want this troublemaker

399
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,550
to take it down a notch.

400
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,400
No matter how unruly she is,

401
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,790
she would respect the elderly.

402
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,790
Aren’t you the one

403
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,030
who changed clothes for me?

404
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,310
Master Long, please change into
the work clothes.

405
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,720
I’m not here to work.

406
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,960
Why should I wear work clothes?

407
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,920
No, we have rules here that

408
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,400
women cannot wear hairpins,

409
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,200
rouge and powder, or floral skirt.

410
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,790
Don’t make it difficult for me.

411
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,270
What damn rule is it?

412
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,160
Dress people like buried pottery figurines

413
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,510
and make them look the same way.
Is that good looking?

414
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,310
Well…

415
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Why are my clothes
not pretty as Du Xiaoxian’s?

416
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,110
The workers here all wear like this.

417
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,640
Miss Du is the Second Master.

418
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,680
Her clothes are different from ours.

419
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,160
Never mind.

420
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,510
What should I call you?

421
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,750
Qi?

422
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,960
My last name is Qi.
My lowly first name is Honghua.

423
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,200
They all call me fatty girl here.

424
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,400
Fatty girl?

425
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,200
You are not fat.

426
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,550
Why do they call you fatty girl?

427
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,350
Besides, your name is not lowly.

428
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,720
Don’t belittle yourself.

429
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,310
I’ll call you chubby girl.

430
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,200
Chubby girl.

431
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,270
Change me into

432
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,070
some neat clothes.

433
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
All right?

434
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,070
Good girl.

435
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,480
Go ahead.

436
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,160
= Shoufeng Building =

437
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,960
It should be here.

438
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,350
Right here?

439
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,030
What kind of restaurant
will be at such a remote place?

440
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,880
Did I hear it wrong?

441
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,290
Take a look!

442
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,270
Do you smell anything?

443
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,270
It’s the smell of roasted pheasant.

444
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,920
How can the ordinary people
afford such a good dish?

445
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,400
If there is a restaurant,

446
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,480
why do I not see a signboard here?

447
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,790
How do they run the restaurant?

448
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,840
Okay. Thanks.

449
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,640
Take care.

450
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:05,850
A few days later…

451
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,510
Your Highness.

452
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,070
I might have seen that short guy.

453
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,740
Good day.

454
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
It seems that we come to the right place.

455
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,000
Is this the wild-game restaurant

456
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,510
that Mr. Feng recommended?

457
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,310
Yes, it is.

458
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,680
What can I do for you?

459
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,800
We are from Luoyang,

460
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,520
coming to Silver City to do silk business.

461
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,800
We heard that

462
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,070
there is a very delicious

463
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,040
wild-game restaurant nearby.

464
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,800
We came here to have a taste.

465
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,150
There are

466
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,350
some home-cooked dishes
specially prepared for the friends.

467
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,350
There are also Sichuan specialties.

468
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,760
You two came from afar,

469
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,150
if you don’t mind,

470
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,920
please come inside and have some rest.

471
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,590
Have some rest?

472
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,150
Okay.

473
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,230
Let’s go.

474
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,830
Please, sir.

475
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,390
Please come inside, sir.

476
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,660
Try this.

477
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,870
This is good.

478
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,750
What dishes do you have today?

479
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,750
We have

480
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,350
carmine goose breast, stuffed mutton,

481
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,880
honey pickled prunus mume,
and roasted roe deer.

482
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,960
I smelled roasted pheasant

483
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,000
at the door.

484
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,920
Are those people at that table

485
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,070
having rice bird?

486
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, are you afraid
that I can’t afford it?

487
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,240
Do you know who our master is?

488
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,400
Don’t be angry, sir.

489
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,550
We’ll prepare the dishes now.

490
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,790
Waiter, another jar of grape wine!

491
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,590
Here it comes!

492
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,880
I mean, believe it or not…

493
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Sir.

494
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,000
Who are they at that table?

495
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,110
I never saw them before.

496
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,550
Silk merchants from Luoyang.

497
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,880
Pretty generous.

498
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,720
Your Highness, it sounds lively upstairs.
It should be a casino.

499
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,270
The situation inside is not clear yet.

500
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,310
People here are wary of strangers.

501
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,270
I didn’t dare to ask more.

502
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,750
I even saw people eating mice here.

503
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,000
Those rich people
can eat whatever they want,

504
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,920
but they have to eat mice

505
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,480
What do you think?

506
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,880
I want to try it, too.

507
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,960
In your dream!

508
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,510
I’m asking what the situation is here.

509
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,310
Here gathers the officials and merchants
of the upper class in Silver City.

510
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,400
I think it will help us gather information.

511
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,160
That’s what I thought.

512
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,240
But us two strangers being here

513
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,030
is easy to arouse suspicion.

514
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,790
It would be easier in the casino.

515
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,070
At the gaming table,

516
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,510
no one would care about who you are.

517
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,510
Handling a case in the casino,

518
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,030
why does it sound so familiar?

519
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,680
Long...

520
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,030
Waiter!

521
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,640
Coming!

522
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,590
Sir.

523
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,200
It seems to be a big place here.

524
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,240
Is there anything new

525
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,590
that you can show us?

526
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,240
Yes, there is.

527
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,960
But we haven’t served the dishes yet.

528
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,310
No hurry.

529
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,480
We can eat when the dishes are ready.

530
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,240
Please come with me, sir.

531
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,960
Watch carefully.

532
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,200
Why are you being so sneaky?

533
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,380
Before you lost the gold thread,

534
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
did anyone else know about it

535
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,760
in the Silk Manor?

536
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,040
Just me, Xiaoxian and Yan Bin.

537
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,520
The three of us

538
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,550
know when and where
the gold thread would arrive.

539
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,550
And the shipping space of it.

540
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,800
Other people

541
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,480
only know part of the information.

542
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,160
What do you want to say?

543
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,550
Those who know all the information
can be excluded.

544
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,790
Who are the other people?

545
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,640
The four supervisors,

546
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,310
except for Treasurer Dongzi
knows nothing about it,

547
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,680
the rest three know some of it.

548
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,360
Shuisheng and Qi Zheng know
the time and location.

549
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,400
Li Jun’er is in charge of the key
to the box of the gold thread.

550
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,990
Why are you asking it?

551
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,160
Well, I have my own reason.

552
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
Let’s go to where they work.

553
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,790
Maybe we can find some clues there.

554
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,400
Let’s go to Li Jun’er first.

555
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,030
Better not let me down.

556
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,210
Follow me.

557
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,070
Better not let me down.

558
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
What’s that look?

559
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,070
Feels like you are watching out for me.

560
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,510
Guards should be vigilant.

561
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,070
Why does he act like
he is doing something bad?

562
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,590
Jun’er, follow me to the warehouse.

563
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,750
Yes.

564
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,400
Is there only this little inventory
in your warehouse?

565
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,880
You don’t know it.

566
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,350
Our stocking and selling

567
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,960
are doing really well.

568
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,550
The products and raw materials

569
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,830
won’t pile up.

570
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,960
The shelf is dusty.

571
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,070
Is that doing well?

572
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,630
This is prepared for gold thread

573
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,040
and gold thread clothes.

574
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,280
Jun’er, your job is pretty good.

575
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,440
No sun and wind exposure.

576
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,630
The salary is good.

577
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,350
Look at your tender hands.

578
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,480
You are making fun of me.

579
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,550
Although I am the supervisor,

580
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,350
my job is not easier than the weavers.

581
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,760
Our Silk Manor

582
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,550
never raises idlers.

583
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,590
It’s Li Jun’er’s footprint.

584
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,510
Seems that my judgment is correct.

585
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,790
Mr. Bai, you lost again.

586
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,270
Such a bad luck.

587
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,240
Master, I might have seen

588
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,400
that person over there at Wanhua Casino.

589
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,550
Mr. Bai.

590
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,790
Officer from the Salt and Iron Bureau.

591
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,510
Sorry, Mr. Bai.

592
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,110
One more time!

593
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,960
Mr. Bai, let’s call it a day.

594
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,110
I’ll write you an IOU in the next game.

595
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,350
Let’s continue!

596
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,200
You have been gambling here
for half a month.

597
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,550
You almost lost everything.

598
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,000
I advise you to go back first

599
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
and take a shower

600
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,720
to get rid of your bad luck.

601
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,960
It seems that this little officer

602
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,110
has a serious gambling addiction.

603
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,070
Gambling at here

604
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,350
requires at least 1,000 taels per table.

605
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,400
He is just a little officer,

606
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,750
and he can gamble at here.

607
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,510
Let me meet him.

608
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:27,750
Master.

609
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,030
We never gambled before.

610
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,960
Can you really do it?

611
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,680
Miss Long can do it. Why can’t I?

612
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,030
Go back.

613
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,030
When I was playing outside,

614
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,720
you were running around
in your open-crotch pants!

615
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,880
Watch your attitude.

616
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,530
Can’t afford to lose.

617
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,440
Mr. Bai, we are here for fun.

618
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,440
Don’t get angry.

619
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,030
If you still want to play,

620
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,200
our master is willing to play with you.

621
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,960
I’ve long heard of your name.

622
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,960
My surname is Zhang.

623
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,270
I come to Silver City
from Luoyang to do silk business.

624
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,640
No matter where you come from,

625
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,830
I’ll gamble with you for once.

626
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,550
Come on.

627
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,240
Mr. Bai.

628
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,750
You know

629
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,270
it’s not easy for me to come from afar.

630
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,960
It’s boring to bet on a small stake.

631
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,440
Why don’t we play something exciting?

632
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,270
You can talk big.

633
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,480
How do you want to play?

634
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,270
= 50,000 Taels =

635
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,440
Mr. Bai, have a look.

636
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,110
This is 50,000 taels.

637
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,830
My shopkeeper

638
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,880
gave it to me for buying goods

639
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,830
in Silver City.

640
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,240
You can take it all
if you are good enough.

641
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,270
Master.

642
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,680
It’s your first time to gamble.

643
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,480
How about we bet half of it first?

644
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,680
Well, then…

645
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,480
The deed in the North City. Come on!

646
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,880
Here.

647
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,620
= Deed =

648
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,980
= Xu =

649
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,140
= Wei =

650
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,230
You lost.

651
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,960
One more time?

652
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,840
No problem.

653
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,280
Wu Lin.

654
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,510
Go to the Bai family

655
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,710
and take my property.

656
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,670
Got it.

657
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,510
Mr. Zhang, please don’t!

658
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,320
My family is living there.

659
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,800
Are you going to deny it?

660
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,840
That is not what I mean.

661
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,550
I did lose.

662
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,280
I just want to ask for a few days.

663
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,000
Three days, 50,000 taels.

664
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,070
Not a penny less.

665
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,280
Well, I’ll leave for Luoyang

666
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,590
the day after tomorrow morning.

667
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,630
Give me the bank note

668
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,960
tomorrow night at the latest.

669
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,760
Or...

670
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,440
I will visit you in person at your mansion.

671
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,480
Do you have the key to the warehouse?

672
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,110
It’s an empty warehouse.
What do you want to do?

673
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
I’ll meet you

674
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
at the gate of the warehouse at midnight.

675
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,960
Remember to bring the key.

676
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,400
I have a surprise for you.

677
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,880
Xiaoqin.

678
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,000
Master, here.

679
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,920
Be careful. It’s hot.

680
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,150
Master, you have suffered these days.

681
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,030
How about

682
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,070
I get our men
to encircle the Silk Manor

683
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,280
and starve them for three days?

684
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
See if they dare

685
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,030
to keep feeding you vegetarian food.

686
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,960
The food here is actually good.

687
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,800
It’s just unpalatable.

688
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,670
I always feel

689
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,510
it’s lack of the smell of the firewood.

690
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,360
By the way, Master.

691
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,320
How is your investigation going?

692
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,400
There are doubt points.

693
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,320
But I can’t connect them.

694
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,550
It’s just some ungrounded suspicion.

695
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,800
Do you want to eat?

696
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,510
No. I ate before.

697
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,710
You eat more.

698
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,280
It’s so delicious.

699
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,230
It’s getting late.

700
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,230
Go back now.
Be careful not to be seen by them.

701
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,880
Her face is getting thinner.

702
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,840
I need to bring her more
pork hock and bacon

703
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,590
next time.

704
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,710
The more, the better.

705
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,800
Miss Xiaoqin.

706
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,550
What are you doing here so late?

707
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,840
Hey, I haven’t finished.

708
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,230
It hurts!

709
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,320
You did it first.

710
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,840
I mean, why do you a little girl

711
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,110
have such a big temper?

712
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,480
You should change yourself!

713
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,590
You would scare away

714
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,360
all the boys in this world!

715
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,510
Even you don’t scare them away,
you would beat them away

716
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,880
and be left all alone.

717
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,710
You won’t get married being like this!

718
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,840
None of your business!

719
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,320
Crazy girl.

= Xinsilu =

721
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,840
Ma’am.

722
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,030
I thought Li Qingliu

723
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,880
would lock me in a thatched hut.

724
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,480
I didn’t expect him
to let me live with you.

725
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,360
This place

726
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,510
is like my house.

727
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,880
He sounds mean.

728
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,960
But he is soft-hearted.

729
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,320
You’ll know it.

730
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,630
I have learned his meanness.

731
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,030
As for his soft heart,

732
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,670
I think he has the heart to take
advantages, but he is too soft to do it.

733
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,760
By the way, Ma’am.

734
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,670
Why are his parents not here?

735
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,230
It’s a long story.

736
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,030
There is no need to mention it.

737
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,150
Does he start his business

738
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,590
from scratch?

739
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,400
He is so competent.

740
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,190
I’ve never seen such a clever girl.

741
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,590
Our Qingliu won’t choose the wrong person.

742
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,670
Girl.

743
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,400
What do you do in the Silk Manor?

744
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,510
Girl?

745
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,710
Girl?

746
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,920
At the midnight, it’s safe and sound.

It’s really scary at night!

750
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,960
We should meet at midnight.
You are one hour late.

751
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,360
Did you oversleep again?

752
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,510
Who overslept?

753
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,400
I didn’t even close my eyes.

754
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,000
Wipe your saliva first.

755

Those who achieve big things
don’t stick to “rifles”.

You asked me out

in the middle of the night,

758

what do you want to do?
