Guys,

33
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,650
today is the day Xinsilu and Longzhu Gang

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,220
open up Qinglong Firm together.

35
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,980
I hereby make a toast to Master Long.

36
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,090
Let’s forget about those small talks.

37
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,700
I’m not such a righteous person at all.

38
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,770
I’m just doing it

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,770
because it’s profitable.

40
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,290
Today is the day

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,410
we form a big family.

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,650
Let’s drink to the big family!

43
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,180
Yes.

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,860
Cheers!

45
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,780
Yes. Cheers!

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,420
Cheers!

47
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,180
Come on.

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,970
- Come on.
- Cheers!

49
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,500
To family.

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:01,970
Cheers.

51
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,330
Family?

52
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,930
Aren’t I a member of this family?

53
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,820
This is Nyuerhong liquor
from second master.

54
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,690
Please enjoy yourselves.

55
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,330
Come on.

56
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,180
The first drink is to show my respect.

57
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,970
Let’s drink for our hard work.

58
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,460
In the heavy rain in May,

59
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,380
I waited to pay the workers
delivering the first garments.

60
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,660
This second drink

61
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,740
is to myself.

62
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,770
Like a cast-iron man,

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,660
I accompanied this hard-hearted man

64
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,900
to start from scratch.

65
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,370
OK.

66
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,210
Let’s drink together.

67
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,330
Lady.

68
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,610
Run after her!

69
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,140
You hurry up!

70
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,610
You piss your partner off.

71
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
Hurry up!

72
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
How can I expect to cooperate with

73
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,460
such an indifferent man?

74
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,810
Xiaoxian.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,740
Pancakes.

76
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,370
Xiaoxian.

77
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,700
Freshly made pancakes.

78
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,610
Xiaoxian.

79
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,330
Never discussed such a big deal with me!

80
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,140
Do you still regard me
as the second master?

81
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,020
Nyuertu deceives me too much.

82
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
We are forced to establish Qinglong.

83
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,260
Now there is a Nyuertu,

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,900
tomorrow there might be a Nanertu.

85
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,530
You are always cautious.

86
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,580
Why are you so headlong this time?

87
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,700
I think, maybe it is
because you love Long Aoyi.

88
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,770
I just want to find the painter
with her help.

89
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,210
In addition,

90
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,740
I have become a thorn for commissioner,

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,330
leading to tension between you and him,

92
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,300
and I am afraid you will suffer from it.

93
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,180
Suffer from it?

94
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,260
For so many years,

95
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,810
I help you to develop the industry,

96
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,140
while you treat me as an outsider.

97
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,260
Two years ago,

98
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,330
there was a forest here.

99
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,410
We were planning our future

100
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,820
under a gardenia tree.

101
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,140
This purse

102
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,090
is full of fallen flowers
of the that tree.

103
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,090
I used to take it out and look at it,

104
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,380
and look forward to the future.

105
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,170
I hope when you see that,

106
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,290
you will never forget when we started.

107
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,380
But now,

108
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,940
you’ve been having an affair

109
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,140
with a lowlife girl

110
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,210
and you’re kicking me out.

111
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,500
Xiaoxian.

112
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,580
We have always talked calmly.

113
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,940
But why every time I mention Long Aoyi,

114
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,580
you would never let it go?

115
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,170
Because you don’t believe my decision?

116
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,330
Or there has been no privity

117
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,410
between us?

118
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,090
I always treat you like my own sister.

119
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,060
The most urgent task now is
to make the Nyuertu.

120
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,940
Mr. Supervisor,

121
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,380
this is the fine product I selected.

122
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,410
How is it?

123
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,060
This is totally unqualified.

124
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,210
Please tell us the reason.

125
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,210
These lines are totally inconsistent with

126
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,530
the requirements of a national gift.

127
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,060
It not only affects the folk customs
of our Tang Dynasty,

128
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,970
but also extremely corrupted

129
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,290
the customs of our country.

130
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,600
The court has strict requirements

131
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,120
on Nyuertu.

132
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,870
It is required to be

133
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,800
neither immoral nor rigid.

134
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,020
As mentioned

135
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,630
in the Han History,

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,430
a couple have a sex in the studio,

137
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,240
set up a banquet for parents and sisters.

138
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,870
Make people look up to draw pictures.

139
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,720
You mean,

140
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,800
find a demonstration.

141
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,750
This damn supervisor is too strict,

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,310
so we have to think about it

143
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,680
from this perspective.

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,240
Shadow play is the same as what you said.

145
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,800
Exactly.

146
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,190
Shadow play is made of sheepskin,

147
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,120
and we’ll change it into a real person.

148
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,000
But...

149
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,070
Let a girl and a man demonstrate...

150
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,720
Isn’t that the Wuyun Pavilion?

151
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,630
Yes, Wuyun Pavilion.

152
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,040
Find some beautiful girls to demonstrate.

153
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,110
See?

154
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,090
Why you give up?

155
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,410
How can I continue?

156
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,580
Look at them.

157
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,820
No one is willing to have a try.

158
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,410
Let me tell you,

159
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,460
anyone chosen by Master Xu

160
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,700
is not allowed to refuse.

161
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,730
No way.

162
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,090
I have to arrange the production.

163
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,140
How can you produce
before he finishes the design draft.

164
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,140
What about my posture, is it OK?

165
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,810
Just relax.

166
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,170
Although it is a shadow,

167
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,050
you still need to pay attention
to your posture

168
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,650
- and take it easy.
- Yes.

169
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,770
Yes, that’s right.

170
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,690
You should straighten your waist.

171
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,740
How about this?

172
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,500
Wait.

173
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,530
You can’t be too seductive, either.

174
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,900
You should be reserved.

175
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,930
Try to welcome while saying no.

176
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,810
What’s that on earth?

177
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,140
What a grievance you have!

178
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,900
You’ll just stand there like wood,

179
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,140
with glazed face

180
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,930
and stiff limbs.

181
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,340
So, you want to kill someone?

182
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,980
You are such a badass.

183
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I have done whatever you want me to do.

184
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,930
Why aren’t you satisfied?

185
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,170
If a couple like each other,

186
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,530
how can they be like this?

187
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,650
What is love?

188
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,450
Have you never liked anyone?

189
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,380
Imagine that, the one you like stands
in front of you

190
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,220
and looks at you with love,

191
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,100
just like when you see Du Xiaoxian.

192
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,290
What?

193
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,900
Du Xiaoxian?

194
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,740
Is your master really stupid
or playing dumb?

195
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,220
I can’t believe why he doesn’t understand.

196
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,770
What’s up?

197
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,740
He went out to chase Du Xiaoxian that day.

198
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,980
Then another day he asked my lady out

199
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,530
in the teahouse.

200
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,650
He fell in love with two girls
at the same time.

201
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,290
He is quite bad to do so.

202
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,220
What an insult the dog has done
to the tiger!

203
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,570
Who is that dog?

204
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Do you dare say that again?

205
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,740
OK.

206
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,050
Yes, that’s right.

207
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,620
Keep that gesture.

208
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,450
Both you guys keep it.

209
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,860
I’m going to draw the picture.

210
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,810
She gently refused me,

211
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,650
and her elegant talk is
just like fragrance of bluegrass.

212
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,530
We confided our love to each other,

213
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,260
and our hearts were filled
with passion and joy.

Are you all right?

239
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,100
What are you doing here?

240
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,450
I’m really worried about you,

241
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,050
so I followed you all the time.

242
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,530
Nothing.

243
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,620
Back then,

244
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,100
you ran out from Longzhu Gang.

245
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
I looked at you and Master Li
from a distance,

246
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,900
and I didn’t know what you said.

247
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,570
Yue’er.

248
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,900
I don’t want to mention him tonight.

249
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,530
And I don’t want to go back.

250
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,740
Please accompany me for a walk outside.

251
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,810
Lady.

252
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,570
You’d better keep this purse.

253
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,410
Who allowed you

254
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,380
to pick it up?

255
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,500
It has been with you for so many years,

256
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,450
and you regard it like the treasure
and wear it.

257
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,810
I just can’t bear...

258
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,620
What’s inside

259
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,380
is just some fallen petals.

260
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,770
I was so stupid

261
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,220
to regard them as treasures.

262
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,260
How about this?

263
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,620
I’ll keep it for you

264
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,860
for the time being.

265
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,140
You can take it back
when you think it over.

266
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,450
Up to you.

267
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,220
= Wine =

268
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,170
On the seventh day of the seventh moon
when none was near,

269
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,930
at midnight in Long Life Hall,
he whispered in her ear,

270
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,450
on high, we’d be two lovebirds
flying wing to wing;

271
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,570
on earth, two trees with branches twined
from spring to spring.

272
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,770
The boundless sky and endless earth
may pass away,

273
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,770
but this vow unfulfilled
will be regretted for aye.

274
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,050
Perhaps it was because

275
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,410
they don’t need to wait
for each other like humans

276
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,620
that they could live happily
until they died

277
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,980
even though they were separated
by the Milky Way.

278
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,620
That’s why these love songs

279
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,620
can last for thousands of years.

280
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,170
Altair appears to the west
of the Milky Way, Vega to the east.

281
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,050
They look at each other forever,
but who has ever seen them together?

282
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,050
This love poem handed down
through the ages

283
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,690
turns out to be a lie.

284
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,340
Maybe I’m the only fool.

285
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,450
Don’t say that, lady.

286
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,980
Mr. Li just lost his head for a moment,

287
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,570
and he’ll be sorry later.

288
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,740
Don’t comfort me.

289
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,140
Even though he loved me before,

290
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,220
now things are different,

291
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,620
no matter what I do

292
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,050
we cannot go back to the past.

293
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,020
Yue’er.

294
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,690
Wu Lin.

295
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,900
What is he doing here at that deep night?

296
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,530
Is Prince Zhao also there?

297
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,690
Your Highness!

298
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,770
I bought the last pork leg

299
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,530
from Zhouzi Zhang!

300
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,050
Thanks to my agility,

301
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,650
or you can’t enjoy it.

302
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,500
Come on,

303
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,690
every day, in the Du’s Mansion,

304
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,810
I have to eat a diet without meat,

305
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,020
which makes me malnourished.

306
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,770
I’ve been craving a leg
of pork these days.

307
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,900
Here, eat some!

308
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,290
But, Your Highness.

309
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,410
Just now, at the door,

310
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,140
I saw Miss Du and Yue’er outside.

311
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,900
Why are they here?

312
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,140
At this late hour,

313
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,100
are they hungry, too?

314
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,650
I don’t know.

315
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,930
But, you see, it’s very late now,

316
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,380
and the girls aren’t safe

317
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,220
out there.

318
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,860
I know what you’re thinking about.

319
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,810
Go ahead and invite Miss Du

320
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,140
if she wants to have a drink.

321
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,570
OK.

322
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,620
Miss Du, come on.

323
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
Miss Du, come on.

324
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,290
I am so sorry to disturb you,
Your Highness.

325
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,620
You needn’t be so stiff

326
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,100
since you’d like to have a drink with me.

327
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,380
We may as well

328
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,650
forget our ordinary status,

329
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,540
I am not the prince,

330
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,450
and you are not the rich girl.

331
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,250
We are just two passersby
who meet by chance

332
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,060
and drown their sorrows in wine.

333
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,300
Miss Du, you got something on your mind?

334
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,340
Your Highness are also full of worries.

335
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:01,930
Well.

336
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,930
Then we two similar miserable guys
get together

337
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,650
to enjoy the drink.

338
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,490
Leave our trouble until tomorrow!

339
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,780
Whatever you say.

340
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,380
You see, Miss Du

341
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,900
and His Highness sit together,

342
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,860
and they are really

343
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,010
a perfect match.

344
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,410
But who would have thought

345
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,540
they both liked someone of their own?

346
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,010
Both lonely people in the deep night.

347
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,620
So heartrending.

348
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,340
Do you think the God of Love

349
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,930
accidentally hooked up the wrong couples?

350
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
I have never seen someone

351
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,540
so dedicated to love in my life,

352
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,140
and here are two.

353
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,860
One is your Miss Du,

354
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,450
and the other is Prince Zhao.

355
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Of course.

356
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,140
My lady once told me that,

357
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,250
when she was six years old,

358
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,900
once she first met Master Li

359
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,780
she had a different feeling for him.

360
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,010
Six years old.

361
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,100
That’s just a kid.

362
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,580
They fell in love at such a young age.

363
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,580
Exactly.

364
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,970
But it was not the two of them,

365
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,410
only my lady.

366
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,100
Back then,

367
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,170
my mother took me to a silk store
in the Northern City

368
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,380
to buy new clothes

369
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,780
as a gift for me being a teenager.

370
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,380
That’s when

371
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,860
I first met Qingliu.

372
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,300
Goat.

373
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,250
Water.

374
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,410
Ghost.

375
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,380
Wood.

376
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,410
Gold.

377
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,540
Fire.

378
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,580
Han.

379
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
Therefore,

380
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,490
Master Li was adopted
by a young couple in a silk shop

381
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,780
from an early age.

382
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,780
In fact,

383
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,860
he was taken to Silver City
by his nanny

384
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,780
when he was a little child.

385
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,250
By chance,

386
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,930
he met Mr. and Mrs. Li,
who had no children.

387
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,820
Because he looks lovely,

388
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,620
he was accepted as an adopted son.

389
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,170
After his adoptive parents died,

390
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,170
the nanny raised him.

391
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,620
Later,

392
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,340
the nanny raised Yan Bin
to accompany Qingliu.

393
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,490
We three are partners
who grew up together.

394
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,650
Qingliu is eccentric,

395
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,900
and doesn’t want to make friends
with others.

396
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,300
So apart from Yan Bin and me,

397
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,010
he has few friends around him.

398
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,900
I am very envious

399
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,380
of the childhood relationship

400
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,540
between Master Li and you.

401
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,170
It would be great

402
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,730
if there were such an opportunity

403
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,540
between Miss Long and me.

404
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,100
Can she

405
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,540
feel your love?

406
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,690
Faith can move mountains.

407
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,210
I believe that I will move her one day.

408
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,490
I also believe that

409
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,620
Master Li and you

410
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,100
will stay together forever.

411
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,250
It’s no use having only
the two of us believe that.

412
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
From now on,

413
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,140
we should also help each other.

414
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:00,780
OK.

415
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,100
Come on, drink more.

416
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,100
You haven’t spoken up all this way.

417
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,620
If you have anything to say,
just speak up.

418
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,340
I heard that

419
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,410
Miss Du and Prince Zhao

420
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,490
drank together all night yesterday.

421
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,900
Finally,

422
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,140
taking Miss Du by the hand,

423
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,540
Prince Zhao sent her back to Du’s Mansion.

424
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,010
That’s what I heard from someone else.

425
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,140
I thought you really have something
important to say.

426
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,380
How can such a trifle make you hold it
all the way!

427
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,900
Aren’t you worried?

428
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,930
Worry for what?

429
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,730
You said, what if Prince Zhao

430
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,930
is really a heartbreaker?

431
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,820
What should we do?

432
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,060
Whose heart was broken by him?

433
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,970
Master,

434
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,010
you are very clever at ordinary times,

435
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,650
but why

436
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,860
are you so insensitive emotionally?

437
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,820
Prince Zhao’s love for Master Long

438
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,140
is well known to everyone,

439
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,730
but now,

440
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,100
he dare interfere with you
when you quarrel with Miss Du.

441
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,250
No matter how careless he is,

442
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,340
he should avoid suspicion.

443
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,210
When you deal with the affairs here,

444
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,730
you always fail to get a good idea,

445
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,300
But when it comes to love,

446
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,250
you have so many words to say.

447
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,730
I...

448
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,620
It seems that you don’t want to
be in charge.

449
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:17,820
Alright.

450
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,970
I’ll send you to the silkworm farm
tomorrow.

451
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,410
No, you wouldn’t.

452
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,340
Don’t worry about these things
from now on.

453
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,100
Leave it to me to do.

454
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,490
Wu Lin,

455
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,970
= Tea =
you go to the tea market tomorrow morning.

456
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,340
Before we go back to Chang’an,

457
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,970
let’s take some tea back to my mother.

458
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,140
OK.

459
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,930
Your Highness.

460
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,450
Your Highness.

461
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,140
Master Li,

462
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,900
you come here to say hello to me,

463
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,450
because you want to talk to me.

464
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,690
You are so smart.

465
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,540
I wonder...

466
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,540
Sit down.

467
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,860
Master Li, please speak out straightly.

468
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,930
I have something important to do.

469
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,820
I wonder whether you like

470
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,730
Xiaoxian

471
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,340
or not.

472
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,820
Wu Lin.

473
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,690
What’s wrong?

474
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,100
What happened last night?

475
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,690
What?

476
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,060
Don’t pretend to be innocent.

477
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,210
I have heard that.

478
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,210
Well...

479
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,380
Although Yue’er is lovely,

480
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,250
I just chatted with her last night

481
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,820
and never did anything wrong.

482
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,930
Are you stupid?

483
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,580
What I want to know is
about Prince Zhao and Miss Du,

484
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,010
not about you and that hot girl.

485
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,650
Tell me!

486
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,970
Don’t talk about His Highness at will.

487
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,010
You go back and stand
and get away from me.

488
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,900
It’s you who let me come here.

489
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,490
Go away.

490
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:05,970
I…

491
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,650
From public,

492
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,450
she is my business partner
to run our silk store.

493
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,450
Personally,

494
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,930
she is a good sister I grew up with.

495
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,250
Therefore,

496
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,690
I hope Your Highness

497
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,450
will get rid of the habit
of being too romantic.

498
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,450
Are you here to warn me?

499
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,300
Well.

500
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,010
Are you concerned about

501
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,380
Miss Du

502
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,210
or Miss Long?

503
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,010
No need to tell you.

504
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,650
Last night,

505
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,650
I did talk with Miss Du for a long time,

506
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,900
and now I know her a little bit.

507
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,380
The deeper I know her,

508
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,930
the less likely I will love her.

509
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,010
On the contrary,

510
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,860
I have known you better,

511
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,010
especially your fickle feelings.

512
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,780
Since you want to talk to me about

513
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,300
romantic love.

514
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,380
Well.

515
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,210
Miss Long is my good friend

516
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,010
and the only person I love.

517
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,300
So I hope you will stay away from her.

518
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,900
Please do not

519
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,620
disturb her often,

520
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,820
lest it doesn’t conform to

521
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,730
your magnanimous status.

522
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,410
As for Miss Du,

523
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,970
before criticizing me,

524
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,620
consider what you owe her

525
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,210
in these years.

526
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,930
Owe her?

527
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,490
What do you mean?

528
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,210
Miss Du accompanies you

529
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,250
throughout her youth.

530
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,970
It doesn’t matter
if you don’t cherish her,

531
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,490
but why did you break her heart?

532
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,900
Don’t you feel guilty?

533
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,450
Xiaoxian and I

534
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,140
are always just brother and sister.

535
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,900
No way.

536
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,730
If you really have no intention,

537
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,340
just tell her directly.

538
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,340
Don’t break her heart,

539
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,480
but pretend to be so affectionate
and righteous.

540
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,130
Right?

541
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,250
That’s all.

542
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,140
I’ve told you what I want to say.

543
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,100
I have to do an important favor
for Miss Long,

544
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,730
I’ll be leaving now.

545
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,130
Excuse me for not keeping you company.

546
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,380
Wrong.

547
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,580
Wrong.

548
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,730
You lost.

549
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,490
Impossible.

550
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,170
Let’s finish now.

551
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,900
I’ve already lost ten times.

552
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,620
Usually, I can always beat you once

553
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,170
every five times, right?

554
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,140
That’s because I give in to you.

555
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,010
How about this time?

556
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,490
I don’t want to.

557
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,970
You should have had a date tonight, right?

558
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,450
Xiaoqin was supposed to
go to dinner with me,

559
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,170
but she went out to dinner
with Master Long

560
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,410
and Prince Zhao.

561
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,580
So I’m alone.

562
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,970
Jealous?

563
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,540
Rumor has it in Chang’an that

564
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,250
you made great efforts in Jiannan Dao

565
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,820
and promised the first tax revenue

566
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,650
in the country before the Emperor.

567
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,060
You officials from the capital

568
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,970
always tease me,

569
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,540
the old poor man in distant place.

570
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,340
Come on,

571
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,900
let’s propose a toast to Mr. Du

572
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,450
with his wine.

573
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,100
The food is so great,

574
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,050
especially this sheep stewed with pepper,

575
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,140
which is actually seasoned with pepper.

576
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,690
Only Mr. Du

577
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,410
can make such

578
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,440
a high-grade meal.

579
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,690
He deserves his title,
the Minister of Six Ministries.

580
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,140
It’s just home cooking. Come on, cheers.

581
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,010
Come on.

582
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,900
I am so curious.

583
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,300
How is the Nyuertu now?

584
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,250
Everybody,

585
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,900
Nyuertu

586
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,900
is supervised by me in the whole process,

587
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,620
and its creativity is
from the Three Menaces,

588
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,100
which can be viewed from far and near,

589
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,920
and is loved by both young and old.

590
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:55,930
Well.

591
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,490
Through it,

592
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,060
let’s wish Mr. Du a pleasant journey

593
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,170
in Chang’an.

594
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,780
In the future,
when you become the head of officials,

595
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
don’t forget us.

596
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,860
I still need your help.

597
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,970
When I arrive in Chang’an,

598
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,540
please remember to

599
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,970
help me expand my connections.

600
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,610
Come on.

601
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,200
- Finish it.
- Sure, sure.

602
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,770
Come on.

603
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Look, everybody.

604
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,100
That... Look...

605
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,820
Mr. Du.

606
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,250
The workmanship of this picture is nice,

607
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,540
but it could be better
if you put more materials.

608
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,140
Mr. Du,

609
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,860
isn’t this picture a bit too explicit?

610
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
It will inevitably affect the dignity
of our Tang Dynasty.

611
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,690
I think so.

612
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,450
It’s hard to avoid being criticized

613
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,900
for showing it so fair and square.

614
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,930
As for this Nyuertu,

615
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,970
since the other party didn’t
make us more requirements,

616
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,730
I’ll make the decision now.

617
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,170
How about producing a batch

618
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,780
and sending it to Dongnyu State first?

619
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,750
What about it?

620
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,820
I think,

621
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,930
these are more vivid than those
from my master.

622
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,860
More wild fun.

623
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,780
The characters here are very vivid
and provocative.

624
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,580
Then arrange the production quickly.

625
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,140
Master, we don’t have enough raw silk.

626
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,780
Your career had developed very well,

627
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,620
but at that time,

628
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,730
you had no raw silk.

629
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,060
The silk reeling season has passed,

630
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,340
and silk is prone to insects,

631
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,340
so no one will stock more goods.

632
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,170
If in previous years,

633
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,930
everyone would have saved some silk.

634
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,380
But this time,

635
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,970
all the raw silk was forcibly taken away

636
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,930
by the government at a low price.

637
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,300
It was taken away by the government?

638
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,060
Yes.

639
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,970
It is said that the Sichuan raw silk
is of poor quality,

640
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,410
so they will produce silk in Jiangnan
in the future.

641
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,340
They have the final say?

642
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,250
Then why not pay tribute with the silk
from Jiangnan?

643
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:08,970
Because our Sichuan raw silk

644
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,970
is of good quality.

645
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,820
Why don’t you look for silk goods
in Southern City?

646
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,380
I heard that silkworm farmers
in Southern City

647
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,730
still have some raw cocoons.

648
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,450
I...

649
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,540
As he just said,

650
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,820
all the silks were taken away
by the government,

651
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,340
so I can’t get it though I go there.

652
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,010
Those are to be used as rearing shed,

653
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,930
and they are so important.

654
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,650
I’ll figure it out.

655
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,220
= Raw Silk Warehouse =

656
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,620
Your Highness, there is nothing.

657
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,250
Where is raw silk?

658
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,900
It was all collected, right?

659
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,690
Your Highness,

660
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,170
this raw silk is not easy to preserve,
so it turns bad.

661
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:05,780
Ridiculous!

662
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,980
Calm down, Your Highness.

663
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,580
Now we need raw silk,

664
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,930
you received it all but threw it away.

665
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,450
Why?

666
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,730
It is regular for Silver City
to collect silk.

667
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,010
Extra raw silk should be collected
every year.

668
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,930
Also to avoid the accumulation
and price reduction.

669
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,140
Almost all industries are like this,

670
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,820
and the court’s regulation for the market

671
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,010
can be reflected like this.

672
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,380
So where did you throw it?

673
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,930
I don’t know...

674
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,780
That place...

675
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,780
However, even if you find it,
it’s useless.

676
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,930
That’s right. You may rise.

677
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,150
Raw silk is best kept in this place.

681
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,080
When it comes to special preservation,

682
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,320
it can only be realized here.

683
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,250
Well,

684
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,170
you see, Your Highness,

685
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,690
this raw silk brings income every year.

686
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,820
But it’s usually collected
one month later.

687
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,820
Only this time it was collected
very early.

688
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,300
Different from as before.

689
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,260
That’s because new silk
will come out soon.

690
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,060
It’s OK for people to collect it
at a low price.

691
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,890
But this time,

692
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,450
he did these things

693
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,890
to bully Xinsilu.

694
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,650
But the raw silk

695
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,170
will be taken out in a few days.

696
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,500
If...

697
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,850
Of course, it was sold at a high price to

698
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,300
other places lacking silk.

699
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,580
Unfortunately,

700
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,170
there is no name on the raw silk,

701
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,340
so we can’t find its owner.

702
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,820
You say, in the Silver City,

703
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,740
who can take charge of
raw silk and pepper?

704
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,500
Look,

705
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,410
there are some vague records

706
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,650
on it,

707
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,980
which I didn’t notice before.

708
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,060
It seems that the whole black bank

709
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,690
belongs to Du Changfeng.

710
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,220
Then, Your Highness,

711
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,610
would you like to give these raw silk
to Miss Long?

712
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,820
The fish is so big

713
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,050
that I don’t want to scare it away.

714
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,180
= Bill on Credit =

715
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,940
= Today, give 1,000 tons high-quality
Huzhou Silk to Xinsilu Silk Store on credit =

716
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,570
Purchase orders on “critic”
for 1,000 tons superior Huzhou Silk.

717
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,340
“Credit”, the word is pronounced “credit”.

718
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

719
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,820
I should support it,

720
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,970
but it’s for Master Long at this time.

721
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,570
Master Li,

722
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,050
you even look down on
government investment.

723
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,780
My little support

724
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,530
is certainly nothing for you.

725
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,130
Good buddy.

726
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,530
That’s what brothers should do to help.

727
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,930
It works when it’s critical.

728
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,410
Who wants to be your brother?

729
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,410
Good things come in pairs.

730
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,050
Now that Your Highness have come for help,

731
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,700
I’ll do my best to help you.

732
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,200
Fatty, bring it up.

733
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,830
All right.

734
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,220
Look, what it is.

735
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,340
So many raw silks!

736
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,450
Where did you get it?

737
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,740
They belong to those silkworm farmers,

738
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,860
who take it out from silkworm varieties.

739
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,570
However,

740
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,900
these farmers contribute these to you,

741
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,860
their livelihood will depend
on you next year.

742
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,740
Of course.

743
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,820
I will repay them twice as much.

744
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,090
Anyway, your promise is just words,

745
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,820
and whether it can be fulfilled
depends on yourself.

746
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,570
Right.

747
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,250
Prince Zhao is so useful.

748
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,860
When the prince asks for help,

749
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,940
they dare not help.

750
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,380
It seems that your identity

751
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,210
does a little bit work.

752
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,860
Now that everything has been settled,

753
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,980
don’t worry about it.

754
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,460
Master Long, you promised me that.

755
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,730
I can’t forget. I have prepared for you.

756
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,690
What did you promise him?

757
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,060
None of your business.
You don’t need to know.

758
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,860
Your Highness, let’s go.

759
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,500
Here we go.

760
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,170
Wait.

761
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,730
I can wait for you to do business,

762
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,650
but if something happens later,

763
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,610
where can I find you?

764
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,810
Where else could it be?

765
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,940
Of course, the place that makes you blush.

766
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,500
Wuyun Pavilion...

767
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,650
= Du’s Mansion =

768
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,130
Father.

769
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,170
The housekeeper tells me that you let me
go to Chang’an first.

770
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,540
But I still have a lot of luggage to pack.

771
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,500
Moreover,

772
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,290
Xinsilu still needs to be handed over.

773
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,460
Xiaoxian,

774
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,810
when you get to Chang’an,

775
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,690
I’ll buy you a better one.

776
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,500
Don’t take anything but money.

777
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,020
As for Xinsilu,

778
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,690
just sell it quickly.

779
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,810
It’s not a flight.

780
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,460
Why leave in such a hurry?

781
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,380
You don’t understand.

782
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,020
This time I go to work in Chang’an.

783
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,690
Many people are supervising me.

784
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,250
If the settlement is not clear,

785
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,130
do I have to wait for someone
to set a trap for me?

786
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,130
More importantly,

787
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,980
prepare gifts in advance

788
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,210
to visit the Empress Dowager
and Concubine De.

789
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,810
As the daughter of the imperial official,

790
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,420
you should set your sights high,

791
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,170
and don’t always care
about the Silver City and Xinsilu.

792
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,810
Understand?

793
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,500
