32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,870
Ma’am.

33
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,560
Young man,

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,400
who are you looking for?

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,680
Is Miss Long here?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Miss Long?

37
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,800
She went out earlier.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,080
I came in a hurry,

39
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,360
I didn’t know Miss Long went out.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,190
Sorry for disturbing you.

41
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,590
Please pardon me.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,710
Young man, you are not only good in looks

43
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,400
but also polite.

44
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,400
Come in, please. Come in.

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,750
OK.

46
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,150
Please.

47
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,400
Sorry for my humble home.

48
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,430
Not at all.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
Young man, take a seat.

50
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,870
I’ll make you some tea.

51
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,590
Thank you, Ma’am.

52
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,800
Sit down. It’ll be quick.

53
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,800
Truly a foodie.

54
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,590
Young Master,

55
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,520
why are you here?

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,950
Your Highness, you…

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
I’m here for Miss Long.

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,310
She’s not here.

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,390
I was going to leave,

60
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,120
but

61
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,070
I couldn’t find Wu Lin.

62
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,560
Your Highness.

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
According to your order,

64
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,070
I have put the grape wine…

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,040
there.

66
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,510
Forget it.

67
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,000
Let’s go.

68
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Wait, Your Highness.

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,950
You’re here already.

70
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,600
And you have looked around.

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Why don’t you stay and have dinner?

72
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,830
You

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,190
and me?

74
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,830
After Your Highness came to Silver City,

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
you have been good to our Xinsilu.

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,270
I should show my gratitude of course.

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Otherwise, the others would think

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,430
I’m not treating a guest properly.

79
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,000
OK.

80
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,000
Wu Lin,

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,800
bring the wine I brought for Miss Long.

82
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,750
Let’s get hammered tonight.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,430
The number of the first batch
of silk cocoons is 1,088.

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,480
One thousand and eight… Eight…

85
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,400
Eight…

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,750
eighty…

87
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,430
Fine ones are 788.

88
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,870
788.

89
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,750
The purchasing price is 5 coins for 10.

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,920
5 coins…

91
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,830
As a person who doesn’t

92
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,720
even know how many coins consist of a string,

93
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,310
she’s actually using an abacus.

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,950
I think she wants the silkworm eggs
to be supplied soon,

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,870
so people can make money.

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Chief!

97
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,190
Second Master.

98
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,070
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,310
Chief,

100
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
the second batch has also arrived.

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,560
Please take a look.

102
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,830
OK, the other batches will come soon.

103
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,510
We must deliver some
to the silk manor tonight.

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:20,950
All right.

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,750
I was surprised about

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,000
your invitation this time.

107
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,800
Your Highness, you have been

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
conscientious in my silk store

109
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,270
for the tax inspection.

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,360
It’s only natural for me

111
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,360
to show my gratitude.

112
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,680
Gratitude?

113
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,310
If you want me to deblock
your countinghouse,

114
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
you can ask directly.

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,830
We audit our accounts

116
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,430
three times a month.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
Now the government

118
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
is willing to audit it again for us,

119
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,070
to me,

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
there’s no loss.

121
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I invited Your Highness to this dinner

122
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
to make clear one thing.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,430
That is whatever I do,

124
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,680
I’ll try my best and spare no effort.

125
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,480
And I never beg.

126
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,430
Never beg, well said.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,190
I have a question in my heart.

128
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,190
In our Tang territory today,

129
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,950
numerous businessmen are gaining strength.

130
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,630
Officialdom is the natural outlet

131
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,160
for successful businessmen.

132
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
Master Li,

133
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,240
do you want to be an official too?

134
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,390
Simple wealth

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,390
is no match for power.

136
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
But I only know business.

137
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
My greatest dream

138
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,160
is to dig deeper into Sichuan embroidery.

139
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,390
Eight years of chaos

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,190
has damaged the country greatly.

141
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,680
The royal court has been so busy.

142
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,560
I never liked handling state affairs.

143
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,120
I’d rather enjoy myself
in a beautiful view.

144
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,270
But as a prince,

145
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,120
I don’t have a choice.

146
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,310
Although Li Family is wealthy now,

147
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,720
there will be a decline sooner or later.

148
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
When I started learning business,

149
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,550
I knew I could

150
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,910
help our family for
at most a hundred years.

151
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,870
It looks like we both have our worries.

152
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,390
We are just in different positions.

153
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
Moreover, I’m

154
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,480
enjoying this.

155
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,140
= Grape Wine =

156
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,870
Don’t let this happen again.

157
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,270
Yes.

158
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,910
Get out.

159
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,320
Master Li,

160
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,670
you seem not too gentle to girls.

161
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,630
She’s just a maid.

162
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,960
It seems like

163
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,910
my chance

164
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,080
to get Miss Long is bigger.

165
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,320
Long Aoyi?

166
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,600
I don’t like

167
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,150
that kind of rough girl.

168
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,750
Now that we are going to get hammered,

169
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
why don’t we use bigger cups?

170
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,240
Now that Your Highness says so,

171
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,630
let’s drink seriously.

172
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,150
Servants! Big cups!

173
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,940
See you next time.

174
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,510
Xiaoqin, I’ll see you
in the teahouse at 2 p.m.

175
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,510
Teahouse? What do you mean?

176
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,790
You little brat!

177
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,030
You are too young to date.

178
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,550
That man gave me a coin and asked me

179
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,550
to deliver the message.

180
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,750
He said he’d see you there.

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,910
OK, I got it.

182
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
But remember,

183
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,240
if that man asks you

184
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
to deliver a message again,

185
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,030
ask for two coins,

186
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,750
got it?

187
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,120
OK.

188
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,030
Go ahead.

189
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,360
Master Li, you deserve to be called

190
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,840
the wealthiest businessman in Silver City.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
These big cups

192
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,910
are truly big.

193
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,720
Your Highness, are you scared?

194
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
Scared of what? Cheers!

195
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,200
Cheers!

196
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,240
Actually,

197
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,150
I’m not good at drinking.

198
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,390
I can drink three cups at most.

199
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,510
You know what?

200
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,910
I like Miss Long.

201
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,600
That’s good.

202
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,630
You are lying.

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
You said you could only drink three cups.

204
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I was counting.

205
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,750
That was your third cup.

206
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,100
= The Best Sword Is the First =

207
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,960
Not handsome enough.

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,550
Manager Yan.

209
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,720
Greetings, Manager Yan.

210
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,910
Miss Su.

211
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,080
The Best Sword Is the First.

212
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,840
I knew you liked novels.

213
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,270
Judging from the name of this book,

214
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,390
it’s interesting.

215
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Can I borrow it?

216
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,150
If you like novels,

217
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,080
I can give you another one.

218
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,550
But this one…

219
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,510
You are giving it to me?

220
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,240
But...

221
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,870
Thank you then, Manager Yan.

222
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,120
No, that’s…

223
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,840
Xiaoqin.

224
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,840
This young lady is…

225
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,480
I’m Xiaoqin.

226
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,390
Xiaoqin.

227
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,750
Manager Yan,

228
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,320
how did you know

229
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,510
such a rough girl?

230
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,670
So you asked me to come

231
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,390
to see you flirt with a girl?

232
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,390
- Let me tell you,
- No…

233
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,320
I’m too busy for that.

234
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,030
Goodbye.

235
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,200
Wait a minute! Wait!

236
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,750
Listen to me. I can explain.

237
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,720
What’s there to explain?

238
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,840
That Miss Su

239
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,870
is waiting for you.

240
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,390
= The Best Sword Is the First =
This is for you.

241
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,630
What do you mean?

242
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,390
You took back what you gave another girl

243
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,550
and give it to me?

244
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,670
What am I to you? A junk dealer?

245
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,960
This was for you in the first place.

246
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,870
But I just saw…

247
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,240
She mistook it.

248
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,550
It took me several nights to write it.

249
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
I never liked writing,

250
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,670
so how could I possibly

251
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,080
give it to someone
who doesn’t understand it?

252
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,630
Really?

253
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,910
I swear.

254
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,780
= The Best Sword Is the First =

255
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,320
Actually, I want to take the chance
of giving you this book

256
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,870
to apologize to you

257
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,390
for what I said the other day

258
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
at the entrance of the silk store.

259
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,550
I’m sorry.

260
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,720
I made you upset.

261
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,080
If there’s something on your mind,

262
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,630
you can tell me.

263
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,840
I would be honored to listen to it.

264
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,790
Before I met My Lady,

265
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
I was homeless for some time.

266
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
Because my dad…

267
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,910
he abandoned my mom,

268
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,460
who died not long after that.

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,600
For as long as I can remember,

270
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,750
I knew that

271
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,480
whenever my dad was not happy,

272
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,630
he would beat my mom.

273
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,150
My mom could do nothing

274
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
but cry.

275
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,150
Her health became worse and worse.

276
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,360
I wanted to protect her.

277
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,870
So I went to the temple nearby

278
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,910
to learn martial arts from monks.

279
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
One day,

280
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
my dad was beating my mom again.

281
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,600
I couldn’t stand it anymore,

282
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,960
so I punched him.

283
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
He couldn’t believe it at first,

284
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,150
and then tried to strangle me.

285
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,030
I was so terrified,

286
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,150
so I used my full force

287
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,600
to shove him to the ground.

288
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,030
He stood up,

289
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,840
stared at me fiercely

290
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,630
and said I was a jinx.

291
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
He said I would scare off

292
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,630
all people around me,

293
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,200
and I would end up alone.

294
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,320
What kind of father could say that?

295
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,080
The next day, my dad ran away.

296
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,150
He abandoned me and my mom.

297
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,840
I never saw him again

298
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
even after my mom’s death.

299
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,030
That’s my story.

300
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,550
In The Best Sword Is the First,
Emperor Xuan of Han

301
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,000
neglected all dissenting views

302
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,080
and made his original wife Empress.

303
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,150
That’s about the

304
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,120
long-standing love
between husband and wife.

305
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,750
I don’t know

306
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,390
why my dad treated my mom like that.

307
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,630
I just can’t figure out why.

308
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,080
So that’s why you like

309
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,790
this story.

310
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
I…

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,840
Recently, I’ve learnt

312
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,960
another good story,

313
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,720
let me tell it to you.

314
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,030
How much did you drink? It’s too late.

315
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,880
Just go back and rest.

316
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,310
= Xinsilu =
You send me back.

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
OK, I’ll send you back.

318
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,310
Why am I so unlucky?

319
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,270
I didn’t get to drink

320
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,830
but I have to deal with a drunkard.

321
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,380
That way!

322
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,200
Miss Long,

323
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
do you have somebody

324
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,070
you like?

325
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,070
What’s with the hesitation?

326
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Could it be…

327
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,510
You need to wipe your mouth.

328
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,820
= Xinsilu =

329
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,880
Listen.

330
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,350
In my eyes,

331
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,960
all men are my brothers.

332
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,550
We can eat, drink and earn money together.

333
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,880
As for the affections
between men and women,

334
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,030
those are all meaningless.

335
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,790
Your Highness. Your Highness.

336
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,000
She’s gone.

337
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,030
Talking about my quick wit.

338
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,160
I can’t accept to be rejected like that.

339
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,400
Come on.

340
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
What did we drink?

341
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,400
I’m having a headache.

342
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,880
Help me back.

343
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,510
Come on.

344
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,070
Didn’t you go back?

345
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,310
I can only deal with one drunkard a day.

346
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,200
You can help yourself!

347
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,720
- What are you doing? Let go!
- If the heaven didn’t love wine,

348
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,960
there would be no god of wine.
If the earth didn’t love wine,

349
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,030
there would be no wine spring.

350
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,400
Now that the heaven and the earth both love wine,
there’s nothing wrong with me loving it.

351
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,070
Sure.

352
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,110
You love wine.

353
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,440
Let go of me, OK?

354
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,160
No way, send me back to my room.

355
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,830
That’s Yan Bin’s job.

356
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,160
Why are you doing this to me?

357
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,640
Let go!

358
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,310
Don’t go. Don’t go.

359
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,850
Don’t go.

360
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,070
I thought you couldn’t touch women.

361
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
You were faking it?

362
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,720
You look decent in front of people,

363
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,880
yet you have so many eccentricities.

364
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,440
Bro, I’m exhausted.

365
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,110
What’s wrong with my bed?

366
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,550
Why am I seeing stars?

367
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,030
I also start

368
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,640
seeing stars in my eyes.

369
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,200
Dude, wake up!

370
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,640
I need to get you back to your room.

371
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,160
Get up! Get…

372
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,790
Get up! Why are you so heavy?

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,640
Your Highness.

374
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,000
We have already arrested
the corrupt official,

375
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,440
and he has admitted everything.

376
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,880
Why are we here again?

377
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
I heard from the waiter that

378
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,310
they launched a new dish, stewed turtle.

379
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,200
Don’t you want to try?

380
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,790
What do you mean?

381
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,640
Just...

382
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,030
If you want to make Long Aoyi happy,

383
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,550
you could have brought her directly.

384
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,070
How can I do that?

385
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,270
What if the new dish is not good?

386
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
I need to try it on you first.

387
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,070
Miss Long really helped us a lot.

388
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,240
She provided the clue

389
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,030
and we found

390
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,880
a big batch of pepper thanks to it.

391
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,720
However,

392
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,510
judging by Miss Long’s reaction
last night,

393
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,440
I don’t think you stand a chance.

394
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
What are you thinking?

395
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,550
Tell me,

396
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,440
what’s our purpose here in Silver City?

397
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,880
Tax inspection.

398
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,790
And?

399
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,790
Pepper.

400
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,110
That’s right.

401
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,590
We can’t inspect Mr. Zhu’s tax yet.

402
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
That might alert our real enemy.

403
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,240
We need to uncover what’s behind him.

404
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,920
You are right, Your Highness.

405
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,110
Sir.

406
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,440
Sir, please wait.

407
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,400
Don’t worry. I mean no harm.

408
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,160
How do you know who I am?

409
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,200
Xiaoliu who works in the kitchen

410
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,200
saw you days ago

411
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
with Master Long.

412
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,830
He told me.

413
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,030
Miss Long saved our lives.

414
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,590
Don’t worry. I’ll keep your secret.

415
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,160
That’s interesting.

416
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,640
You said

417
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,270
Miss Long saved your life?

418
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,440
What do you mean?

419
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,790
This is not a place to talk.

420
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,590
Let’s get inside.

421
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,920
He is Xiaoliu.

422
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,070
Four years ago, we came to Silver City
as refugees.

423
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,240
We were very sick.

424
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,680
If Miss Long hadn’t saved us,

425
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,550
we could have gone for long.

426
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,830
I didn’t expect that

427
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,000
the kitchen of this restaurant

428
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,640
is actually a branch of Longzhu Gang.

429
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,110
You misunderstood, Sir.

430
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,240
We are not members of Longzhu Gang.

431
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,310
But

432
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,510
we all received Master Long’s help.

433
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,510
What do you mean?

434
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,790
Although Silver City

435
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,720
looks peaceful and prosperous,

436
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,030
many ordinary people here

437
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,640
are plundered by government on one side,

438
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and bullied by hooligans from Snake Gang
on the other side.

439
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,240
People are all suffering.

440
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,200
Only Longzhu Gang

441
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,510
is helping the people.

442
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,270
If it weren’t for them,

443
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,510
many more people

444
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,590
would have become helpless

445
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,030
and homeless.

446
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
What Mr. Zhu wants is the customs seal.

447
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,750
But I won’t give him the chance.

448
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,400
The real problem now

449
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
is to resume production.

450
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,790
As long as the operation of the silk store
can be resumed,

451
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,680
everything will get back to normal.

452
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
But

453
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
our countinghouse is closed

454
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,640
and many kinds of materials have run out.

455
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,240
We don’t have another choice

456
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,350
other than waiting.

457
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,590
You are right.

458
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,030
Now

459
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,830
we don’t have money or materials,

460
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,030
so we need a perfect idea.

461
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
We have to figure out a creative product

462
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,920
which doesn’t need too much investment.

463
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,550
As for the product,

464
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,480
I’m thinking about the underclothes

465
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,790
from Numan State.

466
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,400
But I don’t think Xiaowu and the others

467
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,350
are suitable for women’s underclothes.

468
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,400
We need a girl,

469
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,110
a smart and lively one,

470
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,030
who can help unite us together

471
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,680
in such a critical moment.

472
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,590
A girl who won’t ask for too much,

473
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,350
and is willing to work hard.

474
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,720
A fat guy fell to his death

475
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,110
and became a dead fat guy.

476
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:20,790
Take it.

477
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,110
Keep going.

478
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,720
You are slacking off again.

479
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,270
If your Master saw you,

480
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,350
he would deduct your wages.

481
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,640
Did that wake you up?

482
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,240
Take it.

483
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,160
Do your work.

484
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,830
You are obviously talking about
Master Long.

485
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,030
Keeping her

486
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,440
is for the sake of our silk store’s

487
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,350
development.

488
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,400
Doing more jobs with less

489
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,920
human cost,

490
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,200
that’s how you earn money.

491
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,270
But, will she consent to it?

492
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,920
Don’t worry about that.

493
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,550
She’ll come to us.

494
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,720
Our first priority is to

495
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,510
produce that product

496
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,790
and earn some quick money.

497
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,310
I’ll give you another two days.

498
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,400
In two days,

499
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,830
if you still can’t make the design,

500
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,000
you’ll all be fired.

501
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,550
The gold thread has been found,

502
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,310
why was he still yelling at you?

503
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,110
Although the gold thread is found,

504
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,070
the season’s changing,

505
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,720
it’s time for us to launch new designs.

506
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,110
But the countinghouse is sealed,

507
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,400
so we don’t have the money
for materials for new designs.

508
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,310
Master Li ordered us

509
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,350
to make new designs
out of old materials in stock.

510
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,680
It sounds serious.

511
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,200
It is.

512
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,030
But what Master Li wants us to alter

513
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,920
is the women underclothes of Numan State.

514
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,270
It’s new to everybody.

515
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,000
So we are all confused.

516
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,810
Let me help you take a look.

517
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,510
You’re up.

518
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,160
The first batch of raw silk has arrived.

519
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,240
Check it up when you have time.

520
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,590
And...

521
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,830
you sleepwalked last night.

522
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,400
When did I sleepwalk?

523
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,480
He’s trying to deny it.

524
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,310
After finishing a whole jar of grape wine,

525
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,200
you passed out.

526
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,350
It’s me

527
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,880
who saved you in the spirit of humanity

528
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,240
and dragged you back to your room.

529
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
You even bruised my leg.

530
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,750
Impossible.

531
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,720
You don’t believe it?

532
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,200
Come on, I’ll show you.

533
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,830
Never mind.

534
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,480
No need to say thank you.

535
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,510
I want a reward.

536
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,640
No? OK then.

537
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,440
Goodbye.

538
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:44,920
Wait!

539
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,790
This is what I use when I

540
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,640
get pricked by needle. It works well.

541
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,640
Apply it and go sweep the floor.

542
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,300
Look.

543
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,070
I’ve never seen something like this.

544
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,560
Right.

545
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,070
How should you put it on?

546
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,840
It looks pretty nice though.

547
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
How do you put it on?

548
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,480
I don’t know.

549
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,160
That’s weird.

550
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,750
Why do they wear this?

551
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,790
It can’t keep you warm.

552
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,510
And it’s like a big cocoon.

553
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,530
That’s strange.

554
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,240
Say it.

555
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,270
The song those

556
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,030
singing girls always sing,

557
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,680
Buddhist Dancers, you don’t know?

558
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,750
You know nothing.

559
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,830
What did you say? Just continue!

560
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,270
It’s… I mean…

561
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,310
It’s about the private things

562
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,000
happened between a couple.

563
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,440
I heard it from Master.

564
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,640
I don’t understand it.

565
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,680
I’m still young.

566
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,960
Miss Long!

567
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,860
= Jiannan Spring =

568
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,510
Coming!

569
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,480
= Jiannan Spring =

570
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,790
Tasty!

571
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,480
Tasty!

572
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,440
Is there any new progress
about that pepper thing?

573
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,070
There must be a bigger fish behind it.

574
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,750
Your clue helped a lot.

575
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,440
That’s just a coincidence.

576
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,550
Don’t mention it.

577
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,110
Too bad you were not here last night.

578
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,200
I’ll make it up for you.
This is the first step.

579
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,030
So,

580
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,240
there will be a second and a third step?

581
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,160
You bet.

582
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,310
Today, it’s roasted chicken
and Jiannan Spring.

583
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,960
You can ask for whatever you want
for tomorrow.

584
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,720
The mangosteens from Southern City.

585
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,880
You like mangosteens?

586
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,640
I’ve been so busy,
they can remove my internal heat.

587
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,590
Besides, I’m working on

588
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,000
some weird clothes.

589
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,960
Weird clothes?

590
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,750
I’ll show you after eating.

591
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,510
Cheers.

592
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,010
Cheers.

593
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,480
Nice!

594
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,310
Nice!

595
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,200
I’ve seen this in the imperial court.

596
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,960
If I recall correctly,

597
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,070
this was a tribute

598
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,240
from the Numan State.

599
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,550
It’s pretty rare for sure.

600
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,750
I think I saw Miss Hu wear it last year.

601
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,590
Now that you saw a girl wear it,

602
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,000
how did it feel when you touch it?

603
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,830
I never touched or wore it,

604
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,640
how should I know how it felt?

605
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,160
Didn’t that Miss Hu tell you

606
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,830
about if she was comfortable or not?

607
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,750
Why would she tell me?

608
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,200
It’s not me who asked her to wear it.

609
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,750
Why are you laughing? I swear!

610
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,440
OK.

611
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,270
Also,

612
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,000
this design doesn’t look so good.

613
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,590
It’s like the fish leather clothes
fishermen wear.

614
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,000
Don’t cut it.

615
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,680
Back off, all of you!

616
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,110
Why not?

617
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,350
A bunch of men

618
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,400
surrounding a woman, what are you doing?

619
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,510
Since it’s underclothes,

620
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,720
it shouldn’t be like

621
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,720
outerwear.

622
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,350
It just needs to be comfortable.

623
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,750
Nice! Another kind of beauty.

624
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,240
Half covered and half exposed.

625
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,000
This is just that kind of women’s beauty

626
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,640
Feng said the other day.

627
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,160
Master talked to you about this?

628
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,350
But I cut it

629
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,720
not for its looks,

630
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,400
but for women’s flexibility.

631
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,510
You’ll see what I mean.

632
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,510
That’s interesting.

633
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,830
Why don’t we

634
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,720
launch it?

635
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,160
If we bring this out and sell it,

636
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,110
we’ll be arrested for

637
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,350
harming the decency.

638
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,640
Master Long,

639
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,920
should we tell Master Li

640
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,160
about the alternation to the clothes?

641
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,680
He might blame us for this.

642
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,270
We don’t have time
to wait for his consent.

643
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,880
All right.

644
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,270
Go back to your work now.

645
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,680
Come on. Let’s go.

646
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,750
It’s really nice.

647
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,400
Your Highness, don’t you think
I’m talented?

648
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,110
Of course.

649
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,590
But I also helped with what I said, right?

650
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,270
Yeah, of course.

651
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:18,880
By the way,

652
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,440
you are of great influence,
you can help sell it.

653
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,680
Why don’t we make some to sell

654
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,830
to relieve the pressure of the silk manor?

655
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,400
You are not a member of Xinsilu,

656
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,920
why do you care?

657
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
But my money…

658
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,030
Your money?

659
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,070
I mean

660
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,720
I’m not for making money.

661
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,920
Moreover, the financial condition

662
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,550
of Xinsilu has nothing to do with me.

663
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,590
You don’t know.

664
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,400
I had a dream about

665
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,590
costume designing since I was little.

666
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,030
I tried changing buttons for my shoes,

667
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,000
and making a skirt into trousers.

668
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,030
I even made some straw figures.

669
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,000
Now I finally

670
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,240
got a chance to perform.

671
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,920
Look, right?

672
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,590
You can make straw figures?

673
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,350
You don’t believe me?

674
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,640
I can make kittens, puppies,
piggies and birds.

675
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,920
I’ll show you.

676
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
You are the prince of Tang.

677
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,800
This golden carp is for you.

678
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,630
It’s good!

679
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,510
Since you gave me a gift,

680
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,960
I’ll give you something for exchange.

681
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,150
Don’t worry about the sale

682
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,230
of the underclothes, I’ll try.

683
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Thank you!

684
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,670
Your Highness,

685
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,710
why don’t you buy them out?

686
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,960
I thought about it, but it’s cheating.

687
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,030
Miss Long would not be happy about it.

688
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,440
How about this?

689
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,760
Let’s issue an edict

690
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,510
to order everyone in Silver City
to buy one.

691
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,070
That’s too high-handed.

692
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,590
Your Highness, there’s something
I don’t understand.

693
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,400
By helping sell the underclothes,

694
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,920
you are actually helping Xinsilu.

695
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,190
But Master Li…

696
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,840
Master Li is not important.

697
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,150
Who’s important is Miss Long.

698
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,760
Now she asked for my help,

699
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,000
why not?

700
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,880
I can do

701
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,400
what Master Li can’t.

702
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,450
Yes.

703
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,710
Look at that.

704
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,280
The concubines in the imperial palace

705
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,630
like to predict my father’s thoughts

706
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,400
with divination.

707
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,210
= I draw present and predict the future =

708
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,060
= Ten coins for a drawing
and fortunetelling is for free =

709
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,460
= Precise Prediction of the Future =

710
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,710
You get what you ask for
and lose what you give up.

711
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,110
Ma’am, what do you want to know?

712
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,150
My Lady wants to ask about her marriage.

713
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,070
Shut up!

714
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,590
When you see a chance,

715
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,480
grab it. Whenever there’s a chance,

716
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,000
you can’t let it go.

717
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,030
That’s how you do it.

718
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,760
You get what you ask for,

719
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
and lose what you give up.

720
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,510
You can’t let a chance

721
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,320
slip away.

722
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,670
Explain it.

723
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,510
Ma’am, as long as
you can seize the chance,

724
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,150
you and your husband
can spend your whole life together.

725
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,710
Wonderful!

726
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,000
My Lady, that means you and Master

727
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,960
can get back together.

728
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,880
However,

729
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,590
judging from the divination,

730
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,230
it’s not the best result.

731
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,800
I’m not sure if you can seize the chance.

732
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,440
What should I do?

733
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,880
Don’t worry, I have a solution.

734
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,670
This kind of underclothes is not decent,
I can’t wear this.

735
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,800
That’s not what you should worry about.

736
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,440
Once your husband lost interest in you,

737
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,920
he would marry

738
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,000
his second, third, fourth,
fifth and sixth wives.

739
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,150
Isn’t that scary?

740
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,110
What do you say?

741
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,230
Seize your chance!

742
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,800
Impressive!

743
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,500
= Xinsilu =

744
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,880
It was made by Master Long.

745
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,880
I can take this.

746
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,000
After the past days,

747
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,440
I’ve found that your clothes

748
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
are surely of great quality.

749
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,150
Before, I thought it was crazy

750
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,800
to make clothes out of some cloth

751
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,710
and sell them at such a high price.

752
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,840
But now I understand.

753
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,480
All the pleats and side seams

754
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,630
are carefully designed and made.

755
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,000
Right.

756
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
But I have to say,

757
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,670
your master’s brains

758
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,190
must have gone mouldy.

759
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,190
He just can’t forget those

760
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,880
complicated designs.

761
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,230
Look at the horse dealers in the market.

762
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,880
They are all wearing
separate tops and trousers.

763
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,230
It’s obviously more practical

764
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,590
than long gowns on horseback.

765
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,670
You scared me to death!

766
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,920
Of course, my brains have gone mouldy.

767
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,920
Tomorrow is the deadline I set.

768
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,840
Where’s the underclothes?

769
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,510
Master, Mr. Zhu is here.

770
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,630
He asks to see you.

771
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,070
I’ll be back soon.

772
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,630
Continue.

773
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,590
Right when the government
is regulating folk custom,

774
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,760
this kind of indecent underclothes

775
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,230
is being sold to the top nine genres.

776
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,550
It’s said that it’s from your silk store.

777
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,960
Explain it.

778
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
The fabric

779
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,150
is the brocade of our silk store.

780
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,630
But we never had this kind of design.

781
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,190
Mr. Zhu,

782
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,920
people tend to believe
what they hear or see.

783
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,510
But what you hear
is sometimes unauthentic.

784
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,110
Please don’t jump to conclusion

785
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,960
just for what you heard.

786
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,630
The fabric belongs to you.

787
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,550
That means

788
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,710
the source of this

789
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,400
is Xinsilu,

790
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,760
am I right?

791
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,590
Right.

792
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,920
Then it’s right for me

793
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,760
to punish you.

794
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,710
Mr. Zhu, please give me some time.

795
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,110
I’ll figure this out.

796
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,150
Miss Long.

797
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,280
It’s you. You’ve got news?

798
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,880
Right.

799
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,920
His Highness asked me to tell you

800
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,320
that 100 sets had been ordered.

801
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,360
The customers will come in person

802
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,550
to place their orders.

803
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,070
Really? Not bad.

804
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,590
Thank him for me.

805
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,760
Great!

806
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,190
The money invested on gold thread

807
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,150
cannot recover soon.

808
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,590
But there’s finally a chance
to get my money back.

809
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,710
My baby!

810
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,400
The thing about underclothes
has alarmed the government.

811
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,800
Mr. Zhu came last night
to ask for an explanation.

812
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,110
It’s having a crippling effect on us.

813
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,880
Who did this? Admit it.

814
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,670
Who sold this kind of indecent clothes

815
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,800
in the name of Xinsilu?

816
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,000
Nobody is standing out? OK.

817
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,880
Everybody that is involved in this,

818
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,280
pack up your stuff and leave.

819
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,480
What do you mean indecent?

820
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,880
How come it’s indecent?

821
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,360
Of course it’s you.

822
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,110
Master Long,

823
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,280
did somebody send you here

824
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,110
to ruin our Xinsilu’s reputation?

825
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,030
His Highness was also there
when we altered it.

826
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,630
Who’s the one that cut it?

827
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,150
It’s…

828
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,800
Anyway,

829
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,630
His Highness said

830
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,000
we should try to sell some samples.

831
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,360
It has nothing to do with Prince Zhao.

832
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,760
It’s me who designed it
and supervised the production.

833
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,110
I thought, what if it sells well?

834
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Like 100, or even 200?

835
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,800
Master Long,

836
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,320
I don’t understand

837
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,550
how you do things in your world.

838
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,920
But you should at least be loyal.

839
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,550
Although you and Qingliu
were never friends,

840
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,030
he never did anything harmful to you.

841
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,840
He brought you back to the silk manor

842
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,510
and supported you with
nice food and drinks.

843
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,510
With this indecent thing

844
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,230
you designed,

845
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,880
you are ruining us.

846
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,800
Why are you all blaming me?

847
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,510
This is for women, right?

848
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,440
My master once told me,

849
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,630
when the Emperor liked slender waist,

850
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,840
maids in imperial palace

851
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,920
girdled their waists with cloth strips

852
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,510
until they became as slender as a bowl.

853
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,670
Here comes the question.

854
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,030
Are women dressed up

855
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,800
for ourselves

856
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,920
or for men?

857
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,150
Besides,

858
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
that is pretty tight already,

859
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,880
but there’s lacing in the back.

860
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,190
- No one can put it on without help.
- That’s right.

861
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:02,770
Exactly.

862
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,030
For a wealthy lady like you,

863
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,110
there’s no problem of course.

864
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,320
But for ordinary people,

865
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,880
they don’t have maids to help them.

866
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,480
Who are you implying?

867
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,070
Master Long.

868
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,880
Selling one hundred
to you second nine genres

869
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,360
is worse than selling one
to the top nine genres.

870
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,840
The clothes of our Xinsilu

871
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,630
were never meant for
you second nine genres.

872
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,670
Sure, clothes should look nice.

873
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
But they should also be
comfortable and practical.

874
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,840
When Master Li

875
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,630
altered the

876
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,280
cuffs of that

877
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,550
begonia dress,

878
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,400
it’s also for the convenience
of those who wear it.

879
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,190
So tell me,

880
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,800
does that have anything to do
with your class?

881
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,590
Xiaoxian.

882
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,000
You may leave with the others.

883
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,030
Go!

884
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:01,630
You.

885
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,440
