Someone reported Long Aoyi

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,790
because

42
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,470
he wants to hide the fact that
Long Aoyi and I have known the truth.

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,240
Long wasn’t born from a noble family.

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,030
She is unruly, but she is kind in nature.

She only wants to be with me.

46

She doesn’t understand

the seriousness of lying about
bearing a royal heir.

48

What she did

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,240
is disrespectful.

50
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,670
She should be punished.

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,870
But it was my idea to hide it.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,730
I am the one

53
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,230

77
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,810
I know I committed a crime.

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,610
I’m very regretful.

79
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,880
But I have my own difficulties.

80
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,870
When I was in Silver City,

81
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,310
I started to admire Prince Jun.

82
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,240
Thinking that I can’t stay
with him forever,

83
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,960
I feel hopeless.

84
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,310
I don’t want to live without him
for another minute.

85
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,630
That’s why I came up with this idea.

86
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,960
I really want to be with Prince Jun.

87
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,000
Your Majesty.

88
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,030
Please understand my lovesickness.

89
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,710
I don’t care what your intention is.

90
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,360
You did commit a crime of deceiving me.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,080
You should be beheaded!

92
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,870
It’s my fault.

93
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,190
In fact, it’s all my idea.

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,430
Long was pregnant once.

95
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,470
But she lost the baby

96
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,630
because of an accident.

97
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,120
To not let Father and Grandmother worry,

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,750
I just hid it from you.

99
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,750
I want to wait until
Long gets pregnant again

100
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,590
and tell you the facts then.

101
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,000
I know I committed huge crime
of deceiving Father.

102
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,800
But I’m too afraid of
being separated from Long.

103
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,360
It has nothing to do with Long.

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
I am willing to take all the punishments.

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,080
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
Please summon the maid
of Prince Jun’s Mansion, Ezi.

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,840
Summon the maid Ezi!

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,030
Your Majesty.

109
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,390
Long Aoyi made these
to pretend to be pregnant.

110
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,270
These are for three-month
and five-month pregnancy.

111
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,560
Long Aoyi made these
without telling Prince Jun.

112
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,950
Xiaoxian.

113
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,830

115
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,680
Are you still going to help her?

116
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,070
It’s not an accident at all.

117
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,240
She faked the pregnancy deliberately.

118
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,000
Your Highness, Long Aoyi
did it by herself.

119
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,040
It has nothing to do with Prince Jun.

120
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,360
Are you still denying it?

121
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,070
Prince Jun, no need to
try to exonerate me.

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,560
I did it, I’m willing to bear the result.

123
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,040
Prince Jun has nothing to do with it.

124
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,240
Come on.

125
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,510
Take her out and behead her.

126
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,290
Your Majesty!

127
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
If I may be so bold as to
beg mercy for Lady Long.

128
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,800
Since Lady Long came to the Palace,

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
she solved a lot of difficulties
for the concubines.

130
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,950
The harem is peaceful.

131
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,630
The servants work harder than before.

132
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
Isn’t the Consort Dowager

133
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,950
healthier than before?

134
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,430
Father!

135
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,360
Lady Long and I are good friends.

136
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,310
I believe what she did
is a one-time lapse.

137
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,600
Besides, Qinglong Firm first
built the water transportation system,

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
stabilized the rice price
and quelled popular indignation,

139
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,610
then it solved the
food shortage in Chang’an.

140
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,510
She saved so many lives.

141
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,950
Can her life

142
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,020
be saved by it?

143
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,720
Please spare Prince Jun.

144
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,000
- Your Majesty, please spare Lady Long.
- Your Majesty, please spare Lady Long.

145
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,430
Father, please spare Lady Long.

146
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,040
Wise Your Majesty.

147
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,190
This woman padded her belly
to pretend to be pregnant,

148
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,560
who knows what she would use

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
to pretend to be the royal heir.

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,270
What Long Aoyi did

151
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,920
tainted the blood of our royal family.

152
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,630
It is a monstrous crime.

153
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,560
Long Aoyi.

154
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,800
You deceived me first,

155
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,310
now you presume upon
your services and become haughty.

156
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,480
Come on.

157
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,270
Take her out and behead her!

158
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,920
Hold on.

159
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,750
The days in the Palace are the same.

160
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,190
Not as unfettered as dragon in the sky.

161
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,510
Your Majesty. It’s all about destiny.

162
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,120
Our fate with Long is over.

163
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,830
Why don’t you let her go back
where she came from?

164
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,390
Long Aoyi, good for you.

165
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,270
All these people spoke up for you,

166
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
All right.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,390
I will spare you from death.

168
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,030
But,

169
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,240
from now on,

170
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,630
you will only be a civilian.

171
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,790
You can never step into the Palace
and the Prince Jun’s Mansion again.

172
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,670
Come on.

173
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,000
Father!

174
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,150
Drive Long Aoyi out of the Palace!

175
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,790
Long, wait for me outside the Palace.

176
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,480
Go!

177
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,150
Your Majesty.

178
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,680
It was a one-time lapse for Prince Jun.

179
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,400
If he gets married as soon as possible,
he will take his heart back.

180
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,030
You do have a point.

181
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,560
Prime Minister,
I’ll leave this matter to you.

182
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,870
Father.

183
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,750
I have promised Long.

184
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,000
I will only be with her this life.

185
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,790
Please take back your order.

186
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,750
The Tang royal family

187
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,000
will never allow you to marry

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,320
someone who broke the law
and deceived the Emperor.

189
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,600
Not to mention

190
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,550
she is not worthy of you.

191
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,910
Father.

192
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
I used to believe

193
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,720
birds of a feather flock together.

194
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,320
So it’s understandable

195
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,840
to have a suitable marriage.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,440
But that’s because I wasn’t in love.

197
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
After I fell in love,

198
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,150
I found that

199
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,080
all the worldly standards don’t matter.

200
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,670
You said she is not good enough for me.

201
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,750
But I think

202
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,480
maybe I don’t deserve her.

203
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,720
I think you are bewitched by her!

204
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,840
You are my son,

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,840
a dignified prince,

206
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,320
how can you say you don’t deserve

207
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,960
an orphan from the lower class!

208
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Since you said your son

209
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,480
can’t marry someone form the lower class,

210
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,600
then I am willing to

211
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,510
leave the royal family.

212
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,370
I won’t be the prince!

213
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,720
How dare you!

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,480
I order you to

215
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,040
stay at Prince Jun’s Mansion

216
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,540
before your wedding!

217
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,630
Father.

218
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,510
I won’t accept this marriage.

219
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,750
How unfilial you are!

220
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,910
How unfilial you are!

221
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,550
Calm down, Your Majesty.

222
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,030
Father!

223
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,270
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

224
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,200
His Majesty passed out!
Summon the physician!

= Seal of Chang’an Government =

226
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Officer, how long are you going to
close down our store?

227
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
How do I know that?

228
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,410
I’m just following the order.

229
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,050
Long Aoyi deceived His Majesty,

230
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,340
her bushiness must be dirty.

231
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,220
We have to investigate it before it runs.

232
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,930
Then go to investigate it!

233
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,410
Why do you just put a seal on the door?

234
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:40,980
Go away.

235
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,930
Ask my boss if you have any problem.

236
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,440
Officer! Officer!

Where’s the Master?

240
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,260
Isn’t she here?

241
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,200
No.

242
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,650
Our store is closed down.

243
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,690
We are all waiting for the Master
to make the order.

244
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,740
What should we do?

245
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,530
I don’t know where she is.

You made a good choice.

248
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,320
This is the best material.

249
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,830
Look at its color, isn’t it beautiful?

250
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,230
Move yourselves.

251
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,920
Madam,

252
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,950
how much is this cloth?

253
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,160
We are almost closed.

254
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,110
Just give me twenty pennies.

255
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,240
Twenty pennies? That expensive?

256
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,480
Let me see if

257
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,030
the cloth is big enough.

258
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,200
I think this color is very beautiful.

259
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,230
Yes, it’s suitable for you.

260
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,470
I want to buy this one, how do you think?

261
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,950
This pink one is also very beautiful.

262
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,020
Right?

263
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,800
Believe me.

264
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,630
Why do you

265
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,000
keep walking in front of me?

266
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,680
Let me have some luck

267
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,710
from your blessed belly.

268
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,870
Miss, look at this one.

269
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,250
I like it!

270
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,670
You have to dress as a eunuch.

271
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,670
How can there be such a
good-looking eunuch?

= Divorce Letter =
We are destined to

273
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,600
get married.

274
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,440
But time turns a couple into enemies.

275
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,390
First we blame and scold each other,

276
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,750
then we loathe each other.

277
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,760
If we hate each other,
we would be like wolf and sheep.

278
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,460
We should be separated

279
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,830
and go to find our own happiness.

280
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,000
The old woman is crazy.

May you long live forever.

282

Be careful. There is an ambush.

283
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,730
There is a hidden meaning in it.

What else are you going to say?

291
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,630
Didn’t I just tell you

292
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,840
Miss Long was kicked out!

293
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,270
I’m going to ask Prince Jun

294
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,600
if it’s true!

295
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,200
Yes.

296
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,440
Here is the imperial decree!

297
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,360
By the grace of god,

298
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,670
His Majesty orders Li Qingliu

299
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,360
to marry the daughter of
the Minister of War, Du Xiaoxian,

three days later.

301
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
Respect this.

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,720
What?

303
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,320
Prince Jun? Prince Jun?

304
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
I’ll accept the decree.

305
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,910
Prince Jun, doesn’t worry about the time.

306
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,720
The Ministry of Rites will
fully supervise this matter.

307
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,440
Prime Minister specially reminds you that

308
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,550
His Majesty gave you another verbal order

309
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,630
before he passed out.

310
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,870
Prince Jun mustn’t leave your mansion

311
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,910
before the wedding.

312
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,320
Thanks for reminding me.

313
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,550
Prime Minister, if we don’t
get rid of these two people,

314
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,390
it would really be a problem.

315
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,360
You have grown fangs, right?

316
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,680
I told you

317
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,810
when Long Aoyi came to Chang’an.

318
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,360
No one can touch her

319
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,580
before I get the Water Transport.

320
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,480
Do you want to use this chance

321
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,360
to kill her for your daughter?

322
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,240
I dare not. Please forgive me.

323
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,550
All the people of the Du family

324
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,550
are at your disposal.

325
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,240
It’s just

326
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,360
I am still in shock about

327
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,270
what happened to Concubine De.

328
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,120
I can’t sleep at night.

329
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,870
I’m really scared that

330
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,750
they will find us one day.

331

- Making Concubine De die
- Well...

332
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,510
is to let her bear all our sins.

333
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,960
Yes.

334
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,000
Thank you for saving my life.

335
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,440
What should we do next?

336
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,840
His Majesty is too soft-hearted.

337
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,670
They just talked him into
letting Long Aoyi go.

338
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,840
But it doesn’t matter.

339
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
I have my own way.

340
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,120
When I still have this person

341
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,840
in my hand,

342
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,080
I don’t believe the rest of them

343
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,510
won’t handle themselves over.

344
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,480
Well...

345
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,320
What if His Majesty knows about it?

346
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,440
The Emperor’s body gets worse every day.

347
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,120
It’s time to welcome the newcomer.

348
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,120
Is His Majesty’s sickness...

349
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,790
We have tried our best.

350
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,750
But

351
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,510
His Majesty is still in coma.

352
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,160
Now we use needles to
keep His Majesty’s vitality.

353
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,550
He would be fine

354
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,000
if we don’t move him around.

355
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,310
But Prime Minister,

356
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,960
you need to discuss with the courtiers.

357
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,000
I am afraid

358
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,240
the Crown Prince will need to govern
the nation on behalf of His Majesty.

359
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,200
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =
They said the Emperor Cheng of Han

360
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,310
only loves Concubine Ban.
They were inseparable.

361
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,720
But it didn’t last long.

362
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,790
Since the Zhao sisters entered the palace,

363
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,270
the Emperor Cheng of Han
just kicked her away.

364
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,830
That’s how

365
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,680
ruthless

366
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,160
the royal family is.

367
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,170
Right!

368
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,200
Who can understand

369
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,160
your vague innuendo?

370
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,960
I’ll be here to curse him

371
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,680
for three days and three nights!

372
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,630
Bah!

373
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,830
What are you yelling for?

374
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,750
If you yell again, I’ll throw you in jail!

375
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
Do it!

376
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,370
Go ahead!

377
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,820
Throw us all in jail!

378
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,270
Master.

379
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,750
Those people outside the door

380
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,200
are noisy like flies.

381
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,240
We weren't able to drive them away.

382
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,330
Do it!

383
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,030
You can leave.

384
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,960
Yes.

385
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,790
Master.

386
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,440
Let me drive them away.

387
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,440
No need.

388
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,830
They will leave when they are tired.

389
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,690
Are we afraid of you?

390
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,240
Go ahead! Come out!

391
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,110
We are not afraid of you!

392
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Not only they don’t understand,

393
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,510
even I can’t understand

394
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,880
why you agreed to the marriage.

395
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,030
Why don’t you chase Lady Long back?

396
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,110
The imperial edict is hard to violate,

397
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,960
but you...

398
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,550
You do know that the imperial edict
is hard to violate.

399
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,510
I am not afraid to
fight against the whole court,

400
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
But...

401
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,790
But what?

402
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,590
Nothing.

403
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Miss, you have been
embroidering it the whole day.

404
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,240
Take a break and eat something.

405
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,720
His Majesty’s decree

406
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,350
advanced the wedding earlier.

407
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,070
I need to embroider
Qingliu’s wedding clothes.

408
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,160
The wedding clothes
need to be embroidered.

409
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,640
But you also need to be healthy.

410
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,200
Otherwise, how can you have strength

411
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,200
to spend the wedding night
with Prince Jun?

412
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,240
Shameful.

413
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,440
Anyway,

414
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,350
Long Aoyi was finally kicked out.

415
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,240
You will be Princess Jun

416
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,480
by then.

417
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,920
Thinking about it makes me feel happy.

418
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,480
Yeah.

419
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,270
From Silver City to Chang’an,

420
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,070
she is like a thorn in my throat.

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,440
Now it’s finally pulled out.

422
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,590
All right.

423
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,920
I’m going to embroider it.

424
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,540
= Jun =

425
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,310
Qingliu.

426
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,960
I’ve embroidered your wedding clothes.

427
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,720
The Ministry of Rites
doesn’t need to prepare it.

428
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,480
Take a look, do you like it?

429
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,830
Well,

430
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,400
are you worried about my design?

431
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,590
Xiaoxian.

432
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,350
Are you really going to marry me?

433
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,270
Didn’t you know my heart

434
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,110
a long time ago?

435
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,320
You should find someone

436
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,110
who really loves you.

437
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,910
Love?

438
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,350
I stopped yearning it long time ago.

439
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,110
I only need an identity now.

440
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,270
Xiaoxian.

441
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,240
I have nothing to give you.

442
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,270
Yue’er.

443
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Put down the clothes.

444
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,160
Let’s go.

445
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,310
This hairpin is so delicate.

446
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,710
Miss, look.

447
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,920
Go out.

448
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,780
Go out.

449
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,640

you don’t want to marry Li Qingliu now?

475
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,460
Don’t want?

476
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,950
How can I not want it?

477
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,440
I’ve been looking forward to this day

478
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,310
since I was fifteen.

479
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,750
I won’t give up at this critical moment.

480
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,550
Good.

481
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,550
This is my good daughter.

482
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,550
Come on.

483
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,710
Let me help you up.

484
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,920
You do look like your mother.

485
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,200
With such a beautiful face,

486
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,310
you are destined to marry
the Prince of Tang.

487
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,270
Take this bottle of

488
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,510
Yuzhu powder.

489
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,440
This is...

490
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,120
His Majesty is ill now.

491
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,030
If he dies suddenly,

492
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,470
the Crown Prince will inherit Tang

493
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,600
and ascend to the throne.

494
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,790
If the Crown Prince dies unexpectedly,

495
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,710
Prime Minister will plead His Majesty

496
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,080
to select a new crown prince.

497
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,360
Father, you mean

498
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,840
if the Crown Prince dies,

499
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,840
Prime Minister will help Qingliu
become the Crown Prince?

500
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,750
After you marry Prince Jun,

501
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,120
we will be on the same boat.

502
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,270
But you are

503
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,310
murdering the Crown Prince.

504
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,840
Of course I know it.

505
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,790
It’s not a small matter.

506
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,160
But for your happiness,

507
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,880
also for my lifelong wish,

508
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,950
I have to take a risk.

509
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,710
By then

510
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,030
someone will

511
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,030
put the poison into Crown Prince’s tea.

512
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,270
But if anything goes wrong,

513
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,470
you need to find a chance

514
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,400
and spread this powder on
the teacup of the Crown Prince.

515
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,160
If you do that,

516
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,880
we will definitely succeed.

517
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,270
Okay.

518
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,200
Prime Minister, you played a good game.

519
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
I’m afraid you have planned

520
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
the next ten steps before you make a move.

521
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,030
I feel so inadequate.

522
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,310
You’ve been by my side for so long.

523
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,470
You should know plotting
a strategy is the key to win.

524
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,470
And it has to be done early,

525
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,840
not one step late.

526
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
I’m ashamed.

527
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,120
I lost Long Aoyi.

528
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,750
As long as Prince Jun is still in my game,

529
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Long Aoyi won’t escape.

530
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,020
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

531
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,170
Greetings to the Consort Dowager,
the Crown Prince,

532
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,540
and Princess Shengping.

533
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,630
You may rise.

534
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,170
Where is the wedding hall?

535
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,780
Take me there.

536
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,690
This way, please.

537
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,210
Miss, Prince Jun is...

538
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,320
Miss.

539
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,260
Prince Jun is about to be here.

540
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,690
Put the veil on me.

541
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,540
= Wedding =

542
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,920
Give it to me!

543
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,440
This way!

544
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:40,760
Give it to me!

545
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,140
It’s mine!

546
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,170
All right.

547
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,340
I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!

548
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,540
Hurry up, come with me.

549
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,370
Hold on.

550
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Who are you?

551
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,210
We are here to congratulate Prince Jun.

552
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,610
No one told me that.

553
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,300
This is a surprise
specially arranged by Prime Minister.

554
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,020
I dare not tell other people.

555
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,340
What’s in the box?

556
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:08,890
General.

557
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,610
I’m afraid you can’t bear the result

558
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,670
if the wedding gets delayed.

559
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,580
The seal of Prime Minister.

560
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,210
Exactly.

561
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,020
Let them go.

562
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,500
Thank you.

563
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,740
Everyone.

564
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,060
Find a place to hide.

565
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,020
Act according to plan.

566
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,360
Yes.

567
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,650
Wait for my news.

568
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:41,890
Yes.

569
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,540
= Wedding =

570
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,820
Today is the wedding of Qingliu.

571
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,450
It should be a happy event,

572
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,170
since our father is ill,

573
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,210
I’ll do the mantras

574
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,370
to pray for blessing.

575
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,210
On this auspicious day,

576
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,740
our Qingliu and Du Xiaoxian
are getting married.

577
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,650
May they long live

578
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,980
and be healthy.

579
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,170
May they have many children
and be wealthy.

580
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,260
May the husband always be a high official.

581
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,650
May the wife always live a noble life.

582
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,020
May this couple

583
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,890
live long after the praying.

584
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,890
You can perform the ritual.

585
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,020
First, bow to heaven and earth.

586
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,540
Second, bow to your elders.

587
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:16,980
Qingliu.

588
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,060
Qingliu!

589
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,580
Qingliu!

590
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,540
Second, bow to your elders.

591
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,610
You may rise.

592
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,580

This first cup of tea

611
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,000
should have offered to Father.

612
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,600
But our father is ill.

613
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,380
The eldest brother is like the father.

614
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,380
So the Crown Prince

615
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
will accept the tea on behalf of Father.

616
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,760
Happy dumpling!

617
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,900
Go find someone with a veil.

618
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,500
I have a bad feeling.

619
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:29,690
Yes.

620
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,100
Servant,

621
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,690
give Prince Jun another cup of tea.

622
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,900
Prime Minister?

623
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,170
Why aren’t you at the wedding?

624
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,580
What are you doing in my room?

625
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,380
Lady.

626
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,500
Now I should call you

627
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,810
Master Long.

628
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,900
Your old lover is performing
wedding ritual in the front hall.

629
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,100
And you are sitting here alone.

630
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,650
Don’t you feel a little upset?

631
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,540
You said he was an old lover.

632
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,060
Besides, our marriage is fake.

633
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,250
The fake can’t become real.

634
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,460
The truth won’t be covered forever.

635
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,650
I heard Master Long

636
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,640
acquired lobbying strategy

637
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,420
from a famous teacher in Silver City.

638
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,020
You do learn a lot from your master.

639
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,980
When you sit down,
you start to observe me.

640
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,940
Aren’t you also observing me?

641
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,130
I don’t need to do that.

642
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,690
How is that?

643
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,540
Because you are not
good enough to be my opponent.

644
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,210
Then why do you

645
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,690
keep rubbing your fingers?

646
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,690
Don’t you know

647
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,770
doing that means

648
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,690
you have something on your mind?

649
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,730
I do have something to say.

650
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,020
I heard you

651
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,880
still can’t let go of

652
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,810
your master’s death.

653
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,840
Do you want to know how your master died?

654
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,330
She died in my arms being wounded.

655
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,130
That scene and her look come to my mind

656
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,290
when I’m awake and when I have a dream.

657
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,130
I can’t forget it even I want to.

658
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,210
She didn’t have to die.

659
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,940
When your master was young,

660
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,460
she kept moving around
and no one knew where she is.

661
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,610
But she stayed in Silver City

662
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
for more than ten years.

663
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,330
That’s because she

664
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,730
picked up an orphan in Silver City.

665
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,020
She hoped she can

666
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,460
raise up the orphan.

667
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,940
But she didn’t expect that

668
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,460
she died because of

669
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,330
the orphan.

670
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,610
Nonsense! It’s you!

671
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,080
I have been looking for her.

672
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,650
But she had been

673
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,330
laying low. It was hard to find her.

674
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,140
As a result,

675
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,810
I noticed you when I was
looking for the prince
