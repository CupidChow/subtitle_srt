32
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,620
Take a coin.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,860
You and I each pick one side.

34
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,660
Drop the coin vertically into the water.

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,980
The person whose side faces up

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
when the coin falls

That’s fair.

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,860
Step aside.

39
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,540
May I ask this is...

40
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,740
Master of Longzhu Gang, Long Aoyi.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,900
Right now I am the
personal maid of Master Li.

42
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,300
My job is sweeping the floor.

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,500
Sorry for making you laugh.

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,180
Interesting.

45
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,740
They have a study partner.

46
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,940
Master Li has a gambling partner.

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,260
That’s all right.

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,740
Pick your side and make a bet.

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,220
There are no rules for
this kind of gamble.

50
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,380
You can’t cheat either.

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,620
How much do you want to bet?

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,220
I don’t need you here. Go back.

53
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,460
Gamble without me,
do you have confidence to win?

54
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,740
Do you?

55
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,860
Make the biggest bet

56
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,260
you can afford

57
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,580
to scare Mr. Shen away.

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,580
Only in this way can you get what you want

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,820
without actual winning or losing.

60
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,580
Let’s be decisive.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,340
How much?

62
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,260
The biggest.

63
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,260
To show my sincerity,

64
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,740
I’ll bet the deed of my Silk Manor.

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,530
Well...

66
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,220
Yan Bin.

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,810
The deed?

68
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,780
= Deed =

69
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,400
That’s a big bet.

70
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,380
- That’s too much.
- Deed...

71
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,840
Look.

72
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,260
Bet once and bet the biggest.

73
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,300
Master Li is generous indeed.

74
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,420
I like it.

75
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,780
But

76
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,860
I didn’t bring

77
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,620
anything valuing that much.

78
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,260
How about

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,100
I write down my deed in Jiangnan

80
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,380
as my bet?

81
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,700
You mustn’t do that.

82
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,940
Your deed in Jiangnan

83
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,580
is more valuable than mine in Silver City.

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Then I’ll raise you one-year selling right

85
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,820
of my three stores in Silver City.

86
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,380
Well...

87
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,780
- How do you want to raise?
- One-year selling right...

88
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,100
Well...

89
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,500
Well...

90
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,660
I...

91
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,980
I’ll have to bet my

92
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,340
Silk Store in Jiangnan.

93
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Mr. Shen.

94
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,380
You mustn’t do that.

95
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,220
This old man can’t take

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,540
such a fierce bet from Li Qingliu.

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,980
With one more straw,

98
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,700
he will crack.

99
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,700
You two must think it through.

100
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,940
Once the coin falls into the water,

101
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,780
the loser

102
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,940
will lose all his property.

103
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,300
Are you sure about that?

104
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,660
We bet on the head side.

105
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
Place your bet.

106
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,460
Sir, you can drop the coin anytime.

107
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,620
Stop!

108
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,700
You have shown me

109
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,260
your sincerity.

110
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,300
I’ll take you as my friend.

111
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,740
As for the contract,

112
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,820
we can sign it later.

113
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,980
About this gamble...

114
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,700
Just forget it.

115
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,940
That’s not having fun.

116
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,380
This is risking life.

117
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,700
You are making fun of me.

118
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,180
Wait!

119
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,700
Send Master Long back

120
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,780
with my sedan chair.

121
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,140
Never mind.

122
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,020
A bullock cart is better
than a sedan chair.

123
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,860
I can’t ride a horse.

124
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,060
The Cui Yingying played by Gengzi

125
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,380
= Dock =
is really like our master.

126
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,780
They are basically the same person.

127
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,660
Gengzi, we are talking about you.

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,380
In the Yingying Liuyao yesterday,

129
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,660
you played two roles.

130
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,540
Goodness!

131
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,340
Go away.

132
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,460
You are a big mouth.

133
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,100
The Cui Yingying you played

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,380
is really like our master.

135
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,340
Do you have a crush on her?

136
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,100
Bring me the soil cutter.

137
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,620
- Shave his lanugo!
- Come on...

138
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,980
Shave his hair!

139
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,580
Do it, don’t just talk about it!

140
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,380
Master!

141
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,020
Master is here.

142
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,870
Master!

143
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,220
Greetings to Master!

144
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,500
Thank you for tiding Silk Manor over.

145
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,820
I’ll drink three bowls of liquor.

146
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,580
Master.

147
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,100
Master drinks like a fish!

148
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,460
Bravo!

149
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,020
I will still be busy for some time.

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,780
You know the drill.

151
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,700
If anything happens,
just go to Second Master Lyu.

152
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
If you have to see me,

153
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,900
you can go to Xiaoqin
and wait for your turn.

154
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,820
Yes, Master!

155
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,860
Yes, Master!

156
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,340
Master, what are you busy with?

157
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,620
Master, please ascend to the seat.

158
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,140
Master, please ascend to the seat.

159
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,860
Master, please ascend to the seat.

160
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,700
Please.

161
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,220
Everyone, please have a seat.

162
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,420
We need to follow the rules.
But we can also change the rules.

163
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,860
Since you chose to follow me,

164
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,420
you have to stick to my rules.

165
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,980
Inform other brothers in the gang

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,780
that from tomorrow,

167
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,420
the oblong table discussion
of the twelve districts of Longzhu Gang

168
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,300
will be changed to
square table discussion.

169
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,780
On the square table,

170
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,860
there is no chairman, no status.

171
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,620
We welcome equal discussion.

172
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,740
Everyone can speak up freely.

173
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,220
I’ll sit here today.

174
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,220
Chef, serve the main dishes!

175
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,060
Everyone, it’s time to eat!

176
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,500
Let’s eat!

177
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,980
Thank you, Master!

178
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,860
- Thank you, Master!
- Pour the liquor.

179
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,220
Come on.

180
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,460
- In terms of beauty and decisiveness,
- Fill the cup.

181
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,300
Master is ten times better

182
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,060
than Cui Yingying!

183
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,140
Of course!

184
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,200
Come on.

185
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,940
To Master.

186
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,700
Come on, you guys.

187
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,200
Let’s drink!

188
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,500
To Master!

189
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,140
Be careful.

190
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,420
You can move it away.

191
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,340
Shuisheng.

192
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,580
Move this away, too.

193
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,620
Were you scolded again?

194
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
No, sister.

195
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,020
Today I should withdraw

196
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,420
the wages previously deposited.

197
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,260
Deduction of wages?

198
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,420
No, sister.

199
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,060
We have an internal bank

200
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,460
where we can deposit

201
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
our spare wages.

202
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,980
The interest is 30% of the principal.

203
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,900
30%?

204
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,460
You can get three pennies
with ten pennies,

205
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,780
thirty pennies with one hundred pennies.

206
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,340
A tael of silver...

207
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,460
But it’s only open for

208
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
internal stuff

209
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,380
to retain workers

210
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,980
who might be lured elsewhere.

211
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,700
No wonder

212
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,300
he always acts like a dork.

213
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,140
It turns out that
he puts all his efforts on this.

214
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,540
Chubby. Stop chatting, come to work.

215
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,420
Hurry up.

216
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,820
Coming.

217
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,060
Master.

218
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,900
Let me ask you one more time.

219
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,740
This is all the money

220
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,860
of Longzhu Gang.

221
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,300
Master, is it really reliable?

222
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,100
Rest assured.

223
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,420
Li Qingliu is a vicious man,

224
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,380
but I have to admit

225
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,460
he is something in business.

226
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,500
Perhaps we should learn from him

227
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,900
about how to make money.

228
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Have you changed it into bank note?

229
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,140
It’s a total of
fifty-three thousand taels.

230
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:13,980
Master.

231
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,420
Aren’t we

232
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,140
looting a burning house?

233
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,580
There is no better time

234
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,580
to extort money

235
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,700
from Li Qingliu.

236
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,140
Xiaoqin.

237
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,140
Listen, I did the math.

238
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,740
With that interest,

239
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,860
we will have the money

240
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,700
to start a small business

241
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,940
three months later.

242
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,300
Half a year later,

243
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,380
we can buy each brother

244
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,500
an acre of land.

245
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Maybe a few more years later,

246
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,620
I can buy the Silk Manor

247
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,100
and make Li Qingliu

248
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,420
become my prisoner.

249
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,820
I’ll let him serve tea for me.

250
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,180
No.

251
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,740
I’ll let him bring me water
to wash my feet.

252
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,180
These are

253
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,560
semi-finished products

254
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,820
because of the lack of accessories

255
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,660
like flower embroidery, beading

256
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,060
and leather edging.

257
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,180
Everyone, hurry up about it.

258
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,140
Hope we can sell them early.

259
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,540
Chubby.

260
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,540
How’s your relationship with me?

261
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,700
But in case...

262
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,220
If I lose the money,

263
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,140
I’ll accept the result.

264
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,980
I won’t blame you.

265
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,060
Okay.

266
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,700
I know you won’t reject me.

267
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,660
Master.

268
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,220
You are slacking again.

269
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,780
Come with me.

270
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,860
Is this the box for gold thread?

271
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,780
It’s too small.

272
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,260
How much can it take?

273
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,660
A strand of gold thread

274
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,500
is as thin as a hair.

275
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,820
But the price is

276
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,460
twenty times higher
than the pure gold of the same amount.

277
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,740
The box is intact.

278
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,820
The brass lock is not broken.

279
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,700
But the stuff inside is gone.

280
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
I guess

281
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,180
someone copied the key

282
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,100
and unlocked the box.

283
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,420
But I always feel

284
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,940
there is something being overlooked.

285
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,460
That’s why

286
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,140
we haven’t found any clues.

287
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,380
Don’t underestimate
the skill of unlocking.

288
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,780
It has different schools.

289
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,220
You mean

290
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
there is a secret technique

291
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,660
that ordinary people don’t know?

292
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,580
So are you

293
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,220
begging me?

294
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,140
You tore off my post

295
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,100
but made no progress so far.

296
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,860
With your efficiency,

297
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,180
you would have been

298
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,780
kicked out long ago.

299
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,940
I think of someone.

300
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,900
Mr. Tan. Mr. Tan!

301
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,900
Mr. Tan!

302
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,420
= Toad Brew =
Toad brew of five years.

303
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,260
I was wondering who it is.

304
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,740
You are a master now,

305
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,660
you must’ve forgotten your
drinking buddy long ago.

306
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,620
Sorry, Mr. Tan.

307
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,460
The former master abdicated,
leaving too many affairs for me.

308
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,740
Today I am here

309
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,850
to pay my filial duties.

310
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,620
Go ahead.

311
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,260
What’s bothering you?

312
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,420
I can’t hide anything from you,

313
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,220
Mr. Tan.

314
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,260
The toad brew

315
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,740
is your stingy master’s favorite.

316
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,700
I asked her for it several times,
but she wouldn’t give it to me.

317
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
Why is she so generous this time?

318
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,620
A word, please.

319
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,980
An inch of rosewood with an inch of gold.

320
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,260
Boy, this is a treasure.

321
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,000
Don’t miss the point.

322
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,390
Look at the lock on it.

323
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,000
Little girl.

324
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,920
Who is this fine-skinned boy?

325
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,080
I’m Li Qingliu from Xinsilu.

326
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,520
Sounds like a girl’s name.

327
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,880
I mean, little girl,

328
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,520
you two should change your names.

329
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,480
I’m just saying it.

330
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Don’t take it personally.

331
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,600
The name is like the lock.

332
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,440
Also like a young bird,

333
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,040
once you open it,

334
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,480
the sound would be different.

335
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,880
Interesting.

336
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,480
Interesting.

337
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,880
But this lock

338
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,280
has been opened only once.

339
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,300
- What?
- What?

340
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,740
When Li Jun’er opened it,

341
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,820
it was the first time.

342
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,220
How is that possible?

343
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,220
Well, look.

344
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,100
There is no nail in this box.

345
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,340
It’s well sealed.

346
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,220
Someone used some skill

347
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,380
to rotate in the middle

348
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,940
and opened it without

349
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,900
picking or unlocking the lock.

350
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,380
Then he took it out and closed the box.

351
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,820
You mean

352
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,940
the stuff inside can be taken out

353
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,380
without unlocking the lock?

354
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,340
Do you know who masters this skill?

355
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,780
It comes from Lingnan

356
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,900
and remains a secret.

357
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,780
Even I

358
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,860
don’t know the trick.

359
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,100
Do you know

360
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,180
where I can find the carpenter in Lingnan?

361
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,500
I’ve never seen that person before.

362
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,300
This skill

363
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,820
is all about mastering your fingertip.

364
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,340
It is said if one practices it
for a long time,

365
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,260
the finger will bend
like a crouching tiger.

366
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
I knew you wouldn’t let me down!

367
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,140
Sir.

368
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,660
This is five hundred taels.

369
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,100
If we find the gold thread,

370
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,380
I will pay good money to you.

371
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,740
Little girl.

372
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,860
You picked an eligible boyfriend!

373
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,220
No.

374
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,180
Tell him

375
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,700
I won’t take the money.

376
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,420
But if you

377
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,860
get married someday, don’t forget to

378
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,500
prepare a large jar

379
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,460
of toad brew for me!

380
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,260
You are doing it again.

381
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,220
Don’t match me up

382
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,780
with any random guy.

383
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,500
Well, haven’t you taken him down yet?

384
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,300
Let me teach you one trick.

385
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,580
As long as you two sleep in one bed,

386
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,780
even the enemy

387
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,500
would become family.

388
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,180
I said it’s not like that.

389
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,060
I feel sleepy again.

390
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,660
I’m sleepy!

391
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,980
Who is any random guy?

392
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,920
Hurry up.

393
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,300
Serve the good stuff!

394
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,700
There is a chicken
in the belly of the sheep.

395
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,540
Is this

396
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,940
the stuffed mutton of legend?

397
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,420
But at this time,

398
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,140
Master Li is...

399
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,900
Don’t worry. I checked it.

400
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Li Qingliu and Yan Bin

401
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,260
won’t come here at this time.

402
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Thank you for your care

403
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,780
during these days.

404
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,700
I am a person who

405
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,500
would share my wealth

406
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,660
with my friends.

407
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,180
Please enjoy the dinner
of liquor and meat tonight.

408
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,540
Thank you!

409
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,280
Level and vertical, stick to the rules.

410
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,460
Level and vertical, stick to the rules!

411
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:07,820
Come on!

412
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,940
Let’s make a circle.

413
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,020
Come here.

414
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,940
- Come on.
- Come on.

415
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,230
Hold hands.

416
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,220
Tonight,

417
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,300
I’ll teach you a dance of Guo Manor.

418
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,700
When we danced at Guo Manor,

419
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,100
we would hold hands

420
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,620
and interlock the fingers.

421
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,340
Come on.

422
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,140
Let’s go round!

423
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,900
Let’s go round! Come on!

424
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,170
Come on.

425
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,140
That’s interesting.

426
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,180
They can touch hands in public this way.

427
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,980
Go round!

428
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,660
What’s wrong, Master Long?

429
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,020
- But...
- It’s okay.

430
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,980
If we go up there and touch their hands,

431
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,340
we can see it more clearly.

432
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,860
When we danced at Guo Manor,

433
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,140
if I were a man,

434
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,540
and I had a crush on a girl,

435
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,660
I would pick her palm like this.

436
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,180
If she agreed,

437
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,620
she would pick my palm back.

438
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,020
But if she rejected me,

439
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,580
it wouldn’t be awkward
because she didn’t know it.

440
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,100
Go to Chubby. Hurry up!

441
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,220
That’s kind of interesting.

442
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,150
Come on.

443
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,020
Pick palm...

444
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,220
Master.

445
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:30,700
Come on.

446
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,980
Next time you...

447
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,540
It’s not the time for joke.

448
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,940
Watch their hands.

449
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,300
Let’s go round!

450
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,660
Yes.

451
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,290
Come over.

452
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,540
No one has bent finger. One, two, three.

453
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,180
No, there’s one missing.

454
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,780
Where is Dongzi?

455
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,420
He said he would come later.

456
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,580
He had a run and went to the latrine.

457
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,660
Go on.

458
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,930
Come on.

459
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,530
Come on!

460
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,660
He’s is not here?

461
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,340
It was an excuse. Let’s go.

462
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,660
= Righteous Spirit =
Silk Manor’s Dongzi disappeared last night.

463
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,740
We can’t get in touch with him.

464
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,660
Well...

465
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,700
Can’t get in touch with our undercover?

466
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,700
I don’t believe it!

467
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,300
On one can make trouble
for us in Silver City!

468
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,320
Master Qiyan, if we can’t reach him,

469
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,240
why don’t we just give him up?

470
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,250
Are you stupid?

471
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,070
He has the gold thread.
If we can’t reach him,

472
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,260
our efforts would be wasted!

473
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,330
Give him up?

474
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
He can pierce through the sky
with his mouth!

475
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,880
Listen,

476
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
if anything goes wrong
with the gold thread,

477
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,480
I will use you to fix the hole!

478
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,660
Dongzi stayed out all night.

479
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,180
Seems that there is something wrong.

480
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,780
Does he live alone in this single room?

481
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,460
Yes.

482
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,500
The supervisors from other cities
all live in a single room.

483
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,280
He is too poor.

484
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,840
He only has a pair of ragged socks.

485
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
Do you deduct wages?

486
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,040
Dongzi is in charge of
the accounts of shipment.

487
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,040
His salary is higher than others.

488
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,600
What is going on then?

489
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,960
Did he use all the money

490
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,040
to drink and please girls?

491
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,080
That’s impossible.

492
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,420
I never saw him

493
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
in Wuyun Pavilion before.

494
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,920
The bed is a mess.

495
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
But strangely, it is cleaner than others.

496
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,560
What are you doing?

497
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
There must be a trick about the bed.

498
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,600
Lie here, too.

499
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,400
Why?

500
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,360
Here is a clue. Believe me. Come on.

501
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,600
Rest assured.

502
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,200
I won’t sleep with you even
I want to have an eligible boyfriend.

503
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,880
I would rather sleep with Xiaozhao.

504
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,680
Xiaozhao…

505
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,440
Hurry up.

506
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,480
Come on.

507
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,320
What’s going on?

508
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,520
Don’t look.

509
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,520
Don’t look. Don’t look!

510
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,620
Go away. Go away!

511
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,520
Get up!

512
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,160
It is a smoke screen.

513
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,800
What is this?

514
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
The name of a black gold shop
in the Southern City.

515
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,920
Black gold shop.

516
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
There should be a name tag.

517
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,560
Where is the name tag?

518
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,880
Looks like he deposited the money

519
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,840
at that place.

520
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,840
He didn’t deposit the money at our bank.

521
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,880
He had to went through the trouble
and went somewhere else.

522
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,760
No, it’s not like that.

523
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,600
This black gold shop

524
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,680
is not like other banks

525
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,840
or pawnshops.

526
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,640
Not a ray of sunshine
in the broad daylight

527
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
or a drop of rain can get into that place.

528
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,200
It’s not hot in summer without using ice.

529
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,520
It’s neither cold in a snowy day
without setting fire.

530
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,840
It’s amazing,

531
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
just like Arcadia.

532
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:31,920
You mean

533
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,720
it’s warm in winter and cool in summer,

534
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
with constant temperature in four seasons?

535
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
That sounds right.

536
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,000
The spring is coming,

537
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,040
the gold thread is pure.

538
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,120
If you don’t weave it or dye it in time,

539
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,240
it would be oxidized rapidly by heat.

540
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,280
Unless you...

541
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
Keep it under thermostatic preservation!

542
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
I see.

543
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,240
Working with guys like you

544
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,680
is like working by myself.

545
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,920
If anything happens,

546
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,360
I have to take care of it all by myself.

547
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,920
All by myself.

548
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,560
Wonderful.

549
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,680
How did you feel, sir?

550
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
Why didn’t you bring Yan Bin out today?

551
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,880
It would attract unnecessary attention

552
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
with too many people.

553
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,880
Who will pay attention to you?

554
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,320
What about your maid?

555
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,360
Xiaoqin is my sister.

556
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,280
You might as well ask Yan Bin

557
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
instead of asking me.

558
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,120
What do you mean?

559
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,520
Yan Bin grew up with me since childhood.

560
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,640
His taste

561
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,320
won’t be that bad.

562
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,520
What do you mean by that?

563
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
My Xiaoqin doesn’t deserve that fool?

564
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
Watch your words.

565
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,360
Your words are not that nice, either.

566
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,760
The girls of Longzhu Gang

567
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,800
are reckless and know no rules.

568
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,560
The three obediences and four virtues,
you have nothing.

569
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,560
Xiaoqin is not a good match for Yan Bin.

570
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,640
What is a good match?

571
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,200
You’re still thinking about

572
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,960
the eligible boyfriend
Mr. Tan talked about?

573
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,440
I told you

574
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,360
no one wants your Silk Manor,

575
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,560
and no one likes

576
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,720
you two idiots.

577
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,160
You...

578
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,680
I...

579
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,080
They’re just two idiots!

580
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,840
They never take me when they go out.

581
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,560
Why do you blame our girl?

582
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,360
Let’s drink.

583
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,840
Have a taste.

584
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,440
I remember one thing.

585
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,040
Today I saw

586
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,880
the two of them

587
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,400
doing that

588
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,080
in bed.

589
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,320
Doing what?

590
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,800
I don’t know. But I feel like

591
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,160
your Master Long

592
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,440
was seducing our master.

593
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,800
She seduced your master?

594
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,640
Are you blind?

595
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,630
Sit down.

596
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,280
Really.

597
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,720
But the problem is

598
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,280
our master can’t touch any girl.

599
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,390
It must be Master Long

600
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,360
who took the initiative.

601
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,680
Well...

602
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,480
How did she take the initiative?

603
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,500
Let me think.

604
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,340
It should be...

605
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,420
Like this.

606
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,140
Hey!

607
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,140
Do you know the way or not?

608
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,780
Do you think the entrance to the
black gold shop is that easy to find?

609
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,180
Go ahead if you can find it.

610
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
Here we are. The entrance.

611
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,260
Deposit or withdraw?

612
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,660
- Deposit.
- Withdraw.

613
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,420
Deposit or withdraw?

614
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,860
- Deposit.
- Withdraw.

615
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,860
Deposit or withdraw?

616
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,620
Withdraw.

617
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,500
Time, name and your card.

618
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,660
Deposit, we want to deposit.

619
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,340
Well, still in the old box.

620
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,780
Name.

621
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,820
Dongzi, D-O-N-G-Z-I.

622
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,060
There’s already a Dongzi inside.

623
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,420
Why is there another Dongzi?

624
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,700
This is a whole crate of pepper?

625
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,820
Forget about it. Let’s go.

626
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:42,940
Over there!

627
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
How did you get on the roof?

628
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,300
No time for talking. Chase him!

629
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,100
Dongzi, don’t run!

630
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,140
Don’t come over!

631
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Don’t force me.

632
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,100
You are all forcing me!

633
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,860
Have you ever thought about me?

634
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,780
Who forced you?

635
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,420
Give me the gold thread.

636
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,540
You won’t say it, I won’t say it,
he won’t say it.

637
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,460
No one would know it.

638
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,820
No one would do anything to you.

639
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,540
They won’t let me go.

640
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,060
I have no way out.

641
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,780
Dongzi, come down first.

642
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,620
Let’s talk.

643
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,220
Master, sorry!

644
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,420
It’s not that simple.

645
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,820
Otherwise I wouldn’t have

646
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,860
ended up like this.

647
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,340
I’m afraid. I’ve regretted!

648
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,100
I know you have your reason

649
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,020
to do that.

650
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,140
How much money do you need?

651
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,940
Come down first. I’ll give it to you.

652
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,260
You can pay me back later.

653
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,740
Don’t come over!

654
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,860
If you come over, I will...

655
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,660
I...

656
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,460
I’ll destroy all the gold thread!

657
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,780
Let’s talk.

658
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,140
Dongzi.

659
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,500
If you give me the gold thread,

660
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,700
I promise Li Qingliu and I

661
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,980
won’t do anything bad to you.

662
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,380
Or let’s die together!

663
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,060
Put me down! Dongzi is running away!

664
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,740
Dongzi!

665
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,780
He is dead.

666
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,820
Now Dongzi is dead,

667
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,980
we lost the clue of the gold thread again.

668
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,260
Gold thread.

669
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,660
It’s such an unlucky day.

670
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,460
I have to take this drunk home.

671
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,120
Pour me another drink.

672
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,350
I can still drink.

673
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,300
= Xinsilu =

674
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,900
Get up! Get up!

675
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,300
Hey!

676
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,900
= Xinsilu =
Is anyone there? Open the door!

677
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,940
Open the door!

678
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,420
Get up!

679
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,820
Is that you, Junjun?

680
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,660
Don’t leave me.

681
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,220
I missed you so much.

682
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,220
Hey!

683
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,580
Councilors.

684
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,860
Let me tell you something.

685
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,140
When I was poor,

686
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,180
I really liked an ancient sword.

687
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,260
Now I miss it very much.

688
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,020
Can you help me find it?

689
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,340
Isn’t that the story of Liu Xun and
the Empress Xu Pingjun?

690
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,540
Now I miss it very much.

691
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:45,220
Don’t leave me, Junjun.

692
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,340
This is my favorite story.

693
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,220
First it was Dachun, now it is Dongzi.

694
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,340
We’ve found the gold thread,

695
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,420
but those who are related to it all died.

696
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,940
If he needed money,

697
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,420
stealing the gold thread was too obvious.

698
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,780
Besides, there are so many

699
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,460
valuable things in the Silk Manor.

700
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
He wouldn’t be so stupid.

701
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,260
I’ve clearly drawn a line

702
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,300
and told you to stay away from me
at least for three feet.

703
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,860
You don’t listen to me
and pull rank on me.

704
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,420
= Xinsilu =

705
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,940
Actually, I have something else
to tell you.

706
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,660
I have a crush on you.

707
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,360
How is it possible?

708
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,000
I would have passed out in the past.

709
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,960
It’s not reasonable.

710
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,680
Master.

711
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,080
What’s wrong with you?

712
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,200
= Unforgettable Love =

713
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,280
Unforgettable...

714
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,840
Yan Bin.

715
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,320
Let me ask you something.

716
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,440
I have an old friend. Yesterday...

717
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,200
Old friend?

718
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,880
I don’t think you have other friends

719
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,800
but me.

720
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
I mean yesterday,

721
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,360
I saw a little girl in danger,

722
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,280
and I held her in my arms

723
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
under circumstances beyond control.

724
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,800
But...

725
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,600
I didn’t have the reaction I used to have.

726
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,320
Held her in your arms?

727
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,680
A little girl?

728
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,480
Well...

729
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,280
You didn’t have any reaction?

730
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,920
Isn’t that strange?

731
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,440
This is not that strange.

732
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,680
The small kids can’t tell the difference
between men and women.

733
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,760
Well...

734
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,320
What if she is older?

735
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,960
How old?

736
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,240
Like Nanny?

737
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,160
Younger.

738
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,040
Younger.

739
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,760
Well...

740
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,640
Younger,

741
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,240
just like Master Long.

742
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,720
What are you talking about?

743
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,840
Of marriageable age.

744
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,640
It’s the right time

745
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,680
to get married.

746
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,240
It means you have a crush on her.
