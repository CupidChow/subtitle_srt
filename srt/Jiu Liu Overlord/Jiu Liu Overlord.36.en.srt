Qingliu!

33
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,150
Are you alright?

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Qingliu!

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,430
Don’t scare me, Qingliu!

36
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,280
Qingliu!

37
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,030
I’m not dead yet.

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,130
Why are you so stubborn?

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
I told you to let go of me.

40
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,490
Without you,

41
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,710
what’s the point of living?

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,570
Wait.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,910
I still have the antidote,

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,590
but maybe it won’t work.

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,190
Try it and we’ll see.

46
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,910
I’m poisoned already.

47
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,840
If it worked, that’d be perfect.

48
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,360
If not,

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
I’ll battle poison with poison.

50
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,120
Don’t joke about your life.

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
I’d like to try my luck.

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,360
With you here,

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,240
I bet luck is on my side.

54
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,190
Master!

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
Prince!

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,630
Look carefully.

57
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,240
Yes.

58
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,190
Master!

59
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,560
Master Long!

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,150
Why would anyone come here?

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
This is the place on the map

62
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,960
Master Long brought back.

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Check every corner.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,260
Master!

65
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,310
Prince!

66
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,410
Master!

67
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,260
- Minister.
- Master Long!

68
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,860
- All taken care of.
- Prince!

69
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,640
Prince!

70
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,680
Miss!

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
They seem to work for the court.

72
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,870
Master Long!

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,600
How did they

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,020
get to this place
in the middle of nowhere?

75
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,480
Calm down.

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,070
Now that they’re here,

77
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,950
let’s play with them.

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,580
Miss!

79
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,250
- The dead can’t speak.
- Master Long!

80
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,270
So

81
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,190
the cause of all this

82
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,480
is that

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,056
Prince Zhao intended to

84
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:39,797
- take revenge for Consort De.
- Miss!

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,040
But what if they don’t buy it?

86
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,190
If not,

87
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,160
their lives end here.

88
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,920
Master Long!

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,510
Prince!

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,830
- Miss!
- Master Long!

91
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,680
General Lyu. General Lyu.

92
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,870
Minister Yuan?

93
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,190
I was wondering whose force is that.

94
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,390
So it’s yours.

95
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,680
Two princes went missing.

96
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,240
I followed the leads here.

97
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,920
Minister,

98
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,600
what brings you here?

99
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,560
Long story.

100
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,240
Prince Zhao lured Prince Jun

101
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,800
and Master Long here.

102
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,720
I found out about it

103
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,630
and followed them here to stop them.

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,890
Unfortunately, two princes

105
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,720
and Master Long...

106
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,600
What?

107
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,680
This belongs to Prince Zhao.

108
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,110
- Miss!
- Prince!

109
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,680
Follow me and see for yourselves.

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
After you, Minister.

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Master!

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,830
Master!

113
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,610
Master! Master!

114
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,830
- Prince!
- Miss!

115
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,070
There you are, Miss.

116
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,480
Prince!

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
I’m surprised you’re still alive.

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Before the wedding ceremony,

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
I asked General Lyu and his men

120
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,680
to monitor Yuan Zai’s every move.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,920
I’m sure

122
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,360
they’re on the way as we speak.

123
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,310
I’ve shown the map to him.

124
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Right now, we’re in a pit

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
filled by poisonous insects.

126
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,830
Hold on.

127
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,920
I don’t see any insects,

128
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,950
let alone the poisonous ones.

129
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,270
Look, Long.

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,510
Let’s go.

131
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,160
Alright.

132
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,070
Be careful!

133
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,830
So this is Prince Zhao’s plan all along.

134
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,080
What do you mean?

135
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,030
Aren’t you two in cahoots?

136
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,430
Prince Zhao

137
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,830
took you here on the excuse of

138
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,000
getting the Water Routes Map,

139
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,430
but actually,

140
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,510
he meant to expose my secret base.

141
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,160
He almost fooled me.

142
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,510
I underestimated him.

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,630
Where is he?

144
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,190
He chose love

145
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,600
over power

146
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,240
and opened the door to
help you escape.

147
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,200
How stupid!

148
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,600
What’s worse,

149
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,220
he tried to kill me.

150
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,800
So I had to get rid of him.

151
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,880
What?

152
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,000
You killed him?

153
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,430
Let him go,

154
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,970
and you’re safe.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,810
No!

156
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,750
Don’t be stubborn. Let go now!

157
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,830
No!

158
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,790
I’ll die with you.

159
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,320
Fine.

160
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,670
You’ll get what you wish for.

161
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,510
That was all part of his plan.

162
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,390
He volunteered to help
that old bastard

163
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,320
to kill him at the cost of his own life.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,390
He never lied to me,

165
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,390
but I didn’t believe him.

166
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,720
To avenge his

167
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,480
and my master’s murder,

168
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
Yuan Zai,

169
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,600
I’ll kill you!

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,510
Long!

171
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,120
Long!

172
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,840
You fool!

173
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,670
You want to kill me?

174
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,390
Don’t forget

175
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,750
whose place this is.

176
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,600
Prince Zhao’s plan failed.

177
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,760
Today,

178
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,580
none of you can leave.

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,650
Consort De,

180
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,620
my master,

181
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Xiaozhao,

182
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,720
all of them died in your hands.

183
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,600
And now, you want General Lyu,

184
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
Yan Bin, Xiaoqin,

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
Qingliu and me dead, too,

186
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,960
as well as these guards

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,500
and your people in the woods.

188
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,360
Yuan Zai,

189
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,770
even if we all die,

190
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,620
you still won’t stop.

191
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,100
Don’t try to buy yourself more time.

192
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,100
Forget about escaping.

193
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,410
Escape?

194
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,380
Why should I escape?

195
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,770
Tang’s prosperity lies in

196
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,170
the comfortable lives people are living.

197
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,170
But you

198
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,650
disregard national interests

199
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,260
and sacrifice people’s livelihood
for your own benefit.

200
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,140
Although my life

201
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,810
means little,

202
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,050
soon, my family

203
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,570
and all your family members

204
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,690
will all die because of him.

205
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,530
Shoot!

206
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,450
People are born equal.

207
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,690
No one is superior or inferior
to others,

208
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,900
or divided into the higher
or lower class.

209
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,340
Shoot!

210
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,570
I’m upholding justice.

211
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,530
Shoot!

212
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,140
What are they waiting for?

213
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,050
What touched off the war in the north

214
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,810
is simply personal interests.

215
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,410
Grains transported to Chang’an

216
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,620
by water to relieve the famine

217
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,500
weren’t distributed to the public.

218
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,500
You’re greedy and immoral.

219
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,810
The longer you stay,

220
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,690
the more people and the state
will suffer.

221
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,900
I’m upholding justice!

222
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,980
Shoot!

223
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,100
100 taels of gold for one target.

224
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,650
Family means more than life

225
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,050
and money.

226
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,900
Uphold justice!

227
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,500
Uphold justice!

228
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,170
Uphold justice!

229
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,810
Uphold justice!

230
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,390
Uphold justice!

231
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,270
Shoot!

232
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,530
1,000 taels of gold per person.

233
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,860
Uphold justice!

234
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,380
Uphold justice!

235
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,040
Minister, what to do?

236
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,350
Uphold justice!

237
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,590
Uphold justice!

238
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,020
Uphold justice!

239
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,610
Uphold justice!

240
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,340
- Go!
- Uphold justice!

241
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,350
No sign of him here.

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,770
Split up and find him.

243
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,390
Oh, no, we lost him.

244
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,020
Why are there so many peach trees?

245
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,500
Be careful!

246
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,900
Heaven three, earth six.

247
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,170
Does this match the 64 hexagrams?

248
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,020
Peach trees.

249
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,650
It is indeed the Eight Trigrams
of Heaven.

250
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,220
The Gate of Water is the exit.

251
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,930
Over there. Let’s go.

252
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,570
Who’d know a cave would be found

253
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,170
at the end of the peach forest?

254
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,100
Qingliu, look.

255
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,340
Fabrics, salt, pepper and metal.

256
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,900
He’s a hoarder of treasures.

257
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,690
This is his vault.

258
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,930
All these are rare to be found.

259
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,410
He must’ve bought off
the whole supply chain

260
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,340
to accumulate so much salt and iron.

261
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,410
And now,

262
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,740
he’s eager to control the water, too.

263
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,410
Once he’s in charge of

264
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,570
all key business channels,

265
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,570
chaos will surely rise.

266
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,690
Your master taught you well.

267
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,020
Even my peach formation
couldn’t stop you.

268
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,900
As fancy as it sounds,

269
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,290
it used the Eight Trigrams of Heaven.

270
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,500
Trigram 2 Lake indicates west.

271
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,050
Trigram 7 Mountain indicates
northeast.

272
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,860
Trigram 3 fire points south.

273
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,500
Trigram 6 Water points north.

274
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,860
It’s easy to crack.

275
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
Very well.

276
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,450
How about this?

277
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,780
Your master is gone.

278
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,740
Why don’t you join me?

279
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,290
I’ll teach you everything I know.

280
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,500
Then

281
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,140
you can gain

282
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,810
whatever you want.

283
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,450
You’ve reached a dead end.

284
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,530
Stop trying to manipulate me.

285
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,050
Why didn’t you escape

286
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,020
but hid here instead?

287
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,980
Because of your treasures?

288
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,440
I’m here for you two,

289
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,620
you know.

290
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,340
This place is stuffed with explosives.

291
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,020
Once they explode,

292
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,930
the whole city will see the smoke.

293
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,740
Then my people

294
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,450
will poison

295
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,930
every well in the city.

296
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,710
You’re crazy!

297
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,050
You’re dragging them

298
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,810
all down with you.

299
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,980
Them?

300
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,500
They’re dogs

301
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,900
drooling over power and wealth.

302
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,980
I loathe

303
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,620
those shameless beggars the most.

304
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,930
How dare those clowns

305
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,570
challenge heaven’s will?

306
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,170
I understand

307
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,100
why you hate them so much.

308
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,650
Because you used to be one of them.

309
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,900
You were underprivileged.

310
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,450
So you’re desperate

311
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,020
to get rid of the past.

312
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,810
Don’t think

313
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,380
you can see through me.

314
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,810
Long!

315
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,790
Long!

316
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,540
White carp!

317
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,820
Master!

318
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,690
My master saved me.

319
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,340
White carp?

320
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,380
Black carp
would shake the state.

321
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,900
The white and black craps

322
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,490
- are evenly matched.
- Black carp.

323
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,910
I’m always the master of my life,

324
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,100
yet that ends today

325
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,380
just as my master predicted.

326
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,380
Yuan Zai,

327
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,490
all those you’ve extorted

328
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
from others

329
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,860
end up

330
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,580
burying you.

331
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,970
You’re pathetic!

332
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,860
I rose from a commoner

333
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,930
to the widely acclaimed
Prime Minister.

334
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,140
I’m not pathetic,

335
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,650
but you are.

336
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Prince Jun,

337
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,380
you won’t get the antidote.

338
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,580
What do you mean?

339
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,650
Hasn’t his poison been removed?

340
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,010
Hey!

341
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,620
General,

342
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,250
these are the ones left.

343
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,820
Take them back,

344
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,140
except Qin Liang.

345
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,380
Yes.

346
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,430
Take them back expect Qin Liang.

347
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,960
- Move!
- Go! Hurry!

348
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,070
- Move!
- Go!

349
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,330
I failed,

350
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,250
so I’m at your disposal.

351
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,490
Qin Liang,

352
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,580
where did you and Yuan Zai

353
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,970
lure Miss Long to?

354
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
Bastard!

355
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:58,560
Xiaoqin.

356
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,120
Xiaoqin.

357
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,450
- Miss.
- Prince.

358
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:01,820
Are you alright?

359
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,580
It’s fine.

360
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,140
Yuan Zai is dead.

361
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,580
Qin Liang, tell me,

362
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,450
is the antidote Qingliu took fake?

363
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,860
It’s not.

364
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,060
Then why is he still poisoned?

365
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,860
There are two pills

366
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,620
and he only took one.

367
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,210
The first one could only relieve
his pain,

368
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,690
and now, the poison is acting up again.

369
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,100
Where’s the other pill?

370
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,100
Minister Yuan had it.

371
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,620
We’ve searched him

372
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,580
but found nothing.

373
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,380
Relax.

374
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,140
There must be physicians in the city

375
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,580
who can cure me.

376
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,930
The court begins!

377
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,650
Long live Your Majesty!

378
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,820
All rise!

379
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

380
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,710
Send in Guarding General

381
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,710
and Miss Long Aoyi.

382
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,250
Greetings, Your Majesty.

383
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,340
Rise.

384
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Your Majesty,

385
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,730
this is rebel Yuan Zai’s personal guard.

386
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,450
He’s confessed all that

387
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,450
Yuan Zai committed.

388
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:56,860
Good.

389
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,340
Your Majesty,

390
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,410
here are fingerprints

391
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,860
of Yuan Zai’s personal troops.

392
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,730
They only worked for him

393
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,930
for money

394
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,690
and they’ve promised to observe
the law.

395
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,860
Please be lenient with them.

396
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,100
Miss Long,

397
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,780
you’ve been expelled

398
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,780
from the palace for deception.

399
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,860
And here you are

400
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,210
begging for leniency for others?

401
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,690
Father,

402
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,150
she helped wipe out the rebels.

403
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,780
Please have mercy on her.

404
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,250
I shouldn’t have driven you mad

405
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,450
that you fell ill.

406
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,930
I’m guilty.

407
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,300
Please punish me.

408
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,860
I’m fine the entire time.

409
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,210
You did nothing wrong.

410
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,200
Actually,

411
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,170
I’m aware of

412
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,650
Yuan Zai’s evil deeds.

413
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,780
His Majesty is wise.

414
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,400
He took bribes,

415
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,780
ganged up on others for personal gains

416
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,300
and framed loyal officials.

417
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,900
How did you know that, Father?

418
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,780
You’re the head of Buyu Pavilion.

419
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,690
Buyu Pavilion seems
to be a gambling house,

420
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
but actually,

421
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,380
it serves as an intelligence agency

422
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,770
I set up for Your Majesty

423
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,100
and the state.

424
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,620
From confidential affairs

425
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,060
to officials’ every move,

426
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,620
everything is under my watch.

427
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,740
Given that Yuan Zai

428
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,840
contributed the most to
anti-corruption back then,

429
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,300
I gave him a chance to live,

430
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,030
but he gave that away.

431
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,650
I had received the tip-off long ago

432
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,340
that he planned to build
his own palace and city,

433
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,210
but

434
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,590
he was too cunning.

435
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,730
I didn’t have

436
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,380
anything concrete on him.

437
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,060
So when Prince Jun

438
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,480
asked guards to keep an eye on him,

439
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,170
I gave them permission in secret.

440
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,860
I faked my illness

442
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,450
to lower his guard down.

443
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,380
Prince Jun, Miss Long,

444
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,580
you should be rewarded

445
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,650
for your action.

446
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,970
My poor son Prince Zhao

447
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,250
pretended to work with Yuan Zai,

448
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,100
but sadly, lost his life.

449
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,140
Minister of Rites.

450
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
Yes.

451
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Pass my order.

452
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,620
The sixth prince Li Zhao

453
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,780
was a strategist

454
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,650
and a noble man,

455
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,210
thus shall be conferred
the title of Mingxin

456
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,690
and buried in the imperial mausoleum.

457
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,060
Yes.

458
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,620
I’ll see to it carefully.

459
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,750
Miss Long,

460
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,060
Yuan Zai has met his doom.

461
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,970
I’ll reorganize the court

462
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,580
for the stability and
prosperity of the state.

463
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,300
Miss Long,

464
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,540
do you understand?

465
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,060
Yes.

466
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,620
His Majesty is really something.

467
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,250
He’s been watching it the entire time.

468
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,900
Father did

469
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,450
plan out everything.

470
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,890
We went inside

471
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,010
Yuan Zai’s base

472
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,900
and found this next to Prince
Zhao’s body.

473
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,100
It has

474
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,650
nothing to do with the imperial family.

475
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,580
I’m sure His Majesty won’t mind.

476
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,340
You’re a prince of Tang.

477
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,130
This carp is for you.

478
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
This is incredible.

479
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,800
I gave it to him as a gift,

480
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,030
but I didn’t know
he’d carry it all the time.

481
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,220
= Prince Jun’s Mansion =

482
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,860
Why are you wearing a red dress?

483
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,690
Are you going to be a bride?

484
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,650
So pretty.

485
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,540
Xiaoxian.

486
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,380
There you are.

487
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,250
Who is he?

488
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,340
Him?

489
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,860
He’s also your friend.

490
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,100
He won’t hurt you.

491
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,860
We brought you

492
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,250
pork hock from the chain store.

493
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,140
You said you liked it last time,

494
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,150
so I bought some more.

495
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,380
Take this.

496
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,830
I learned a new dance.

497
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,360
Let me show you.

498
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,140
Sure.

499
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,650
Although she’s pardoned

500
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
for poisoning Crown Prince,

501
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,100
she’s still punished.

502
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,100
She lost all her memory.

503
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,100
She’s no longer hostile towards me,

504
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,580
but she still doesn’t remember you.

505
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,860
I guess

506
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,860
subconsciously,

507
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,060
she means to forget you.

508
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,210
She used to be astute,

509
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,780
but now,

510
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,970
she acts like a naive girl.

511
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,410
If forgetting me

512
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,690
can help her start over

513
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,060
to lead a simple and easy life,

514
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,490
that’s not too bad.

515
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,140
The court begins!

516
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,410
Long live Your Majesty!

517
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,010
All rise!

518
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

519
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,410
Where’s Prince Jun?

520
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,490
Your Majesty,

521
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,860
Prince Jun is taking a sick leave.

522
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,430
Imperial Physicians have all agreed

523
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,820
that his system is
severely damaged by the poison.

524
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,780
Father,

525
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,820
I went to check on him earlier.

526
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,410
There isn’t a cure.

How is he?

529
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,060
Answer me!

530
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,650
Say something!

531
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:40,970
What’s the treatment?

532
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,620
What and where’s the medicine
he needs?

533
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,730
Answer my question!

534
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,620
That poison has damaged his heart.

535
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,410
It’s almost impossible to find a cure.

536
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,780
Almost impossible?

537
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,860
So it’s still possible, right?

538
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,410
Poison has spread

539
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,540
all over his system.

540
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,780
We can...

541
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,100
We can only pray for a miracle.

542
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,930
Liar!

543
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,540
Last night, you said
you were getting better.

544
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,100
And you!

545

Cure-all,

547
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,620
but you couldn’t cure him!

548
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,330
Long,

549
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,210
I’m fine.

550
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,450
Ignore those quacks.

551
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,490
There must be

552
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,490
someone in the world who can
cure you.

553
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,210
We will find that person.

554
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,750
Do you feel better

555

after taking the medicine?

556
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,100
Much better.

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,340
He said...

695
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:17,800
that

696
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,950
their eyes are as pretty

697
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,250
as the moon.

698
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,660
Is that so?

699
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,340
She’s wrong, isn’t she?

700
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
I trust the kids

701
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,420
more than you.

702
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,300
Come here.

703
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,410
I know

704
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,450
you love me the most, don’t you?

705
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,340
Am I right?

706
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,090
If you like kids so much,

707
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,530
we can

708
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,340
make one.

709
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,700
If one isn’t enough,

710
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,320
make four or five then.

711
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,450
I’ll take care of them.

712
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,630
I can handle it. No problem at all.

713
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,180
Alright, tell me...

714
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,970
Xiaoqin!

715
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,450
It’s been 13 times.

716
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,450
I’ve proposed 13 times.

717
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,740
If you still refuse to marry me,

718
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,180
I’ll...

719
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:04,900
go out to have fun.

720
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,020
I was

721
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,970
going to say yes,

722
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,410
but hearing what you said,

723
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,000
I need to reconsider it.

724
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,020
Let’s go.

725
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:21,710
Come on.

726
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,820
Four for money.

727
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,410
Seven for fortune.
Two lotuses. A straight flush.

728
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,930
Players, show your fingers for cuts.

729
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,740
Five cuts to kill you.

730
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,120
One cut to kill you.

731
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,780
Go ahead.

732
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,780
Father,

733
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,620
Mother.

734
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:52,740
= Friend Xiaozhao’s Tomb =

735
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,660
His Majesty had you buried
in the imperial mausoleum.

736
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,610
That place is grand as a palace,

737
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,260
but looks like a cage to me.

738
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,530
I don’t think you’d like it,

739
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,860
so,

740
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,970
I took the liberty to
make you another tomb.

741
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,570
Look, isn’t the view nice?

742
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,140
= Friend Xiaozhao =

743
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,630
This one is worn,

744
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,090
so I made a new one.

745
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,860
See?

746
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,180
The two of them

747
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,790
will no longer feel lonely.

748
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,930
Bastard!

749
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,180
= Friend Xiaozhao =

750
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,130
How could I ever repay you?

751
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,660
I’ll drink first.

752
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:37,020
= Friend Xiaozhao =

753
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,220
Drink up.

754
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,970
We’re friends forever.

755
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,050
Father, Mother.

756
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,380
- Hello, sweethearts.
- There you are.

757
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:05,970
Yan Bin,

758
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,300
why aren’t you helping Xiaoqin?

759
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,990
Why are you back?

760
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,380
Here we go.

761
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,850
I’m busy, too!

762
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,780
Those two have stuck with me
since this morning.

763
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,310
And here you are playing games.

764
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,310
I want to play with you, Father.

765
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,530
Be good.

766
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,130
This is bad.

767
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,530
Then I want to be like Mother,

768
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,950
helping others in need.

769
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,270
Really? Good girl.

770
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,300
Father, Mother,

771
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,180
we saw many barbers in the streets.

772
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:34,860
Really?

773
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:35,610
Let’s have a look.

774
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,470
Come here.

775
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,270
Come on.

776
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,090
Let’s go.

777
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,410
Come.

778
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,390
Go play.

779
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,780
= Qinglong Firm =

780
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,410
= Qinglong Firm =
Stop!

781
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,490
= Qinglong Firm =
Today is February 2nd.

782
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,140
I’m coming.

783
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:49,930
Dragon Heads-raising Day.

784
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,180
It occurred to me

785
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,130
when the kids mentioned the barbers.

786
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,410
How long have we known each other?

787
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:58,660
Six years in total.

788
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,710
Catch me if you can.

789
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,060
You aren’t too heartless.

790
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,090
Back at Wanhua,

791
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,130
I almost kicked you to death.

792
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,700
- Luckily, you didn’t.
- Stop!

793
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,410
Or who would you marry?

794
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,930
- Thanks to the antidote,
- Stop there!

795
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,840
I didn’t end up as a widow.

796
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,540
Without Father’s permission,

797
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,030
we wouldn’t be able to leave either.

798
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,880
That was because I handed in the map.

799
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:18,970
Never mind.

800
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,130
Forget about all that.

801
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,450
- The past is the past.
- Catch me.

802
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,110
Slow down.

803
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,320
This is our sixth anniversary.

804
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,780
How should we celebrate it?

805
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,260
How about

806
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,380
we go to the gambling house?

807
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,930
Every time we were there,

808
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,410
others all fled in the end.

809
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,010
No one would play with us.

810
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,570
That’s true.

811
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,010
We can

812
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,900
drink together at the brothel.

813
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,570
Pass.

814
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,340
Brothels along the river

815
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,220
have become entertainment houses

816
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,890
following your order.

817
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,970
Are there still girls

818
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,710
to serve you?

819
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,010
I have an idea.

820
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,740
Why don’t we make another baby

821
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:50,740
on the way to India?

822
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,010
Yes. Good.

823
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,240
I want a baby sister

824
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,660
so that I can braid her hair.

825
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:01,930
Let me down.

826
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:02,660
