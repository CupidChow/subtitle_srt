00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,430
You can go.

174
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,870
Yes, Manager Yan.

175
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,820
= Xinsilu =

176
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,060
Are you sure you won’t come
to Chang’an with me?

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,870
I’m old,

178
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,430
blind,

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,950
and deaf.

180
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,070
So I won’t be any trouble.

181
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,480
Just pretend to be confused.

182
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,000
Everyone knows that

183
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
it is much more relaxed here
than in the palace.

184
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,040
OK. I don’t force you.

185
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,040
These two capable maids will stay

186
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,800
and take care of you.

187
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,190
If you are not used to

188
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
living in a suburban house,

189
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,830
just write to me.

190
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,390
I’ll have someone replace it for you.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,360
And if you don’t have enough money...

192
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,040
It’s enough...

193
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,510
I’m not really old yet.

194
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,240
I’ll come back and see you.

195
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,600
The vase of peony flower...

196
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,390
I know.

197
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,360
I know you can’t let it go.

198
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,950
I know you.

199
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
Just go.

200
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,160
Take care.

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,460
Just go.

202
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,420
= Xinsilu =

203
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,820
= Xinsilu =

204
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,440
Ma’am.

205
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,510
Can you give this to

206
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,600
= For Xiaoqin =
Xiaoqin?

207
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,550
OK.

208
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,240
Take care of him.

209
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,980
= For Long Aoyi =

210
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,700
= Xinsilu =

211
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,270
Be slow.

212
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,080
The Silk Store is closing.

213
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,750
But I don’t want to leave.

214
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,390
Although it will be shut down for a year,

215
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,870
it is actually okay.

216
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,770
We don’t have to work,

217
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,270
but we can still get paid.

218
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,030
But I have four sisters at home...

219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,750
What should I do?

220
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,080
I’m with you.

221
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,870
There’s always a way.

222
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,870
Let’s go inside.

223
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,910
Go.

224
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,940
= Xinsilu =

225
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,320
Stop, I’ll go.

226
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,320
Long.

227
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,510
These are Qingliu’s flowers for you.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,910
Besides this,

229
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,840
does he have any other message?

230
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,120
He, he...

231
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,870
This is from Yan Bin.

232
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,200
Thank you.

233
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,750
Ma’am.

234
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,080
Take care of yourself.

235
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,790
I’ll see you later.

236
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,000
I’ll go now.

237
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,980
= Tea =

238
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,980
= For Xiaoqin =

239
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,150
Just read it.

240
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,440
For Xiaoqin.

241
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
I did not want to go to Chang’an,

242
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,150
and Master intended to let me stay.

243
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,150
But he treated me well,

244
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,030
just like you and Master Long.

245
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
We’re not just master and servant,

246
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,120
but like brothers.

247
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,360
Now Master enters the palace alone,

248
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,440
there is not even a close people.

249
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,150
I worry about him.

250
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Master Long values feelings.

251
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,390
I think

252
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,910
you should understand me.

253
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,550
In addition,

254
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,440
this is the key to the Li’s Bank.

255
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,320
10,000 pieces of silk is inside.

256
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,790
This can be helpful to you.

257
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,510
Yan Bin.

258
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,750
Your buddy is important, huh?
Why don’t you marry him?

259
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,600
He just wants to follow the Prince

260
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
into the palace.

261
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,790
He pretended to have integrity.

262
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,240
If he says this in front of me,

263
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,080
I’ll beat up

264
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
this bad guy.

265
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,600
He is better than

266
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,320
someone who didn’t leave a word.

267
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,790
Miss.

268
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,630
What should we do?

269
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,580
= Qinglong =

270
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,790
Gengzi, I put it here for you.

271
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,270
Come in, please.

272
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,010
Gengzi, Skinny.

273
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Look who is here.

274
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,620
They are...

275
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,000
They are brothers from the Silk Store.

276
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah.

277
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,390
Listen to me.

278
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,960
Master said that

279
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
anyone in the Silk Store

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
who is willing to come to work with us,

281
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,440
doesn’t need any assessment.

282
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,150
As the saying goes, a single thread
makes no thread,

283
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,030
a single tree makes no forest.

284
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,960
That’s right.

285
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,600
All we have to do is to stick together.

286
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,030
We can make it

287
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,510
as good as Xinsilu.

288
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,240
Okay?

289
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

290
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

291
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,980
Where’s Long?

292
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,270
What’s going on?

293
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,240
Your Highness.

294
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,870
Her Grace wants us to go back immediately.

295
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,120
Let’s not delay.

296
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,150
No hurry.

297
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,080
Such a little time.

298
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,200
Yes.

299
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,480
Qinglong.

300
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,390
Are we going the right way?

301
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,150
Take a look inside.

302
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

303
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,390
If it takes half a month,

304
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,440
- I’m guessing that our team
- our last payment

305
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,120
- will lose money on the way.
- plus this. Right?

306
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,550
- Prince Zhao.
- Prince Zhao.

307
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Prince Zhao.

308
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,360
Where is your master?

309
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
She’s not here.

310
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,000
No?

311
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,360
What are you doing?

312
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,320
Table Discussion.

313
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,790
Longzhu Gang and Xinsilu

314
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,870
formed a new store,

315
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,200
Qinglong.

316
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Qinglong?

317
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,080
What about the old one?

318
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,150
Well, we can run the canal transport.

319
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
The dragon’s in the water.

320
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,360
Then three more points.

321
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Oh. Who made the rule?

322
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,320
Master.

323
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,600
Where is she?

324
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,830
I don’t know. Before she left,

325
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,880
she left a Ten Laws for Qinglong.

326
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,240
She said goodbye.

327
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,100
And she disappeared with Xiaoqin.

328
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,060
= Ten Laws for Qinglong =

329
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:53,340
= Tomb of Tan Song, Feng Ge =

330
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,830
Master.

331
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,240
You let me not go to Chang’an.

332
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,350
The murder must be there.

333
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
I must find him

334
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,440
and avenge you.

335
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,720
Your Highness.

336
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,110
There is no trace
of Miss Long in the places

337
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,510
where the girls
of Wuyun Pavilion mentioned.

338
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,400
Maybe because of Feng,

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
she doesn’t want to show up.

340
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,270
What should I do?

341
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Calm down.

342
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,440
How?

343
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,640
I just went to the Wuyun Pavilion.

344
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,200
I just knew Feng had died.

345
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,120
Something so important had happened,

346
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,350
why didn’t she come to me?

347
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,110
I like her so much.

348
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,920
But at such time,

349
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,110
I can’t help at all.

350
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,750
Your Highness.

351
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,720
When Miss Long calms down,

352
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,270
perhaps she will show up.

353
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,310
She must be very sad now.

354
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,160
Feng once told me

355
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,550
that her mother

356
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,240
died while giving birth to her.

357
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,110
Her father

358
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,240
was killed by runaway bandits

359
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,980
when she was young.

360
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
She was an orphan at a young age.

361
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,090
So she grew up on others

362
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,310
without any family’s protection.

363
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,640
But now,

364
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,830
her only family was dead.

365
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,400
I have to find her.

366
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,270
I must find her.

367
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,830
But you must obey Her Grace’s edict.

368
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
Master Li

369
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,790
has taken the throne
and gone back to Chang’an.

370
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,400
You’d better go back as soon as possible

371
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,310
and let Her Grace relieved.

372
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,070
Besides,

373
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,880
even if we go to look for Miss Long,

374
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
we are aimless.

375
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,680
Why don’t we just go back now?

376
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,730
When things are settled down,

377
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,600
we’ll go out to look for her.

378
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,880
Your Highness, it’s getting late.

379
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,400
Let’s go.

380
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,160
Prince Jun.

381
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,110
This is the secretary in charge sent
by the Ministry of War.

382
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,920
You will be informed of the pilgrimages
of the princes

383
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,750
and officials.

384
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,000
This is the nannies assigned
by Concubine De.

385
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,890
She’ll serve you.

386
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,430
Thank you.

387
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,920
Your Majesty is here.

388
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,200
Come on.

389
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,160
Let me see you.

390
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,240
Get off.

391
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,070
Qingliu.

392
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,550
Yes.

393
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,710
Your Majesty.

394
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,920
Call me Father.

395
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,340
Though there are so many literati,

396
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,880
someone chooses to live as heroes.

397
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,960
That’s a great name.

398
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,070
Yes, Father.

399
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,640
You lived a hard life all these years.

400
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,750
From now on,

401
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,290
you are a prince,

402
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,330
my son,

403
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,350
and no longer a merchant.

404
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,640
You must use your strength and ability

405
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,750
to deal with the country issues.

406
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,160
As you command.

407
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,000
As soon as I saw you,

408
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,640
I thought of Concubine Cui.

409
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,480
I can’t find her for years.

410
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,240
But I’ve never forgotten

411
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,590
her face and smile.

412
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,920
Today,

413
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,960
we are reunited finally.

414
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,480
Follow me.

415
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,790
We have a good chat at Imperial Study.

416
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,060
= Dongshi Market =

417
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,350
= Chonghua Lane =

418
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,000
Miss.

419
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,440
Although Xiaowu has drawn many patterns.

420
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,790
He also said that

421
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,750
the White Fancy Carp

422
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,110
may be made by craftsmen in Chang’an.

423
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
But we come to Chang’an like this.

424
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,030
It may be in vain.

425
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,070
We can’t let anything go.

426
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Before Master died, she repeatedly

427
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,890
told me not to come to Chang’an.

428
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,850
And I had told her many times before

429
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,820
that I wanted to come to Chang’an,
but she refused,

430
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,650
saying that Chang’an was boring.

431
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,540
But why should we go anywhere

432
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,850
but Chang’an?

433
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,650
The jade pendant and Chang’an

434
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,300
must have had something to do

435
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,130
with Master’s death.

436
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,740
All right.

437
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,540
We’ve come all this way.

438
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,690
Let’s have

439
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,850
a good dinner.

440
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,740
I’ve

441
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,500
asked around

442
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,820
all over Chang’an.

443
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,850
It’s

444
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
an old must-have restaurant

445
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,060
in Chang’an.

446
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,690
Go.

447
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,410
I’m here for Master.

448
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,610
If you want to hang out,

449
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,740
we’ll split up.

450
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:15,890
Miss.

451
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,890
I also keep

452
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,930
that in mind.

453
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,370
Drinking, poetry and games.

454
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,060
As if it were yesterday.

455
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,610
If I run into that bad guy,

456
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,300
I’ll be the first one to fight.

457
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,340
But there are so many people

458
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,450
in Chang’an.

459
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,020
Where should we start?

460
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,340
How much time and effort it takes?

461
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,540
You don’t want to eat these days,

462
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,740
and you have lost weight.

463
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
If you don’t eat,

464
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,340
how can you avenge Feng?

465
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,340
All right.

466
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,500
Chang’an is so big.

467
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,850
And it’s a beautiful day.

468
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,500
There’s not a lot of lower class.

469
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,460
= Jinjiang Hock Restaurant =

470
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,100
Why is there no one here?

471
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,410
Order.

472
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,260
Yes.

473
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,060
What do you want to eat?

474
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,260
Weihe River Boneless Fresh Minced Fish.

475
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,340
Gone.

476
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,500
Well.

477
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,820
Rosefinch Roasted Duck
with Salt and Pepper.

478
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,170
Gone.

479
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,540
How about Jiangnan Garlic Raw Amaranth?

480
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,580
No.

481
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,820
Then what do you have?

482
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,610
Steamed cake, pancake, butter cake.

483
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,650
Two pancakes with more garlic.

484
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,850
Okay.

485
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,500
Two pancakes with more garlic.

486
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:52,980
Okay.

487
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,410
Your father asked where you were going.

488
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,980
Your uncle said that

489
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,820
you couldn’t let go of the heavy task

490
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,780
your father entrusted you with.

491
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,020
You are worried that the taxation
of Jiannan Dao

492
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,690
is not fulfilled well.

493
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,210
Your father believed that.

494
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,370
Stand up.

495
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:10,930
Yes.

496
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,410
Thank you, Uncle.

497
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,340
Mother.

498
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,340
I heard it’s famine year.

499
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,300
I’m concerned about

500
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,850
the livelihood of the people
in Silver City.

501
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Your Highness.

502
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,170
It’s right to worry about

503
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,340
our people.

504
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,690
But remember.

505
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,210
You should be more diligent in politics

506
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,690
than worrying about the people.

507
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,340
So that you can secure

508
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,610
your position in His Majesty’s heart.

509
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,020
And it’s not in vain for

510
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,300
what Her Grace has been doing.

511
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,100
Mother.

512
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,650
Father was searching for the prince
who’s been living off the palace.

513
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,100
He never told you that?

514
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,300
When did you and Uncle find out that?

515
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,730
We just

516
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,730
found out about it.

517
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,490
You don’t need to worry about that.

518
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,340
Now it is different.

519
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,170
The new prince is in the palace.

520
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,060
I heard he is capable.

521
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,770
You can’t

522
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,880
go on such a tour.

523
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,930
Whether the power of the Pang family

524
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,780
will be stable or not

525
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,240
will depend on you.

526
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,270
Don’t worry.

527
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,960
Prince Zhao knows it.

528
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,440
I just say more.

529
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,890
Since ancient times,
in the imperial family,

530
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,310
there are so many compatriots

531
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,590
killing each other.

532
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,000
Just remember.

533
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,200
From now on,

534
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,790
you should stay away

535
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,550
from the new prince.

536
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,590
Yes.

537
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,550
Twenty cents.

538
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,330
Twenty cents?

539
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,790
A mistake?

540
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,790
We just ordered two pancakes.

541
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,480
Yes.

542
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,070
It was five cents each
when we just entered.

543
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,000
Why is it twenty cents?

544
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,790
The price goes up at the checkout.

545
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,640
Illicit shop.

546
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,070
Shut up.

547
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,790
If you don’t have money,

548
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,550
don’t come to the restaurants in Chang’an.

549
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,480
Sir.

550
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,830
We’re new to Chang’an.

551
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,350
If you’re offended, please let us know.

552
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,840
Harmony breeds wealth.

553
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,790
If you have something to say,

554
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,750
just say it.

555
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Now in Chang’an,

556
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
time is money.

557
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,920
You evil-minded profiteer.

558
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,490
You robbed us.

559
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
We can’t explain it.

560
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,640
We have no time to waste.

561
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,810
- Give it to him.
- Sir.

562
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,880
Sir.

563
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,070
The grain price

564
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,070
has gone up for another 10 percent.

565
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,480
Another 10 percent?

566
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,200
Six cents short.

567
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,310
You must be desperate for money.

568
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,510
Can you blame me?

569
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,240
Why don’t you go out and find out

570
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,830
what’s going on in the grain market?

571
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,790
If you don’t pay,

572
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,310
don’t blame me if the price goes up later.

573
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,240
You’re just in time.

574
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,350
It’s well spent.

575
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,310
Hey.

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,920
Can you show us

577
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,750
the biggest canal market in Chang’an?

578
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,590
There will be a reward.

579
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,030
What?

580
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,240
Would you like to buy some grain too?

581
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,310
You’d better hurry.

582
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,740
Or the price will go up again.

583
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,200
I do canal transport.

584
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,350
The new Qinglong

585
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,790
ships the grain here.

586
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,280
I am worried about no place to sell it.

587
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,200
Lead the way.

588
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,550
Okay.

589
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,440
Excuse me.

590
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,070
What? Another price rise?

591
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,200
How dare I?

592
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,450
There is a famine in the surrounding area.

593
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,510
Prices are rising in the city.

594
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,070
All kinds of food are in short supply.

595
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,460
I can’t make a meal without rice.

596
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,030
Ah, there’s a reason for that.

597
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,590
Well, you can give me

598
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,590
a list of all the ingredients you need.

599
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,740
I’ll see what I can do.

600
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,640
If you

601
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,270
can solve our urgent problem,

602
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,270
we will

603
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,030
never accept

604
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,680
your money.

605
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,200
Hey.

606
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,200
Show off our cooking skills

607
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,420
to them from afar.

608
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,960
Let’s treat them.

609
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:56,540
Okay.

610
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,830
- Sit down, please.
- Sit down.

611
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,340
Come on.

612
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,180
= Court of Censors =

613
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,400
Mr. Pang.

614
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,240
I’m sorry

615
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
for my thoughtlessness for your sudden arrival.

616
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,350
Forgive me, please.

617
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,400
Mr. Du, don’t be so polite.

618
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,110
Xiaoxian, greet Mr. Pang.

619
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,750
Greetings, Mr. Pang.

620
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,170
Your daughter

621
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,250
is so beautiful.

622
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,770
Thanks.

623
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,450
Her mother died since she was a child.

624
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,340
I brought her up.

625
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,900
She is new to Chang’an,

626
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,480
and knows little about the world.

627
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,760
Your daughter is exquisite

628
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,090
and elegant.

629
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,590
Recently, Yan

630
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,520
and other children

631
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,870
read, ride and shoot together.

632
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,950
They are about the same age,

633
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,900
so they can go for a walk together.

634
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,900
Father.

635
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,690
I’ll show Yan around

636
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,410
and let her get familiar with here.

637
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,370
Yan.

638
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,140
Please come with me.

639
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,780
Okay.

640
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,860
Sir.

641
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,760
Did you know that

642
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,740
the man in the Silk Store is the Prince?

643
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,100
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

644
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,730
I nearly

645
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,690
killed myself.

646
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,740
Are you blaming me?

647
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,820
Don’t you remember

648
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,620
who saved you

649
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,440
and withheld

650
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,710
the secret letter?

651
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,780
It was full of evidence

652
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,330
of your wanton appropriation

653
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,580
of the property of your inferiors.

654
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,060
I don’t dare.

655
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,680
I know that

656
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,790
= Customs Seal =
you pity me.

657
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,160
So you helped me secretly.

658
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,880
But it does keep me

659
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,890
up at night.

660
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,980
On the one hand, I offended the Prince.

661
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,820
On the other,

662
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,760
the matter of the secret letter
is still pending.

663
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,160
I beg your pities.

664
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,740
I’ll obey you

665
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,930
forever.

666
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,700
= Customs Seal =

667
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,530
I’ve heard that your daughter

668
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,460
is very close to the new prince.

669
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,470
Since they have such feelings,

670
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,110
why not let them get married?

671
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,690
What does this mean?

672
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,650
Once the relationship changes,

673
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,560
national affairs
will become family affairs,

674
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,820
and major events will become trifles.

675
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,540
It’s so wise of you.

676
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,740
It’s

677
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,970
for my daughter’s sake.

678
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,410
If Her Grace can help me

679
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,110
find a good son-in-law,

680
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,930
I will give her all I got

681
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,100
in Silver City.

682
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,420
= Inn =

683
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,410
Miss.

684
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,780
This is the place Weng Dayou sent someone

685
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
to prepare for us.

686
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,780
When that boss heard that

687
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,740
we were here for canal transport,

688
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,210
he changed his attitude.

689
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,210
Before we left,

690
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,580
he gave me a flagon of wine.

691
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,050
On the other hand,

692
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,570
the canal transport men traveled far,

693
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,810
so they know many people.

694
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,250
We haven’t even reached Chang’an,

695
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,290
and they’ve already
booked this hotel room.

696
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,580
But

697
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,690
the room is too small.

698
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,890
It’s a bit deserted.

699
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,650
It’s more than that.

700
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,740
Didn’t you notice that

701
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,210
we’ve got a company along the way?

702
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:36,980
Who?

703
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,580
Miss! At this time,

704
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
you’re still joking.

705
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,690
This wine is poisonous?

706
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,130
That boss?

707
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,410
If he wanted to poison us,

708
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,650
would you still be here

709
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,020
after you ate so much?

710
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,340
We have just shown our wealth,

711
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,710
and we’re new here.

712
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,780
So they thought that if we die,

713
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,500
nobody cares if they rob the money.

714
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,860
Go get some more wine,

715
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,170
so we can treat our companies.

716
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,290
They didn’t take the money?

717
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,500
They’re not easy to deal with. Leave here.

718
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,210
Come on, take a look.

719
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,650
All kinds of gadgets.

720
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,250
Come on.

721
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,080
Take a look.

722
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,810
Fresh vegetables.

723
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,380
I’ll take this.

724
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,040
Come here.

725
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,660
Okay.

726
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,980
= Tao’s Antiques =

727
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,810
The seventh store on Zhuque Street.

728
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,060
That’s the place.

729
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,980
Miss, who wants to hurt you?

730
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,730
Du Changfeng?

731
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,130
But even if you knew

732
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,460
he was corrupt.

733
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,290
You can’t go to

734
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,650
His Majesty to sue him
at the imperial court.

735
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,460
He won’t go after you, right?

736
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,540
You’re right.

737
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,500
Not him.

738
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,900
If he wanted to kill us,

739
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,690
he wouldn’t do this.

740
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,160
Such a short time...

741
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,650
Since we’ve come to Chang’an,

742
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,060
we can go to Master Li.

743
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,620
This thing and Feng.

744
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,250
He can help us more or less.

745
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,020
Don’t mention him again.

746
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,540
If you do that again,

747
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,940
don’t follow me.

748
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,420
= Pawnshop =

749
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,130
Who and what?

750
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,250
I’m here for Second Master Lyu.

751
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,730
Who are you?

752
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,690
How dare you arrest Long Aoyi?

753
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,060
When I get out, I’ll kill you.

754
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,460
I won’t let you go.

755
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,100
Who?

756
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,980
- Second Master.
- Second Master.

757
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:14,940
Mr. Lyu.

758
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,810
Master, you don’t have to do this.

759
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,380
There are no outsiders.

760
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,900
Although I could no longer work
for Longzhu Gang,

761
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,860
I belong to it forever.

762
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,980
Master, please.

763
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,770
Thank you.

764
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,020
Master.

765
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,940
The new prince has just arrived here.

766
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,420
The political situation in the palace

767
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,980
is very complex.

768
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,730
All the forces are in move.

769
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,380
As a leader,

770
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,460
it is my duty to protect the new prince.

771
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,580
Don’t worry.

772
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,530
Second Master.

773
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,580
Master, that’s okay.

774
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,900
In Silver City,

775
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,290
you cared me very much.

776
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,290
I can do anything

777
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,810
for you.

778
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,250
But now is not the time.

779
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,060
I can’t arrange a meeting
for the Prince and you.

780
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,690
Forgive me, Master. I made a mistake.

781
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,170
I don’t want to see anyone.

782
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,940
Let alone it.

783
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,460
I have two important things

784
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,290
to tell you.

785
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,170
Recently Chang’an saw soaring prices.

786
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,460
We started

787
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Qinglong Firm.

788
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,060
We want to open a shop here,

789
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,770
and also to settle down.

790
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,650
So

791
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,500
I want you to help me find a place.

792
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,100
Don’t worry.

793
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,500
I’ve arranged it for you

794
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,650
on the way just now.

795
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,380
The owner of the antique shop

796
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,170
will find you a safe place.

797
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,900
I can’t be around to take care of you.

798
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,130
These money is for you.

799
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,130
Ah. I’ll take it then.

800
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:53,980
Thank you.

801
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,130
So much?

802
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,730
Xiaoqin, if you don’t take it,

803
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,210
you’re treating me like an outsider.

804
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,650
Master.

805
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,970
Just say the second one.

806
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,060
Have you ever seen this before?

807
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,170
That looks familiar.

808
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,130
Can you remember that?

809
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,440
Or anyone else

810
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,770
knows where it came from?

811
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,060
Buyu Pavilion.

812
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,250
Master.

813
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,420
In Chang’an,

814
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,210
there is a place called Buyu Pavilion.

815
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,250
It’s a high-class gambling shop.

816
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,580
But they’re secretly

817
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,540
running

818
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,020
a secret information exchange.

819
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,250
Even the old news
in the palace can be traced.

820
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,420
Buyu Pavilion.

821
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,540
Master, why are you asking about this?

822
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,290
Nothing.

823
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,210
Well, we’ll leave.

824
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,210
If you need help, just let me know.

825
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,900
Take care.

826
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,090
