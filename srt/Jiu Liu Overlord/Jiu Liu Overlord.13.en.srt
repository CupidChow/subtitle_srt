It’s only lying down together. Who cares?

We are good dudes. Let’s go.

Well, let’s go?

35

Let’s go!

36
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,780
Then how about

37
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,060
I’ll lie down.

38
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,500
I’ll lie down.

Go ahead. Prove it for us.

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,750
Come on.

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
Everyone, did you see it?

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,180
It’s no problem even if
you roll on this bed.

43
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,940
Just buy it!

44
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,340
But it!

45
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,940
Give it to me.

46
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,660
I want one.

47
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,460
Pay money first.

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,240
Pay the money.

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,690
I’ll have two.

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,280
Give it to me.

51
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,490
Okay. Here you are.

52
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,120
I’ll have two.

53
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,580
Here you are.

54
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:21,860
I’ll have one.

55
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,730
Here you are.

56
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,800
I’ll have one.

57
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,090
Pay the money.

58
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,620
I’ll have two.

59
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,740
Second Master, your dance today...

60
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,780
Second Master, your dance today...

61
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,660
- I didn’t realize that...
- Yes.

62
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,740
Fatty,

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,460
I’ll throw you into the lake to feed fish.

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,220
Go.

65
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,860
Help!

66
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,460
One, two.

67
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,300
Don’t make trouble.

68
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,060
Everyone, thanks for your efforts.

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,420
Master.

70
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,660
60 wen per person as the dividend.

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,620
Master.

72
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,540
It’s more than what you promised before.

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,380
Today we sold two hundred items.

74
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,700
And we also received many orders.

75
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,660
The profits are already much higher
than expected.

76
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,340
Come and share it with everyone.

77
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,300
Yours.

78
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,780
When masters of other gangs earn money,

79
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,460
they’ll buy themselves lands and houses.

80
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,780
But our master is different.

81
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,820
Whenever she has got money,
she will always share the money

82
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,500
with us.

83
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:04,980
Sure.

84
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,580
Xiaoqin,

85
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,260
Take it.

86
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,940
Thank you, Second Master.

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,660
That much?

88
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,260
Our success this time

89
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,300
is all due to everyone’s busy work.

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,220
Yes...

91
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,500
And Xiaozhao’s help.

92
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,580
So, thank yourselves, if you want.

93
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,300
Besides, Master once told me that

94
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,500
One shouldn’t worry about poverty, but...

95
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,860
- But should worry about the…
- But...

96
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
One shouldn’t worry about poverty,
but the unequal distribution of resources.

97
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,980
Therefore, you deserve it.

98
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,660
But don’t splurge the money.

99
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,340
Don’t splurge the money.

100
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,260
Thank you. Master.

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,420
Thank you. Master.

102
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,860
Get a piece of it.

103
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,700
Take it yourselves.

104
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,420
Now we are rich!

105
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,900
Come and take the bowls yourselves.

106
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,940
Smells good.

107
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,580
Sis!

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,380
Why are you so happy tonight?

109
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,420
You even give out meat.

110
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,100
When I make more money,

111
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,860
I’ll buy you extra vegetables
and meat every day.

112
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,540
Well,

113
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,100
Thank you.

114
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,340
I want this big one.

115
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:54,980
OK.

116
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,380
It smells so good.

117
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Yes, sister.

118
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Will we gain weight if we eat too much?

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,160
You don’t know that.

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
I learned that in the Country of Wo,

121
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,840
women eat that to make themselves beauty.

122
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,960
Eat more.

123
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,280
OK.

124
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Eat more.

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,960
Master Long. Come and eat with us.

126
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
No, thanks. I eat these every day.

127
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
I’m already sick of that.

128
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Have a big piece.

129
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,700
- There you are!
- Master.

130
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,020
I kept a big piece for you.

131
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,310
- Master. Master.
- Master.

132
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,380
Look.

133
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,460
The two of us

134
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,460
are in the same boat.

135
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,580
Why don’t we become sworn brothers?

136
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,940
In Longzhu Gang, we don’t have

137
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,660
particular rules.

138
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,060
We don’t need to drink blood liquor.

139
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,820
nor kowtow and exchange name cards.

140
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Just spit saliva

141
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,380
in each other’s bowls.

142
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,980
So?

143
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,660
Merging the saliva.

144
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,340
Did you and Prince Zhao also do so?

145
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,860
Are you nuts?

146
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,820
Here! Come!

147
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,780
You. Listen to my explanation.

148
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,460
I’m waiting.

149
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,860
I’ve investigated.
Many shops in Silver City

150
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,500
sell copycat goods of Xinsilu.

151
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,860
But you didn’t mind it. Besides...

152
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,060
You have Prince Zhao to back you up.

153
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,380
So you are unscrupulous

154
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,220
to imitate the design of
the pillows of Xinsilu

155
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,860
which is not yet released for profit.

156
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,780
You seem to be designing
new products for Xinsilu.

157
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,220
but in fact,

158
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,260
you are making use of me
in every possible way.

159
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,700
Be polite.

160
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,700
I didn’t mean to make use of anyone.

161
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,460
Now you are still lying.

162
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,100
Don’t you stay at the Silk Store

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,740
only for this?

164
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,420
= Eighty-five thousand
and nine hundred taels =

165
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,940
So you already knew it.

166
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,540
I invested on your shop.

167
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,940
You disguise yourself with the name
“Chubby”.

168
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,300
Do you think I can’t find it out?

169
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,140
You really saved for her?

170
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,420
I’m too naive.

171
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,420
I thought since you designed
the bellyband and pillows,

172
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,660
and also called yourself
“Master of Design Hall”,

173
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,340
you must be  fond of this business.

174
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,580
And I even thought

175
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,780
even if you get the money
of your gang back,

176
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,020
you would still sincerely

177
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,860
stay at Xinsilu.

178
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,260
That’s what I thought.

179
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,460
And I can swear

180
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,300
I never thought of
competing with Silk Store.

181
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,820
Your goods are nice,

182
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,460
but they are too expensive.

183
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,780
The people in the lower class,
let alone buying them,

184
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,580
they even can’t go into your shop.

185
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,180
The reason why Prince Zhao
helped me make this

186
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,220
is that it’s both cheap and useful.

187
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
People can use good things

188
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,540
at the cost of the price
of several steam buns.

189
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,100
So?

190
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,380
fundamentally, we have different things.

191
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,660
And we sell them ​​to different people.

192
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,820
What you deserve to earn

193
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,700
will never go into the money bag
of Longzhu Gang.

194
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,060
So you admit that you and Prince Zhao

195
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,100
did these secretly?

196
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,740
I said so much.

197
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,420
But you still think I’m making use of you.

198
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,220
It seems that you and Prince Zhao
had plotted it a long time ago.

199
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,900
Mind your words!

200
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
What do you mean by plotting?

201
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,940
He is also a sworn brother of mine.

202
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,500
So he can help me unconditionally.

203
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,540
Being sworn brothers doesn’t mean
you can hug in public

204
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,300
as if showing everyone that you are
as intimate as husband and wife?

205
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,780
What are you talking about?

206
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,900
Oh, it makes sense.

207
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,340
After all I am a rascal in your eyes.

208
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,340
There is so much money.

209
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,340
I’ll take it.

210
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,300
Thank you.

211
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Now we are even.

212
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,740
Today,

213
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,340
there is no relationship between us.

214
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,260
Stop!

215
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,980
Clean up your stuff before you go.

216
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,780
Rest assured.

217
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,180
I’ll take each of them away.

218
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,540
I won’t make you disgusted.

219
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Master Long.

220
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Master Long.

221
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:34,020
= Xinsilu =

222
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,780
= Xinsilu =

223
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,740
Throw all of them away.

224
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,420
This smell is disgusting.

225
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,980
Qingliu.

226
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,100
Master Long is used to be free.

227
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,040
How can she really be used to
our rules here?

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,440
It’s true that she has designs on
our business.

229
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,080
Just drive her away.

230
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
Don’t be upset.

231
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
People in the gangs

232
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,480
will not have mutual affection on us.

233
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
Once the cost is recovered,

234
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
they will turn their back on us.

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
Why bother being upset? Let’s go.

236
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,640
You were kicked out like this?

237
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,240
No?

238
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,360
You are wrong. I left by myself.

239
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,400
Li Qingliu

240
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,320
isn’t a decent man.

241
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,400
I used to think he was nice.

242
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,320
But he turns his back on me
when it comes to money.

243
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,880
It seems that men are not reliable at all.

244
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,480
Li Qingliu and Prince Zhao,

245
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
who do you like more?

246
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,040
The two of them?

247
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,040
I don’t want to count on either of them.

248
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,360
I

249
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,800
I have to rely on myself for everything.

250
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,920
You are reluctant to admit.

251
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,480
I think you are different

252
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,760
from before.

253
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,280
The answer is in your mind.

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
Nonsense.

255
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,760
= Clouds in Yi City =
I don’t want anyone in my life.

256
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,200
But Master,

257
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,520
When it comes to affection,

258
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
I really can’t understand.

259
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,240
I can’t understand.

260
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
Drink more, and you’ll understand.

261
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,240
Let’s drink.

262
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,800
Master.

263
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,420
Master.

264
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,300
Second Master.

265
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,780
How do you know I’m here?

266
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,540
I went to Silk Store. They said you left.

267
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,580
What’s wrong?

268
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Qiyan is found.

269
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,580
Really?

270
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,180
Really.

271
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,460
That’s why I came immediately.

272
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,660
Master,

273
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,140
Don’t drink yourself, wait for me.

274
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,180
Why are you leaving so soon?
You just came back.

275
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,860
I’m bored again.

276
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,700
Stop!

277
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,380
Second Master.

278
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,700
Aren’t you tired of following
me all night?

279
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,240
My feet are heavy and I’m sleepy.

280
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,200
I’m going back to sleep.

281
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
How could it be you?

282
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,980
Crap.

283
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,380
Your guess is right.

284
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,940
I’m afraid Master Qiyan is
with Master Long.

285
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,220
Master Qiyan.

286
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,180
Master Qiyan.

287
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,180
Incompetent bungler.

288
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,380
It’s of no use for me to keep you.

289
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,820
Master Qiyan,

290
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,860
forgive me.

291
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,700
Master Qiyan.

292
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,540
Let go of me, Master Qiyan!

293
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,620
Wait.

294
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,700
Isn’t it the famous Master Long?

295
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,380
Do you come to my thatched house

296
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,180
to have an intimate date
under the moonlight with me?

297
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,060
Nonsense!

298
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,900
Go.

299
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,300
Vendor Zhou.

300
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,940
Vendor Zhou.

301
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,140
Why?

302
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,220
Master Long.

303
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,460
Aren’t you very powerful?

304
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,140
I wanted to say that
I could have imputed

305
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,500
the loss of the gold threads of
Xinsilu to you.

306
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,660
But I didn’t expect that
you found the threads.

307
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,820
And the fire in those three yards

308
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,900
couldn’t burn you to death.

309
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,940
Since you don’t want to die,

310
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,180
I’ll kill him.

311
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,020
What do you think?

312
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,220
Master Long.

313
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,780
Where are you going? Come back.

314
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,850
Catch the murderer alive!

315
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,260
Long Aoyi.

316
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,380
You dare to kill him to prevent
divulgence of your fault!

317
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,540
Arrest her!

318
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,020
Commissioner Du, you come in time.

319
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,300
But may I ask

320
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,580
with which one of your eyes
did you see me killing people?

321
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,180
We caught you with all the evidence.
Don’t quibble.

322
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,220
Take her!

323
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,740
Who dares?

324
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,140
Your Highness,

325
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,980
I don’t know why you

326
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,020
came to the wilderness at midnight?

327
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,380
It’s an ordinary civilian who was killed,

328
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,620
but Commissioner Du,

329
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,740
you came to the wilderness yourself
to deal with the case.

330
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,500
How come you do so?

331
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,380
Commissioner Du, get away quickly.

332
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,540
Your Highness!

333
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,820
Long Aoyi is not an ordinary civilian.

334
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:48,900
Recently,

335
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,220
the gold threads were stolen,
and the Silk Store was on fire.

336
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,340
And today a man was
killed in the wilderness.

337
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,500
Right now, I caught her with the evidence.

338
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,820
And you are also here.

339
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,860
So I must enforce the law impartially

340
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,660
in order to maintain the dignity
of the royal court of Tang.

341
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,780
I’ll never let go of any criminal.

342
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,060
You said you caught her with evidence?

343
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,500
Is there a witness?

344
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:08,980
Well.

345
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,940
The night watchman found

346
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,700
something abnormal here.

347
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,340
I came here immediately
after receiving the report.

348
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,780
Then I found that Vendor Zhou
was dead

349
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,140
with Long Aoyi’s knife in his chest.

350
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,940
No one else was around here.

351
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,740
Even if she is wronged,

352
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,380
we’ll know that after taking
her back for a trial.

353
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,460
Long Aoyi ran away!

354
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,940
Where did she go?

355
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,860
Stop her.

356
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,580
Hindering the government
from handling the case?

357
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,500
Arrest him!

358
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,880
Everyone, go after her.

359
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,740
Right.

360
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,300
= Wuyun Pavilion =

361
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,940
Sir, here you are!

362
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,100
Why do you come so late?

363
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,500
Please go upstairs.

364
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,500
Mr. Zhang.

365
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,740
God!

366
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,260
Come on.

367
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,440
Come upstairs.

368
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,860
Fill the cup.

369
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,660
What good thing did you bring me?

370
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,820
Have fun inside!

371
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,180
Master, there is blood here.

372
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
From now on,

373
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,940
block the whole city.

374
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,500
Search Silver City thoroughly

375
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,620
and even don’t let go of a louse!

376
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,020
We must arrest Long Aoyi,

377
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,780
alive or dead.

378
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,340
Whoever arrests Long Aoyi first,

379
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,980
I’ll ask the Emperor to

380
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,220
make him a military officer
in the seventh rank.

381
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,100
Right.

382
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,130
I’ll come early tomorrow morning.

383
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,660
Sir, come back soon.

384
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,790
Waiting for you!

385
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,380
These days,

386
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,180
a batch of fake goods appeared

387
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,980
among the lower class of Silver City.

388
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,420
Although the price is low,
the materials are of bad quality.

389
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,740
I hope you can work harder

390
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
and let me see the first batch

391
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,860
of finished products in a week.

392
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,580
The material of our pillows
is still improving.

393
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,220
Second Master,

394
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,340
can you give us some extra days?

395
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,740
What do you say?

396
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,060
If the authentic goods do not
come out soon,

397
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,580
the fake ones will prevail in the city.

398
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,220
You don’t know

399
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,300
for this,

400
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,100
I fought with deer for days and nights.

401
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,340
There is another place that
needs to be adjusted.

402
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,300
Goat leather is slippery,

403
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
so you can sew some flannel on this side.

404
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,700
Then people will hardly have a stiff neck.

405
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,780
Well,

406
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,460
can we add something else here?

407
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,540
What stuff?

408
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,900
To relieve the stress
on the cervical spine.

409
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,140
Or just embroider

410
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,700
two rows of ripple patters here?

411
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,740
Then the cervical spine problem
will be solved.

412
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,700
Master Li, you are marvelous.

413
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,420
Qingliu.

414
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,540
Qingliu.

415
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,660
You make the decision.

416
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,060
Just do as you said.

417
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
This morning,

418
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
the supplier of the yarn and leather shops

419
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,820
sent a banquet invitation

420
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,540
saying to recommend you again
as the guild leader.

421
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,300
= For dear Mr. Li to recommend =

422
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
The election of the guild leader

423
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,340
is of great significance

424
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,300
for the future of Xinsilu.

425
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,220
We need to put more efforts to prepare.

426
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,900
These old foxes.

427
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,300
They played a nasty game with us
one after another before.

428
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,300
Now they condescend themselves to beg us!

429
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Okay, I can go to the banquet.

430
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,700
But I want to be the host.

431
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,300
I’ll let them know the rules of Xinsilu.

432
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,860
The content and specifications
of the banquet

433
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,260
is up to you to prepare.

434
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,660
OK.

435
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,540
= Notice =

436
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,100
= Notice =

437
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,220
Long Aoyi is wanted for murder!

438
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,100
Long Aoyi is wanted for murder!

439
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,100
= Notice =
= Criminal Long Aoyi =

440
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,100
Manager Yan.

441
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,020
Manager Yan.

442
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,260
= Xinsilu =

443
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,220
The officials sent this to
every household.

444
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,180
Look.

445
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,780
= Notice =
= Criminal Long Aoyi =

446
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,860
= Murder Stealing of gold threads =

447
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:23,880
Yan Bin,

448
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,620
what are you holding?

449
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,620
Something bad happened.

450
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,180
Master Long is wanted.

451
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,580
= Notice =
= Criminal Long Aoyi =

452
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,180
She killed Vendor Zhou.
There was also evidence.

453
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,660
You are...

454
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,340
The election of new guild leader
is around the corner.

455
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
We shouldn’t bother him

456
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,220
with any trivial thing.

457
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,200
But

458
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,820
The officials have suppressed Xinsilu.

459
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,460
If Qingliu speaks for

460
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,420
a female fugitive now...

461
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,100
Which do you think is important?
The future of Xinsilu,

462
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,500
or a female fugitive?

463
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,020
Yan Bin.

464
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,140
You should be aware

465
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,420
of what is good for your master.

466
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,180
Who painted this picture?
It is really like her!

467
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,100
Look at the mouth. We even don’t need
to look at the face.

468
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,380
This is the den of the suspect.
We have the order.

469
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,420
From now on, Wuyun Pavilion
shall be closed for rectification.

470
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,380
No one shall go out.

471
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,020
Why?

472
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,860
- That’s too much
- How can you do this?

473
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,060
That’s right. Officer,

474
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,980
if my shop is closed,

475
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,740
how can I feed so many people here?

476
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,620
You?

477
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,100
Well,

478
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,540
Yeah.

479
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,340
Since you want to defend
for Long Aoyi,

480
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,740
come back to the government with me.

481
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,460
Long Aoyi is very powerful here.

482
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
She may have many places to hide.

483
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,860
It’s hard to hunt her down
even if we clean up her den.

484
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,180
I don’t think there is a problem
to do this way.

485
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,780
Did Longzhu Gang bother you?

486
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,140
- Send some people to look for her.
- Last spring was extremely cold,

487
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,420
- Longzhu Gang gave you charcoals.
- Hurry up!

488
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
Ungrateful things!

489
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,900
Don’t rubberneck.

490
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,460
Let’s call it a day.

491
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,380
Go. Go.

492
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,300
- What are you doing? So rude.
- Go. Don’t rubberneck.

493
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,140
Let’s call it a day.

494
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,460

495
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,260
= The Book Market =

496
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,460
Please, everyone.

497
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,940
Help find the Master Long.

498
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,740
Thank you.

499
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,140
OK.

500
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,580
Thank you.

501
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,460
- OK.
- Thanks.

502
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,540
Freshly steamed buns with stuffing!

503
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,860
You go that way. I go this way.

504
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,460
- OK. Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

505
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,700
This way.

506
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,340
Go.

507
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,540
= Criminal Long Aoyi =

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,380
The pillows designed by Master Long

509
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,740
are already made.

510
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,100
The more I look at it, the more
complicated I think it is.

511
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,060
Of course.

512
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,980
It is easy to do complicated things,

513
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,420
and it is hard to do simple things.

514
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,020
Actually,

515
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,580
I feel sad when I see the pillow.

516
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,180
When Master Long is not here,

517
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,500
the Silk Store is less lively.

518
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,620
How funny it was when she was here.

519
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,020
She’s like a bird.

520
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Who would say no?

521
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,460
I just went out

522
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,100
and heard that

523
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,980
Master Long is wanted for murdering.

524
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,020
- What?
- What?

525
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,220
Master Long was wanted.

526
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,020
Copies of the order for arrest

527
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,940
are put up all over the city.

528
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,580
How could she be wanted?

529
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,300
I don’t believe that Master Long
would commit murder.

530
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,580
Second Master.

531
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,740
From now on,

532
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,540
no matter publicly or privately,

533
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,460
everyone is forbidden
to talk about Long Aoyi.

534
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,220
Once anyone is found talking,

535
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,100
he or she shall be immediately
expelled from Silk Store.

536
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,740
Right.

537
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,340
Right.

538
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,020
Right.

539
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,300
Manager Yan.

540
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,220
I’ll leave the job to you.

541
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,580
What’s happening?

542
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,580
= Wuyun Pavilion =

543
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,740
How dare you stop the prince?

544
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,580
Your Highness.

545
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,700
Feng.

546
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,620
Your Highness.

547
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,620
Thank you for going with
Second Master yesterday,

548
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,420
or Long

549
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,220
may be in jail now.

550
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,740
Master, you are welcome.

551
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,580
I asked Wu Lin to deliver
the letter last night

552
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,140
because I went overnight

553
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,980
to the official residence of several
important officials in Silver City.

554
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,420
They all pretended to be sick.

555
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,620
Du Changfeng really had a card
up his sleeve.

556
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,140
The order for arrest said that
Miss Long was injured.

557
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
Now pharmacies and herbalists

558
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,740
are all being watched.

559
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,820
How can Miss Long’s
injury be cured?

560
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,860
This old fox!

561
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,820
His power shrouded the Silver City

562
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,220
for a long time.

563
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,020
Your Highness.

564
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,500
I have a favor to ask.

565
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,820
I wonder if Long’s order
for arrest can be revoked first.

566
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,620
The murder can be investigated,

567
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,780
but before they found any problem,

568
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,580
they couldn’t

569
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,620
arrested the person first.

570
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,660
They will listen to me for my sake.

571
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,820
What about it:

572
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,340
I think of a way

573
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,740
to lift everyone from being grounded.

574
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,900
Let’s look for Master Long together.

575
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,260
That’s great!

576
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,820
Thank you, Prince Zhao.

577
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,660
Thank you, Prince Zhao.

578
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,980
Commissioner Du Changfeng is here.

579
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,580
This whorehouse is not
run by the official.

580
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,460
Forgive me for the
inconvenience to step in.

581
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,260
Your Highness, please go out.

582
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,820
I have something to discuss with you.

583
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,060
Hypocritical.

584
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,700
Every time he holds a banquet,

585
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,780
he calls many girls

586
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,980
from here to his house.

587
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,740
Since he is a commissioner
of the third rank,

588
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,180
it’s better for him to
pretend to be lofty.

589
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,860
This old fox has so many spies!

590
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,620
Your Highness.

591
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,820
I wonder who it is.

592
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,620
Commissioner Du, you are so fast.

593
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,420
Please go back to my residence with me.

594
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,020
What if I don’t?

595
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,340
Your Highness, don’t put me on the spot.

596
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,180
Putting you on the spot?

597
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,140
You take so many soldiers

598
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,540
all with weapons.

599
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,060
Commissioner Du, aren’t you
putting me on the spot?

600
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
I dare not.

601
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,380
Du Changfeng,

602
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,620
how dare you threaten the
royal family with weapons!

603
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,900
Our dynasty has been founded
for over two hundred years.

604
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,540
You are not the first.

605
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,780
Forgive me for my disgrace!

606
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,620
They are all here

607
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,080
to protect Your Highness.

608
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,720
They have no intention to rebel.

609
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,740
You also know your own power.

610
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,260
Fine. Do me a favor.

611
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,380
I’ll do my best.

612
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,060
Revoke the order for arrest
of Long Aoyi.

613
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,580
And lift the lockdown here.

614
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,060
This small request

615
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,710
for Commissioner Du,

616
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,910
isn’t so difficult, is it?

617
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,980
I’m afraid I can’t obey your order.

618
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,920
Du Changfeng.

619
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,920
I, as Salt and Iron Officer of Tang,

620
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,080
came to Silver City not to
listen to you,

621
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,720
but to let you listen to me,

622
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,080
as well as the Li family.

623
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,560
You must revoke
the order for arrest today!

624
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,580
Your Highness!

625
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
The sun and the moon can
prove my loyalty!

626
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,780
If Your Highness has something
else to ask me,

627
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,500
I will do it at the risk of my life.

628
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,580
But Long Aoyi’s order for arrest

629
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,700
can’t be revoked.

630
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,860
This isn’t up to you.

631
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,720
Your Highness!

632
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,740
Concubine De sent a letter
this morning,

633
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,610
ordering me to strictly deal with
unruly people in the lower class.

634
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,140
It is them who make trouble such as

635
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,300
stealing, robbing,
kidnapping and cheating.

636
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,380
Therefore, the rations from
officials couldn’t be divided equally.

637
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,950
= To Li Zhao, Prince Zhao =
This is an urgent letter from her.

638
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,220
= Prince Zhao =

639
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,020
You are the prince,

640
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,860
and is supposed to be
diligent in governing.

641
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,460
But according to the
local government,

642
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,820
you are intoxicated into alcohol
and women all day long.

643
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,860
Thanks to Commissioner Du,
he didn’t report it to the Emperor.

644
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,620
I immediately order you to go to
Qimen Temple to make self-reflection

645
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,860
and pray for the Tang royal family
for three days.

646
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,140
Prince Zhao came powerfully,

647
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,980
but after the old fox said a few words,

648
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,780
Prince Zhao went away!

649
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,780
Well,

650
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,660
should we ask Master Li for help?

651
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,340
Silly girl!

652
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,860
Long was driven away by Li.

653
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,140
What should we do then?

654
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,540
Men aren’t reliable.

655
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,260
What men says are nonsense.

656
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,620
Obviously,

657
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,300
I have to deal with it myself.

658
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
We didn’t see her in the
left-side hall,

659
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,700
nor in the right-side hall.

660
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,580
We found a bonfire with heat
in the main hall.

661
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,900
The criminal probably didn’t go far.

662
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,940
Don’t feed water to people
in coma this way.

663
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,580
She will choke when you
pour water in.

664
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,180
Let me do it.

665
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,580
Why is her face so hot?

666
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,220
Hot?

667
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,540
Is it because when we
dragged her here,

668
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,580
she caught a cold?

669
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,780
I saw some officers nearby.

670
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,660
Maybe they came to arrest her.

671
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,300
It’s safe here.

672
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,980
You two go to get more water.

673
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,060
OK.

674
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,100
= Business Suspended =

675
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,980
= Business Suspended =
- Xinsilu is so rich! - Yes.

676
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,300
They made a block booking in Wanhua,
for only one table.

677
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,320
So rich.

678
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,670
Go.

679
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,670
So splendid.

680
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,500
Thank you for your efforts.

681
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,100
I, on behalf of Xinsilu,

682
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,420
make a toast to everyone.

683
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,580
Master Li, distinguished guests,
sorry for keep you waiting.

684
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,490
This is beef stew.

685
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,700
Try it first.

686
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,860
It is a rarity.

687
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,820
The officials don’t allow us to eat it.

688
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,980
But Master Li is here today,

689
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,500
so we can have a chance to eat them.

690
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,520
Here, try it.

691
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,600
Thank you for your praise.

692
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,680
Qingliu said

693
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,240
he must make everyone enjoy his
or her meal.

694
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,280
But Silver City is a small place.

695
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,680
The chef’s skill is limited.

696
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,920
This beef stew

697
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,400
was a little bit overcooked.

698
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,360
Miss Du, you are too polite.

699
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,910
For us, the beef

700
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,280
is already the best in the world.

701
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,480
Yummy! Yummy!

702
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,720
Those who kill horse or oxen for food,
shall be sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.

703
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,560
Grilled yak meat with Cumin.

704
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,040
As businessmen,

705
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,520
they dare to eat beef in public.

706
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,640
Who are the birds of a feather?

707
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
This is braised bamboo shoots.

708
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,560
Ma’am, you are back.

709
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,120
We asked about it specifically.

710
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,840
It’s the favorite food of Master Li.

711
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,600
Sea cucumber with black truffle
and abalone sauce.

712
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,000
Where is the sea cucumber from?

713
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
Slippery and fragrant.

714
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,320
The black truffle

715
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,680
was dug from the deep
mountains of Nanzhao.

716
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
The sea cucumber is rare to see.

717
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,520
It’s really rare to see.

718
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,000
We intended to be the host of
this banquet,

719
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,200
It turns out

720
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,280
Master Li paid a lot for this meal.

721
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,440
It makes us feel ashamed.

722
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,080
There are no less than
100 merchants in Silver City.

723
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,960
The reason we can keep himself rich

724
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,280
in the chaotic situation

725
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,800
is that Silver City

726
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,880
has an environment for
spontaneous and free business.

727
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,680
It is a truth that

728
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,840
every merchant of us understands.

729
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,960
United, we win.

730
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
Deviated, we lose.

731
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,160
Do you agree with me?

732
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,880
What Master Li said is right.

733
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,760
I’ll empty this cup of liquor.

734
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,360
Everyone,

735
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,160
let’s propose a toast to Master Li.

736
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,520
I think no one else is capable,

737
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,880
except for Master Li,

738
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,880
of the guild leader of
the silk business this year.

739
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,440
Here.

740
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,600
Cheers.

741
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
Master Li, please have a look.

742
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,280
This year, our yarn shop
and a leather shop,

743
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
representing all merchants
in the Silver City,

744
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,680
recommend you as

745
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,120
= For dear Mr. Li to recommend =
the guild leader of the silk business.

746
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,600
We have all agreed.

747
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,360
There is only you left.

748
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
Qingliu, sign it.

749
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,420
I heard that an event happened
in Silver City recently.

750
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,200
A female gang leader

751
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,560
killed a vendor.

752
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,680
And she is now wanted.

753
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Mr. Dong, it’s no big deal.

754
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,560
The fight of the ruffians

755
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,760
happen every day.

756
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Let’s first finish

757
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,520
the election of our guild leader.

758
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,320
But

759
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,360
rumors go that this female
gang leader

760
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,760
has no ordinary relationship with
Master Li.

761
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,680
What kind of person is Qingliu?

762
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,440
How can he have something to do
with a fugitive?

763
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,810
Mr. Dong,

764
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,000
you can drink liquor at your will,
but you can’t talk at your will.

765
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Do you mean

766
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,920
that Long Aoyi was wanted?

767
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,000
It is said to be the result of the battles
among the gangs in the lower class.

768
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,000
I remember that I have something
urgent to deal with.

769
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,200
Excuse me for my leaving.

770
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,280
Master Li,

771
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,840
there is only one recommendation.

772
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,720
If you don’t sign it today,

773
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
it won’t count.

774
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,320
Yeah.

775
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,360
Even if you and Master Long
are old acquaintances,

776
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,590
but now that she is wanted,

777
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,320
so no matter how eager you are,
it won’t help.

778
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,400
I’m leaving.

779
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,200
Qingliu.

780
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,000
Master Li.

781
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,900
- Qingliu.
- Master Li.

782
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:46,830
Master.

783
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,240
Why did you also hide it from me?

784
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,680
Why didn’t you tell me?

785
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,240
Master, I...

786
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,080
You, immediately let everyone
in the village

787
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,320
set aside everything he or she is doing,

788
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,400
and use every mean to find Long Aoyi.

789
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,320
Right.

790
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,960
Plus,

791
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,520
don’t disturb the government,

792
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,360
nor begrudge to spend money.

793
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,680
And investigate Vendor Zhou again.

794
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
Master, you mean...

795
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,280
Focus on investigating

796
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,080
the day when the Silk Village
was on fire.

797
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,600
