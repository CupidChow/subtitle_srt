This is Prince Zhao’s Mansion,

36

not some farmer’s market.

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,240
Leave now!

Wu Lin.

43
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,070
Back off!

It’s you.

45
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,350
I need to speak to Prince Zhao.

46
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,480
How did you...

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,710
Do you know where Master is?

48
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,100
I... I don’t.

49
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,540
Please let me see Prince Zhao

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,540
so that I can ask him in person.

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,790
His Highness isn’t home
at the moment.

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,000
Miss,

53
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,030
Master says to keep Long Aoyi’s injury

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,920
and her whereabouts a secret.

55
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,320
They’ve followed us here.

56
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,710
It’s only a matter of time
before Prince Zhao knows.

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,360
What if Prince Jun finds her

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,150
and takes her back?

59
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,280
At this stage,

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,320
Qingliu and I are officially engaged.

61
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,280
Nothing can change that.

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,110
However capable Long Aoyi is,

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,030
she has no chance

64
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,070
to steal my spot.

65
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,400
I don’t care why

66
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,350
she’s staying at a man’s mansion.

67
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,840
Once Qingliu learns of that,

68
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,750
what will he think?

69
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,400
Liar!

70
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,680
If he isn’t inside,

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,120
what’s Du Xiaoxian doing here?

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,280
She...

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Xiaoqin,

74
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,070
please don’t make it hard for me.

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,870
Our mansion

76
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,280
isn’t open to everyone.

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
It’s open to Du Xiaoxian,

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,200
why not me?

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,190
Hold on!

80
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,720
- Xiaoqin. Stop...
- Prince Zhao!

81
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,790
Prince Zhao!

82
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,040
Your Highness.

83
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,400
What brings you to Chang’an?

84
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,280
Why didn’t you give me a heads-up?

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,510
I knew you’re home.

86
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,020
Is my master inside?

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,680
Miss Long?

88
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,650
Shouldn’t she be with you?

89
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,980
I heard from Du Xiaoxian

90
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,590
that she’s in your mansion.

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,790
People in Longzhu Gang

92
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,150
have eyes and ears everywhere.

93
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,680
Yan Bin, Xiaoqin has no manners,

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,310
and neither do you?

95
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,150
I’m here to find my master.

96
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,010
It’s none of your business.

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,620
Enough. Stop.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,190
Miss Du had told me

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,710
about Miss Long’s missing.

100
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,080
But she isn’t here.

101
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,720
You should leave.

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,190
If you

103
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,840
insist on making a scene,

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,080
that’d be

105
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,240
disrespectful to me.

106
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,750
Wu Lin, see them out.

107
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes.

108
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,500
You’d better take your leave.

112
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,670
What brings you here this late,
Brother?

113
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,040
Is it urgent?

114
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,560
I’m sorry for disrupting you.

115
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,440
I’m here

116
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
to ask you for a favor.

117
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,790
If it’s not life-and-death,

118
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,910
just wait till tomorrow at court.

119
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,280
I know Long Aoyi is here.

120
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,720
Let me take one look, then I’ll leave.

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
You came to the wrong place.

122
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,440
She isn’t under my roof.

123
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,230
Save your lies.

124
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,910
I’ve asked around.

125
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,320
The carter said

126
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,880
you took in

127
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,000
an injured girl.

128
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,230
Yes.

129
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,630
A wounded maid,

130
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,830
but not Long Aoyi.

131
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,510
= Prince Zhao’s Mansion =
You’d better leave,

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,790
or things will become ugly.

133
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,040
Besides,

134
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,760
if you have feelings for Long Aoyi,

135
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,360
why did you

136
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,590
get engaged with Du Xiaoxian?

137
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,710
Having one woman isn’t enough,

138
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,270
and you want more?

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,270
Aren’t you a player?

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,630
That’s between Long Aoyi and me.

141
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,360
There’s a misunderstanding.

142
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,680
I’ll explain

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,920
everything to her in person.

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,680
A misunderstanding?

145
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,920
About what exactly?

146
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,160
Let’s say

147
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,070
Long Aoyi is inside,

148
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,160
and you, an engaged man,

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,040
meet her in private,

150
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,870
don’t you know that will

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,950
ruin her and your fiancée’s reputation?

152
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,140
This box of ginseng from the northeast

153
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,750
can help heal the wound.

154
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,920
I have

155
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,070
plenty of that.

156
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
If there’s nothing else,

157
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,370
you should leave. Take care.

How is she, Physician Qin?

160
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,720
Your Highness,

161
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,120
I’m afraid she’s still burning up.

162
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,800
Why isn’t she getting better?

163
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,810
Don’t worry too much.

164
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,720
She’s too weak

165
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
to battle fever.

166
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,120
Physician Qin,

167
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,510
please cure her at all costs.

168
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,070
I will.

You had another fever last night.

173
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,950
Do you feel better?

174
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,560
Your Highness,

175
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,950
obviously, Prince Zhao

176
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,510
intends to keep you from Miss Long.

177
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
You’ve stayed up all night.

178
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,720
Why don’t you go back?

179
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,360
If anything happens here,

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,190
I’ll let you know immediately.

181
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,800
I can’t leave.

182
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,870
Her condition is still unclear.

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,040
I must stay.

184
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,160
Now that her fever is gone,

185
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,070
soon,

186
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,630
she’ll gain full recovery

187
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,830
with enough rest.

188
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,720
Thank you, Physician Qin.

189
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,680
Here’s a little something for you.

190
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,950
Thank you, Your Highness.

191
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,720
Well,

192
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,560
I do have another request.

193
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,720
What is it?

194
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,000
While she was unconscious,

195
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,270
the names she mumbled

196
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,750
meant nothing.

197
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,070
So Physician Qin...

198
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,160
I understand.

199
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
I’m too old

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,270
to remember everything

201
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,600
she said.

202
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,870
That’s good.

203
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
Have a nice day then.

204
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,480
Thanks, Your Highness.

205
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,360
Your Highness, someone came out.

206
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,080
Let me ask him.

207
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,410
Physician Qin,

208
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,960
how’s the patient inside?

209
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,950
Manager Yan.

210
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,830
The patient is fine.

211
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

212
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,750
Skip the formalities.

213
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I just want to know

214
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,080
about the patient’s condition.

215
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,960
She’s stable

216
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,840
and has been out of the coma.

217
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,520
Has she said anything?

218
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
That I don’t know.

219
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,230
Your Highness,

220
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,470
I’m needed elsewhere.

221
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,520
Please excuse me.

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,400
Thank you.

223
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,990
Your Highness, we’re running
out of time.

224
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,070
Don’t be late

225
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,340
for Consort Dowager’s summon.

226
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,230
You should go.

227
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,440
I’ll stake this place out.

228
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,220
Head to the palace.

229
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,920
Seeing you getting better and better,

230
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,400
I’m relieved.

231
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,440
Here in this city,

232
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,160
only you and Second Master
are my friends.

233
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,870
While he was in the palace
and hard to be reached,

234
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,410
it was you who saved my life.

235
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I could never repay you

236
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,280
for that.

237
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,990
Don’t mention it.

238
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,350
I expect nothing in return.

239
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,280
You’re my lifetime friend.

240
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,160
Just a friend?

241
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,350
Sorry, that came out wrong.

242
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
You reminded me of my mentor.

243
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,200
Aoyi,

244
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
soon after you woke up,

245
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,950
you said those who attacked you

246
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,750
killed Feng.

247
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,160
And you mentioned the Buyu Pavilion.

248
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,750
What makes you say that?

249
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,750
Their skills, figures

250
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,160
and voices match those

251
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
of the previous killers.

252
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,160
Still, I couldn’t figure out
their motives.

253
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,070
During my mentor’s stay
at the Wuyun Pavilion,

254
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,350
he could be mean and annoying,

255
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,200
but not so as to be killed.

256
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,710
I’ve made tons of enemies

257
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,870
but few people knew I came here.

258
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,550
Why did you rush to

259
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
the gambling house soon
after you arrived?

260
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,030
That jade concerns the imperial family.

261
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
He can’t know about it.

262
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,030
My hands got itchy,

263
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
so I went there to play.

264
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,390
Once you recover,
we can go there together.

265
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,320
So

266
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,200
what’s your plan next?

267
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,670
I’m here for clues.

268
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,340
But given the situation,

269
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,810
I’m way outnumbered.

270
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,650
Maybe I should ask my men
to come over

271
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,200
to watch my back.

272
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,690
I had sent messages to Silver City

273
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,650
before Xiaoqin was found.

274
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,020
Right now,

275
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,650
they’re probably at the city gate.

276
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,240
Really?

277
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,390
There’s more good news.

278
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,350
I’ve asked Xiaoqin to come here.

279
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,480
Master!

280
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,080
Slowly.

281
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,320
Master! Master!

282
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,630
You look haggard.

283
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,720
There, there, silly.

284
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,630
I’m fine.

285
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,440
You’re bony.

286
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,240
Don’t cry.

287
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,000
Stop!

288
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,600
Officers,

289
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,910
inside is Prince Jun.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
No one is allowed to enter.

291
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,170
Stop!

292
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,750
General Lyu.

293
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,270
Put your swords back.

294
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,480
Yes.

295
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,000
South Court Guarding Commander,
Lyu Chengyun,

296
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,150
pays respects to Prince Jun.

297
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,270
This is a routine check. I apologize

298
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,360
if I offend you, Your Highness.

299
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,200
Where exactly

300
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
are you rushing to?

301
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,030
I’m summoned by Consort Dowager.

302
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,640
Consort Dowager?

303
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
I’m afraid you took the wrong path.

304
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,670
We were unfamiliar with the routes

305
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,790
and wasted too much time
on the wrong turns,

306
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,910
so we took this shortcut

307
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,790
to go to Consort Dowager’s chamber.

308
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,270
I can be of help.

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,150
I know a direct path

310
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,960
that leads to her chamber.

311
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,270
You can follow me.

312
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,390
Appreciated.

313
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,510
Master, that was close.

314
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
You were near death.

315
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,120
Even the physician said

316
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,670
you were in critical condition.

317
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,720
Alright.

318
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,440
You must be tired, too.

319
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,390
Get some rest.

320
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,480
I’d like to take a nap, too.

321
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,030
Go ahead. I’m right here with you.

322
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,670
I was only away for a second

323
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,720
and almost lost you forever.

324
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,320
I won’t leave you ever again.

325
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,480
If you’re with me, what about Yan Bin?

326
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,150
How come you’re still in the mood
to joke?

327
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,480
Alright. I’m sorry.

328
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Finish this before going to bed.

329
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,360
Small! Small!

330
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,320
Big! Big! Big!

331
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,960
Small! Small! Small! Small!

332
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,550
Small!

333
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,170
Small!

334
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,200
Small again!

335
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,720
I wish Miss Long was here.

336
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,120
We haven’t won once,

337
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,120
but kept giving money away.

338
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,910
Be quiet!

339
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,520
Come on.

340
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,320
Small! Small! Small!

341
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,560
Small! Small! Small!

342
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,480
I knew something is wrong.

343
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,630
It’s impossible to lose all the time.

344
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,910
Hey, we don’t cheat.

345
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,980
You’re simply bad at it.

346
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,240
That’s right.

347
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,800
Is that how

348
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,440
you talk to your father?

349
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,070
Eat my fist, you brats!

350
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,240
Stop!

351
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,360
You, that nerd,

352
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,180
come here.

353
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,870
Your Highness.

354
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,070
I got it.

355
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,060
= Gamble =

356
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,910
Who are you? Surnamed what?

357
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,190
The same as you.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
Stop pulling pranks on me,

359
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,330
or I’ll tell Father.

360
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,240
Fine, you won’t get away with it either.

361
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,910
So what are you doing here?

362
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,670
I should ask you that.

363
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,240
Why did you break the rules

364
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
and came to the gambling house
again?

365
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,270
Well...

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,510
you must keep this a secret.

367
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,100
I will

368
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,480
only if you agree

369
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,670
to answer my questions.

370
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,030
Are you bargaining with me?

371
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,120
Fine. Go ahead.

372
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,320
Do you remember Long Aoyi,

373
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,600
the girl

374
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,150
who beat you in the game

375
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,750
a few days back?

376
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,080
She’s cunning.

377
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,380
I remember her.

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,840
She was looking for something.

379
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,720
That was the last time I saw her.

380
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,440
She left here

381
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,480
and almost got killed that day.

382
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,030
She’s been at my place for recovery.

383
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,550
I came today

384
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,510
for information.

385
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,150
Really?

386
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,510
Who wanted her dead?

387
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,120
Desperate gamblers who lost to her?

388
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,270
No way.

389
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I’m telling you,

390
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,550
no one would dare to
stir up trouble at my place.

391
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,750
Are you sure

392
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,200
it had nothing to do with you or your men?

393
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,720
You think so little of me.

394
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,200
Just because I lost

395
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,630
doesn’t mean I wanted her gone.

396
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,320
But wait,

397
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,910
what’s going on between you two?

398
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,440
We’re just friends.

399
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,590
We met in Silver City.

400
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
Just friends?

401
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,640
Is that so? Be honest with me.

402
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,830
Otherwise,

403
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,640
I won’t say any word.

404
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,000
I like her.

405
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,160
Then...

406
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,830
does she like you back?

407
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
Someone else also has a thing for her.

408
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,270
Do you mean Prince Jun?

409
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,720
How did you know?

410
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,830
You two are in love
with the same girl.

411
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,070
She and Li Qingliu

412
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,680
were business partners back
in Silver City,

413
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,750
so they’re close.

414
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,640
But I also have a shot to win.

415
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
Forget about him as he just
got engaged.

416
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,480
You’re a prince,

417
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,550
while she’s a commoner.

418
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,830
Are you aware of the consequence?

419
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,270
The worst case is to get kicked
out of the family.

420
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,640
You’ll be kicked for sure,

421
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,510
but

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
you won’t get out of

423
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,270
the Court of the Imperial Clan
for the rest of your life.

424
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,270
If she circles

425
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,200
between you two,

426
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,960
no one will blame you

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,790
because you’re a prince.

428
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,550
But what about her?

429
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,350
They can easily find an excuse

430
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,680
to get rid of her.

431
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
I’ve thought about that,

432
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,550
but I can’t control my feelings.

433
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,070
At first, I thought she was
special and fun.

434
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,590
But knowing that she got wounded,

435
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,720
I was as painful as her.

436
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,750
Look, if you truly like her,

437
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,310
it’s best to let her go

438
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,440
instead of

439
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,720
getting her into trouble.

440
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,000
Your Highness,

441
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,680
go straight and turn right,

442
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,070
then you’ll see Consort Dowager’s
chamber.

443
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,510
I’m still on duty,

444
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,200
so I can’t escort you further.

445
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,350
Thank you, General.

446
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
By the way,

447
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,240
what’s that heavily guarded place?

448
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,110
It’s off-limits

449
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,440
said by His Majesty.

450
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,350
Empress’s coffin is placed inside.

451
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,790
Guards will stop everyone

452
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,240
passing by that area.

453
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,070
Empress who?

454
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,030
Former Noble Consort Dugu.

455
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,920
Two years ago, after she passed away,

456
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,960
His Majesty conferred the title on her.

457
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,680
His Majesty adored her,

458
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,720
so he kept her coffin in the palace

459
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,640
under tight security.

460
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,480
Oh,

461
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,200
I have another question.

462
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,240
Do you know

463
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,110
my mother had any friends

464
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,920
in the palace before she passed away?

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,830
Actually,

466
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,400
the late empress

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,960
was Concubine Cui’s closest friend.

468
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,180
Good day, Your Highness.

469
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,750
Thank you.

470
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,660
Your Highness,

471
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,410
these are pearls from Persia.

472
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,750
Your Highness, Prince Jun
requests a meeting.

473
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,550
Prince Jun?

474
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,480
My grandson? Go.

475
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,550
Send him in.

476
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,900
My respects to you, Grandmother.

477
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,200
Rise. Get up.

478
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,310
Come here. Come over.

479
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,920
Let me have a closer look.

480
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,350
What a handsome boy!

481
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,270
Just like the younger version
of your father.

482
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,880
You’ve suffered so much
over the years.

483
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,160
Thank you for your concern.

484
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,720
Good boy.

485
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,950
Come here. Sit next to me.

486
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,270
Let me have a good look at you.

487
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,750
And you are...

488
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,390
My name is Xiaoxian.

489
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,440
Yes, right.

490
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,270
She said

491
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,960
your father had betrothed her to you.

492
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,030
Yes, Grandmother.

493
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,480
When he was old enough to marry,

494
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,030
he was reluctant to be with

495
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,200
the woman his father betrothed.

496
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,520
And what now?

497
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,680
He’s following in his father’s footsteps.

498
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,920
If you aren’t happy with
his arrangement,

499
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,720
just let me know.

500
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,830
I’ll take your side.

501
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,070
Xiaoxian is lovely and kind.

502
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,920
I’m sure she’ll be a good wife.

503
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,510
Women in the harem, high and low,

504
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,200
all seem that way.

505
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,450
“Similar to flowers or fog but not,

506
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,820
they arrive at night and disappear
at dawn.”

507
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,590
Is that Shengping?

508
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,990
My respects to you, Grandmother.

509
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,630
Look at you.

510
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,380
You’re a showoff

511
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,110
even after getting married.

512
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,880
I know you hate to be alone.

513
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,830
Here I am with a plant

514
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,570
to perfume the air

515
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,070
in the chamber.

516
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,270
That’s right.

517
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,830
Every time you come,

518
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,240
the whole place will carry

519
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
a pleasant aroma for days.

520
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,830
What is it that you’re carrying?

521
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,220
It’s new in the city,

522
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,080
a Potted Tree.

523
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,270
I came to bring you this

524
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,850
the minute I got it.

525
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,200
I like the name.

526
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,350
Put it over there

527
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,920
so that I can see it every day.

528
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,110
Come here.

529
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,160
Qingliu,

530
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,350
this is your elder sister,

531
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,790
Princess Shengping.

532
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,490
That’s unnecessary.

533
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,440
She’s spoiled,

534
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,480
and a well-known troublemaker
in the palace.

535
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,610
And, of course,

536
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,670
she’s the apple of my eye.

537
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,080
Grandmother, we just met.

538
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,960
You’re making him scared.

539
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,480
You’re a delight.

540
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
I enjoy being around you.

541
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,590
I heard you excelled at
Sichuan Embroidery.

542
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,480
If it’s not too much trouble,

543
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,920
could you make me a dress

544
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,540
of that particular style?

545
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,960
He’s already a prince,

546
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,030
not an embroiderer you can hire.

547
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,920
If you trust my skills,

548
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,270
I can have a try.

549
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,310
Qingliu,

550
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,400
just relax when you talk to me.

551
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,480
Put those trivial formalities

552
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,720
and boring rules behind.

553
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,590
Said so by the troublemaker.

554
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,440
Alright. We’ve had enough fun.

555
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,110
My lunch is too bland

556
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,590
to your taste, so I won’t make you stay.

557
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,880
You may leave.

558
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,830
It’s Xiaoxian.

559
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,220
Xiaoxian.

560
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,790
Qingliu,

561
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,720
I expect you and Xiaoxian

562
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,110
to visit me regularly.

563
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,960
Yes, Grandmother. We will.

564
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,750
Hold on, sister.

565
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,640
What’s wrong?

566
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,720
I’m new here.

567
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,310
Rules in the palace

568
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,240
are strange to me.

569
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,000
I hope you can teach me.

570
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,400
No problem.

571
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,310
I meant to ask you about a few

572
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,400
past events happened in the palace.

573
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,000
I grew up motherless and I miss her,

574
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,270
so I’d like to know more

575
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,720
about her.

576
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,960
I was too young

577
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,030
to remember everything.

578
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,270
And I seldom heard things about her.

579
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:25,680
I see.

580
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
While I was on my way
to Grandmother’s place,

581
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,270
I got lost and almost

582
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,270
broke into
Noble Consort Dugu’s burial hall.

583
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
That was embarrassing.

584
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,840
Well, I was told

585
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,070
she was

586
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,830
my mother’s closest friend.

587
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,400
That’s true.

588
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,550
So I’ve heard.

589
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,880
Father loved her so much.

590
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,640
How come she passed away so young?

591
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,440
I’ll pretend

592
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,350
you didn’t ask me that.

593
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,640
Do not

594
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,960
bring it up to others ever again.

595
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,310
Let bygones be bygones.

596
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,440
Don’t rake up the past easily.

597
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,680
Or both you and others will get hurt.

598
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,000
Understand?

599
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,000
Thanks for telling me.

600
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,380
= North Gate =

601
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,160
- Your Highness.
- How did it go?

602
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,070
Have you got any news

603
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,000
from Prince Zhao’s Mansion?

604
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,160
I was there the entire day

605
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,880
but found nothing from those
coming out.

606
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,890
Let’s go back.

607
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,820
Your Highness,

608
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,540
are you giving up

609
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,170
getting her out?

610
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,540
Right now,

611
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,740
that’s the safest place.

612
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,500
You knew

613
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,340
Prince Zhao has a thing for her.

614
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,020
Back in Silver City,

615
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,370
he was all over her.

616
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,690
If you don’t take action soon,

617
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,020
he might win her over.

618
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,750
Whatever concerns you have,

619
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,370
if I were you,

620
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,410
I’d get her back.

621
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,260
I’m new to the city

622
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,820
without any connections,

623
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,130
and still getting used to

624
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,540
my unexpected title.

625
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
While at court,

626
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,170
everything remains unknown.

627
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,740
I don’t have what it takes

628
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,820
to be with her.

629
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,130
She was already wounded once.

630
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,130
Being with me

631
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,060
would be more dangerous.

632
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,980
At least,

633
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,450
her safety is guaranteed

634
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,300
in Prince Zhao’s Mansion.

635
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,450
What if they get together...

636
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,370
I care more

637
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,170
about her well-being than my feelings.

638
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,500
I understand that.

639
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,450
But still...

640
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,980
You’re up. Hey.

641
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,210
Look what I brought for you to eat.

642
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,260
Pork hock!

643
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,100
Careful.

644
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,450
Aren’t you craving for this
even in your dream?

645
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,930
Try it and see if it tastes the same.

646
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:17,930
I didn’t know

647
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,100
they’d serve this in Chang’an.

648
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,260
Does it taste as good?

649
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,130
More than good.

650
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,690
This hock

651
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,260
takes me back to Silver City.

652
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,980
I bet.

653
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,650
It was cooked according to

654
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,210
the secret recipe of
Kaitai Restaurant there.

655
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,410
That explains it.

656
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,170
My palate is good as new.

657
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,370
Did you invite those chefs over?

658
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,020
Actually,

659
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,170
some of them

660
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,340
are my old acquaintances.

661
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,410
I’d like to have a word with them.

662
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,260
They’ve left.

663
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,450
Without them,

664
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,580
the restaurant can’t open for business.

665
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,020
Then who cooked this?

666
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,130
I did, of course.

667
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,210
I asked them to teach me

668
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,370
so that I could cook it for you.

669
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,450
That way, whenever

670
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,540
you’re craving for home cuisine,

671
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,690
I can satisfy you.

672
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,450
Xiaozhao...

673
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,060
I know you still can’t let go of the past,

674
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,580
but Li Qingliu…

675
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,410
That’s enough!

676
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,540
Li Qingliu and I

677
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,020
are over.

678
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,780
I don’t want to talk about it.

679
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:28,410
I...

680
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,480
Master! Master! Master!

681
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,400
It’s confirmed.

682
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,510
All of them have arrived.

683
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,470
All of them?

684
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,680
Skinny, Gengzi and Fatty.

685
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,990
Where are they?

686
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,270
At Chang’an Inn.

687
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,470
They’ll come and meet us
tomorrow morning.

688
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,980
Did you forget the physician’s advice?

689
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,610
You need bed rest.

690
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,130
Young Master has also come.

691
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,370
He’s brought his men along

692
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:01,980
to help with

693
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,210
our new business in the city.

694
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,370
That’s so thoughtful of him.

695
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,690
Xiaoqin,

696
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,370
bring him some silver

697
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,410
as a thank you gift.

698
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:09,980
Sure.

699
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,610
Come and help me up.

700
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,020
I need to exercise

701
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,930
to recover sooner.

702
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,300
= Xishi Market =

703
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,510
Pendants!

704
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,790
Make it cheaper and I’ll buy it.

705
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,060
Feather dusters!

706
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,400
Sachets and pendants!

707
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,010
Take a look.

708
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:53,530
Not interested.

709
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,620
Is that blondie

710
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,540
from Arabia?

711
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,980
I suppose.

712
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,300
Is that the only foreign country
you know?

713
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,780
Merchants from all neighboring
countries

714
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,820
gather in the city.

715
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,130
Not all of them

716
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,100
are Arabs.

717
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,820
Watch it. Don’t make a fool of yourself.

718
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,980
Fine. Once we find Master,

719
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,370
I’ll sleep for three days and nights

720
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,370
to recover from this exhausting trip.

721
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,050
Check out this mansion.

722
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,060
It’s decorated with gold flakes,

723
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,260
similar to those

724
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,340
of the rich in Silver City.

725
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,260
You ignorant.

726
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
The noble such as Prince Zhao

727
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
never show off their wealth,

728
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,370
unlike those local moneybags.

729
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,210
Don’t touch it.
You can’t afford the repair.

730
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,090
Follow me.

731
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,260
He... He...

732
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,170
What’s that attitude?

733
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,170
Yes. So arrogant.

734
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,230
Stop complaining.

735
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,560
We’re in a prince’s mansion after all.

736
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,260
Let’s go.

737
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,340
It sucks.

738
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,130
Slowly.

739
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,410
Are you alright?

740
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:56,870
Is it hurting again?

741
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,190
Come and have a seat.

742
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,130
Master.

743
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,890
Who are you?

744
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,580
Shouldn’t you greet me on
your knees?

745
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,680
Master.

746
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,030
We heard you were injured.

747
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,500
How are you feeling now?

748
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,450
Master,

749
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,300
you can talk to us in bed.

750
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,550
Yes, that’s right.

751
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,980
Don’t worry. I’m fine. Have a seat.

752
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,210
Let her sit.

753
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,130
I’ve

754
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,540
almost recovered.

755
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,760
Prince Zhao didn’t tell me

756
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,900
about your arrival until earlier.

757
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,780
Now that you’re here,

758
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,980
we need plans to

759
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,890
put down roots here.

760
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,130
Master,

761
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,690
you were attacked soon
after you arrived.

762
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,540
I don’t think

763
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,930
we’re welcome here.

764
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,580
Why don’t we go back?

765
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,500
We’ll all follow you,

766
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,740
and we can join hands with
Master Weng

767
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,740
to lead a comfortable life easily.

768
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,170
Master Long,

769
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,300
before I came,

770
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,260
leader told me

771
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,980
Chang’an and Luoyang

772
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,980
aren’t for outsiders.

773
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,980
If we wish to gain a foothold here,

774
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,340
we have to deal with court officials

775
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,690
and business giants.

776
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,210
Their game

777
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,060
is too complicated

778
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,620
for us to play.

779
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,740
I agree. First, it was Feng,

780
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,690
and then you.

781
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,340
Clearly, someone is
seeing us as an eyesore,

782
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,910
all of us.

783
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,950
As long as the mastermind
is still out there,

784
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,580
there isn’t a safe place

785
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,890
for us to settle down.

786
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,310
Rest assured.

787
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,060
I’ll avenge my mentor’s murder,

788
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,980
but not now.

789
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,450
I’ve decided to stay here for a while.

790
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,740
Is the murderer hiding in Chang’an?

791
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,720
What do you think?

792
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,450
We’ve never left Silver City before.

793
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,030
Who would want us dead?

794
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,240
While we try to find the killer,

795
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,650
we can’t hole up in the dark

796
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,130
like rats.

797
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,610
You know the saying

798
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,890
to hit someone when he’s down.

799
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,100
We must prove that we have
nothing to fear

800
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,410
before capturing the assailant.

801
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,690
Well put!

802
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,820
I love your tenacity.

803
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,890
Prince Zhao.

804
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,540
Prince Zhao.

805
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,410
Make yourselves at home.

806
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,210
You can sit back.

807
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,020
Your Highness,

808
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,100
we left in haste

809
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,130
for this long journey

810
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,890
and only brought with us
liquor made this year.

811
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,020
Thank you.

812
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,620
You know,

813
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,100
liquor I had here isn’t strong enough.

814
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,720
That’s true.

815
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,060
What I had in Silver City is my favorite.

816
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,130
It’d be perfect

817
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,260
to drink it with pork hock
and roasted chicken.

818
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
Sadly, Feng...

819
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,730
I lost someone to drink with.

820
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,940
But I promise you

821
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,170
I’ll work with you

822
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,580
to find the killer.

823
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,690
By the way,

824
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,380
Prince Zhao has recommended

825
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,540
a few stores for rent.

826
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,020
You can check them out.

827
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,580
It’s time to rebuild our business.

828
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,250
Tell me which one you prefer.

829
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,060
I’ll pay the rent.

830
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,250
I can’t let you do that.

831
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,290
We have enough money.

832
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,330
Even if we don’t,

833
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,690
we cannot

834
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,100
take advantage of you.

835
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,250
I’m willing

836
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
to help you as much as I can.

837
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
What about Master Li?

838
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,540
From now on,

839
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,170
he and I

840
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,610
will be on separate paths.

841
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,460
= Tianxian Restaurant =

842
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
Your Highness, are you saying

843
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,860
Master Long was attacked

844
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,860
after arriving in the city?

845
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,290
I don’t know about the details.

846
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,980
That’s why I hope

847
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,330
you can fill me in.

848
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,770
Such as

849
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,650
conflicts between local gangs.

850
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,980
Not that I’ve heard of.

851
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,370
Because of the long-standing curfew,

852
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,290
criminal cases are few.

853
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,040
I didn’t receive

854
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,360
any tip-off lately.

855
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,290
It’s my fault.

856
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,290
Master Long did come to me

857
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,610
but I didn’t pay attention

858
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,540
and failed to protect her.

859
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,130
It’s not your fault.

860
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,330
If it’s not the gangs,

861
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,020
who would target her?

862
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,060
You can count on me.

863
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,690
I’ll get to the bottom of it.

864
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,460
How is she now?

865
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,900
She’s resting at Prince Zhao’s Mansion.

866
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,900
Prince Zhao’s?

867
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,100
I... I mean

868
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,860
Aren’t you two...

869
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,100
That mansion is heavily guarded.

870
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,250
And I already got engaged.

871
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,900
It’s better for her

872
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,170
to stay there for now.

873
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,820
= Dongshi Market =

874
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
Who the hell are you?

875
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,900
We... we need to buy something.

876
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,500
No, we simply passed by.

877
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,420
Hello, gentlemen.

878
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,060
You can go in.

879
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,850
Go ahead.

880
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,060
Just go!

881
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,980
How can I help you?

882
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,540
We’re opening tomorrow

883
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,380
with special offers.

884
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,420
Can I interest you in anything?

885
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,500
No, thanks. That won’t be necessary.

886
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,510
Well,

887
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,210
a Miss Long told me

888
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,570
this store supplies cheap ingredients,

889
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,580
so we came to have a look.

890
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,500
Yes.

891
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,690
That’s right.

892
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,260
Fatty, take our guests

893
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,550
to warehouse No.2

894
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,010
to check the stocks.

895
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,290
Let’s go.

896
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,860
Go ahead.

897
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,060
Go with him.

898
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,010
Go.

899
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,200
Sir,

900
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,100
have a seat.

901
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:53,880
Please.

902
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,030
I’m needed in the store,

903
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,390
so I shall take my leave.

904
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,980
Hold your horses.

905
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,610
Master has asked us

906
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,480
to take good care of you.

907
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,900
It’s true

908
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,020
they’re ingredients from the south

909
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,470
in full amount.

910
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,100
Yes.

911
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,680
And the price is lower than
half the cost on the market.

912
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,770
Many thanks to Master Long.

913
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,990
- That’s so generous of her.
- Thank you.

914
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,100
