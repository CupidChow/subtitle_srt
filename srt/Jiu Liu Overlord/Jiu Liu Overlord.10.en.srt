32
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,860
Do you know why I want to
talk to you alone?

33
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,260
What’s he up to?

34
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,420
Naughty.

35
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,780
You asked me to come with you alone.

36
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,100
There are just you and me here.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,540
What if they gossip about us?

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,660
Sir,

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,620
do you need me to give you a massage

40
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,780
to help you relax?

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,020
Be serious with me.

42
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,780
You think I don’t know you?

43
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,660
First, I’ll boil a cauldron of water

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,060
to remove your hairs with it

45
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,900
and make you glabrous like a roast sheep.

46
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,700
And then I’ll rub your skin

47
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,540
with well salt

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,540
to squeeze your blood

49
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,460
all out.

50
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,260
And then…

51
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,780
Do you normally wear a corset?

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,100
I believe you do.

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,300
You are always running around.

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,460
Your corset must not be tight enough.

55
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,460
You know clearly

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,580
what would happen after a long day

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,740
if you didn’t use lacing.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,780
You…

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,580
You are really…

60
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,340
What do they call it?

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,900
A true pervert.

62
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Like you just said,

63
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,700
underclothes should be comfortable.

64
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,700
There are no pleats at the breast part.

65
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,060
No cutting allowance.

66
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,420
The waist part is too tight.

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,180
It might tear when you
do strenuous exercise.

68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,820
The lacing is at about
the fourth thoracic vertebra.

69
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,140
It’s hard to tie it all by oneself.

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,980
Do I need to continue?

71
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,180
How do you know about
the thoracic vertebra?

72
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,740
The seams are all
at abdomen and rib parts.

73
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
However soft the stitch is,
your skin can still feel it.

74
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,020
And the clipping

75
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,180
is too rough.

76
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,100
You ruined the texture of the cloth.

77
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,900
How do you know so much?

78
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,620
Now that you want it to be comfortable.

79
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,060
Go alter it.

80
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,660
Master!

81
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,260
Master.

82
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,500
Some people came to the store

83
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,620
to place an order of 100 sets of

84
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,940
underclothes Master Long altered.

85
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,900
Look! What did I say?

86
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,740
I said there would be an order of 100.

87
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,500
Tell the ones who have bought it

88
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,980
that they’ll get a discount
for our new product.

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,740
And reject all new orders.

90
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,300
Reject them?

91
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,020
But they are already here.

92
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,780
What’s your problem?
You are rejecting money!

93
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
You unscrupulous merchant!

94
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,900
Do you want to adopt hunger marketing

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,180
and make it rise in price?

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,260
Not even a single flawed product

97
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,140
can be released to market from Xinsilu.

98
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,940
My Lady,

99
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,940
Master Li will definitely like

100
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,740
the soup you made for him.

101
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,820
Xiaoxian.

102
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,660
Father.

103
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,820
Xiaoxian.

104
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,180
I’ve been looking for you all morning.

105
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,140
Where are you going?

106
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
I went to buy something.

107
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
And I’m going to the silk manor now.

108
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,900
I have planned your day for you.

109
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,500
His Highness wants to enjoy a diversion
outside the city.

110
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,020
Today,

111
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,300
you’ll go to the southern suburbs
with him.

112
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,660
But I…

113
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,380
That’s it.

114
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,220
Go back to pick up His Highness now.

115
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,620
= Warehouse =

116
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,020
Aoyi,

117
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,220
you’ve been staring at that.

118
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,420
What’s wrong with it?

119
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,220
Auntie,

120
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,540
that weird son of yours,

121
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,460
he pointed out many problems of my design.

122
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,900
I have solved most of them.

123
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,180
But at the breast part,

124
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,100
what kind of material is

125
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,540
tough enough to provide support,

126
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,140
but also soft enough for the skin.

127
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,860
I tried many kinds
but no one is good enough.

128
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,900
Girl,

129
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,700
what do you want that for?

130
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,740
You are studying that?

131
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,220
Don’t you feel bashful?

132
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,620
Look at you.

133
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,140
I told you

134
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,580
but now you are making fun of me.

135
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,100
Do you have an idea about this?

136
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,780
In the backyard…

137
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,260
Yes!

138
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:50,980
Go.

139
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,340
I’m going now.

140
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,020
Can I borrow two feathers?

141
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,860
Please be nice.

142
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,260
Can I borrow two feathers from you?

143
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,500
Don’t run!

144
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,620
Just two feathers.

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,740
Don’t be so stingy!

146
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,140
Only two, OK?

147
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,740
Stop running!

148
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,420
Stop it!

149
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,100
Here.

150
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,060
I caught you.

151
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,860
I’ll take two feathers.

152
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,260
Don't move.

153
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,540
What’s that?

154
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,900
It flew away.

155
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,420
So annoying!

156
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,620
You know what?

157
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,940
In front of us

158
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,580
is the most beautiful lake
in suburb of Silver City.

159
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,060
I know, the Phoenix Lake.

160
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,820
Do you have something on mind, Miss Du?

161
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,060
Lately,

162
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,140
I’ve been busy with
the affairs of the silk manor.

163
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,340
Please pardon me.

164
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,100
I heard that
after the countinghouse was sealed,

165
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,340
you’ve made a new product

166
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,780
out of the materials in stock.

167
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,460
And it sells well in Silver City.

168
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,420
Please don’t mention that.

169
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,660
That kind of indecent clothes

170
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,180
can only harm Xinsilu’s reputation.

171
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,460
Miss Du,

172
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,460
do you have some prejudice over Miss Long?

173
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,260
I don’t understand
the world she came from.

174
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,940
With that kind of indecent idea,

175
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,940
she’s ruining us.

176
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
As far as I know,

177
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Miss Long is helping Xinsilu

178
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,020
get through this

179
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,100
without asking for anything.

180
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,340
Please don’t misunderstand

181
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,020
Miss Long’s good intention.

182
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,940
Everybody in this world pursues interests.

183
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,380
Your Highness shouldn’t just
take things at face value.

184
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,180
Let me try it.

185
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,660
Where did she go?

186
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,500
= Big Rat =

187
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,300
= Big Human =
= Du Xiaoxian =

188
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,260
= Zhaonan =

189
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,140
A girl falling in love.

190
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,340
Auntie, you are back.

191
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,620
Your idea is really good!

192
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,060
Feather stalks are resilient and smooth.

193
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,660
They can hold them well.

194
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,060
That weird son of yours

195
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,380
sure has some ideas.

196
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,100
Auntie?

197
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,060
Bamboo shoots?

198
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,740
How come it got worse?

199
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Let’s play stone skipping.

200
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,580
The lake is vase and so is the sky.

201
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,260
Over the mountain across the lake,

202
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
there’s smoke from kitchen chimneys.

203
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,860
It seems to be a village.

204
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,300
This is such a fictitious land of peace.

205
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,700
That’s Hejia Village.

206
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,780
There are 1,000 mu of mulberry trees.

207
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,500
The villagers there
all live on silkworm breeding.

208
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,980
Miss Du,

209
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,820
you seem to be familiar with this place.

210
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,940
Five years ago,

211
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,140
when we were preparing
to build the silk manor,

212
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,860
we came here a lot.

213
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,340
We planted mulberry trees,
collected cocoons and reeled for silk.

214
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,100
Spring silkworms, Summer silkworms,

215
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,340
and then late Autumn silkworms.

216
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,300
Three harvests a year.

217
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,300
Our footprints

218
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,900
covered this place all up.

219
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,980
We were young

220
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
and ambitious then.

221
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,140
We dreamed to do something great
in the silk industry.

222
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
How was that?

223
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,740
Now our dream has come true.

224
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,580
But we are actually drifting apart.

225
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,140
To have a beautiful girl like you

226
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,340
care for him,

227
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,420
Master Li should feel blessed.

228
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,580
But eventually,

229
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,020
my infatuation was

230
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,500
all in vain.

231
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,860
It went so far!

232
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,980
How was that?

233
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,540
What about you?

234
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,740
So many fair young ladies

235
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,220
are admiring you

236
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,980
in Chang’an City.

237
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,460
But why do you have to

238
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,220
like a rough girl?

239
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,820
Miss Long.

240
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,060
It’s the first time

241
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,620
I met such a girl.

242
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,980
She’s not so old-fashioned as those girls

243
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,180
from noble families.

244
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,260
She’s innocent, free,
romantic and carefree.

245
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,020
A thing is valued if it is rare.

246
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,380
It’s natural for her

247
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,060
to attract my attention.

248
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,700
That’s not all.

249
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,140
Miss Long is not like you and me,

250
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,700
who were born with

251
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,020
chains binding on us.

252
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,300
I love Qingliu

253
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,420
because he’s leading a life I dream of.

254
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,340
But I am just a pawn to my father.

255
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,180
So,

256
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,300
your feelings toward Miss Long

257
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,580
is your way of breaking free
from those chains.

258
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,620
You are right, but only half right.

259
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,860
Being born in imperial family
means there’s no freedom.

260
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,260
I hated the restraint from my mother

261
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,780
since I was little.

262
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,380
I would not hesitate to hurt myself

263
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,140
to challenge her bottom line.

264
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,140
But in the end,

265
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,540
I found that the restraint

266
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,940
would become

267
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
tighter and tighter

268
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,900
as I struggle.

269
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,220
But then I met Miss Long.

270
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,700
She showed me

271
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,100
what a free life should be like.

272
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,460
Actually, she’s not my way

273
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,340
to break free from those chains.

274
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,860
She’s my key to those chains.

275
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Try it again.

276
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,380
OK, I’ll try again.

277
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,060
Why can’t I do it?

278
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,740
I’ll teach you.

279
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,260
Master, you asked for me?

280
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,900
Master Long asked me to send this to you.

281
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,580
You were not here,

282
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,780
so I put it on your table.

283
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Why didn’t she send it herself?

284
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,260
I don’t know.

285
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,180
She called many people to the backyard.

286
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,420
They are wandering around now.

287
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,300
She said,

288
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,940
“it’s gonna rain bamboo shoots.”

289
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,900
Bamboo shoots?

290
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,700
Master, you are having a blush.

291
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,900
Give out orders.

292
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,300
Let them carefully measure this model,

293
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,780
and make samples of different sizes.

294
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,940
Workshops should produce at full speed.

295
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,220
But this…

296
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,460
Just go.

297
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,780
How many?

298
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,260
1,000.

299
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,580
Yes.

300
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,220
Bamboo shoots.

301
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,700
Miss Du,

302
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,220
thank you for your company.

303
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,420
It’s getting late. You should go back now.

304
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Your Highness, we…

305
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,820
Aren’t you going back with us?

306
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,660
Wu Lin and I still have something to do.

307
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,780
But…

308
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,540
I’ll tell Mr. Du about this.

309
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,300
Thank you again.

310
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,060
OK.

311
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,780
We are finally rid of her.

312
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,060
What are you staring at?

313
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,500
There are some fruit trees in front of us.

314
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,500
Let’s go pick some fruits for Miss Long.

315
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:56,980
OK.

316
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,380
Let’s go.

317
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,780
Be careful, Your Highness.

318
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:09,860
Here.

319
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,060
Careful, Your Highness.

320
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,180
Careful.

321
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,380
Here.

322
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,980
That one is so high.

323
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,700
It must be very sweet.

324
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,060
Your Highness, be careful.

325
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,540
Your Highness, you’ve picked so many.

326
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,340
Let’s go wash them.

327
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,780
OK.

328
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,580
The mangosteens here are so big.

329
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,740
Your Highness.

330
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,660
What’s so special about this Long Aoyi?

331
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,980
Is she worth you picking mangosteens

332
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,260
and washing them for her?

333
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,220
Wu Lin,

334
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,620
how many years have you been by my side?

335
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,580
Over ten years.

336
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,740
Over ten years
but you still don’t know me.

337
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,900
I never lacked beautiful girls by my side,

338
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,620
but they all have

339
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,900
their own purposes.

340
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,060
Some just desire wealth,

341
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,740
and some want to
form political marriage with me.

342
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,220
I always try my best to avoid them.

343
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,420
For this trip to Silver City,

344
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,300
other than official business,

345
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,060
I’m also here to enjoy a diversion.

346
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,220
And then I met Miss Long.

347
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,020
She’s different from

348
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,740
all girls I’ve ever met.

349
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,540
I hope I can be with her forever.

350
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,860
Washing some mangosteens for her
is nothing.

351
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,820
I don’t really understand this.

352
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,060
That’s because you have not
met your true love yet.

353
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,260
How about I introduce you someone?

354
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,740
No need, Your Highness.

355
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
What do you think about Yue’er?

356
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,380
I saw you flirting with her

357
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,300
on the way here

358
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,820
and you both seemed happy.

359
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,700
I didn’t. I just think she’s cute.

360
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,820
Then, how about Xiaoqin?

361
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,020
Although she’s not really

362
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
a fair lady,

363
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,620
she’s kind-hearted.

364
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,660
She’s not my type.

365
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,980
You are pretty ambitious.

366
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,860
Don’t tell me

367
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,460
you have feelings for Miss Du.

368
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,860
I wouldn’t dare, Your Highness.

369
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,780
Nothing is impossible though.

370
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,060
Should I help you with that?

371
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,180
Your Highness, I…

372
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,820
Your Highness, I can’t swim!

373
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,020
Oh, it’s not deep.

374
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,340
You can’t swim?

375
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,020
You can’t swim? You can’t swim?

376
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,580
There’s a snake behind you.

377
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,900
A snake! Be careful!

378
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,620
No! No!

379
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,980
- Such a long snake!
- I hate snakes! I hate snakes!

380
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,420
Come on, come up!

381
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,180
Here, try it.

382
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,020
Your Highness,
when do you plan to go back?

383
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,140
It’s already night.

384
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,660
I say

385
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,420
we stay here for the night.

386
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,740
I mean to Chang’an.

387
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,980
You can’t stay here

388
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,380
forever, you know.

389
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,740
The pepper case is still a mess.

390
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
What should I say

391
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,100
if I went back now?

392
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,020
But you are the Salt and Iron officer.

393
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,140
As long as we report
the information we’ve got

394
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,140
to the imperial court,

395
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,220
they will naturally send people
to solve this.

396
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,140
What are you talking about?

397
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,660
I’m a prince of Tang

398
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,940
and I’m in an important position.

399
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,060
I’m in duty bound

400
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,180
to anything that’s related

401
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,500
to the country and the people.

402
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,380
Your Highness, I think

403
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,860
you have changed.

404
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Maybe it’s because

405
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,340
I like the food
here in Silver City too much.

406
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,700
What? Don’t you think

407
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,540
it’s more free here.

408
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,180
Sometimes

409
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,980
I wish I could give up everything

410
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,340
and be a farmer here.

411
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,140
I could till my land

412
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,700
every day.

413
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,340
And in stack seasons,

414
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,060
I could travel everywhere

415
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,860
to enjoy the views. Isn’t that good?

416
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,260
If you were a farmer,

417
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,500
you would die of hunger.

418
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,780
How about this?

419
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,420
I can also stay and be your neighbor.

420
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,500
Why neighbor?

421
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
This is not Chang’an.

422
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,380
We can be brothers.

423
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,100
OK.

424
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,700
Farther has many sons,

425
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,540
but since I can remember things,

426
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
I was always lonely.

427
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,500
I envied the kids

428
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,460
of ordinary families the most

429
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,940
for their brotherhood.

430
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,100
But since you came into
the imperial palace,

431
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,020
we rode horses and shot together,

432
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,140
we studied
and learned martial arts together.

433
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,060
You are not only a company

434
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,380
but more like

435
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,900
a brother to me.

436
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,460
So, in the next life,

437
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,620
if it’s possible,

438
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,540
let’s be brothers.

439
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,500
It’s getting cold, eat up.

440
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,540
OK.

441
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,860
How is it?

442
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,740
Nice! Nice!

443
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,060
But not salty enough.

444
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,380
Just eat it!

445
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,220
I roasted it for you! Finish it!

446
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,860
You just talked about brotherhood,
but now…

447
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,020
= Du’s Mansion =

448
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,140
The missing gold thread
has been found by him.

449
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
And for the government investment

450
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,860
and countinghouse,

451
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,700
he also found solutions.

452
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,420
I failed to fulfill my task.

453
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,980
That little Li Qingliu

454
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,620
got the only customs seal

455
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,060
the Fabric Bureau issued

456
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,820
in last five years.

457
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,980
With that,

458
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,820
he has got the access to foreign trade.

459
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,100
There’s such a good stuff
but it’s not mine,

460
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,100
how can I sleep well at night?

461
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,620
This time,

462
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,660
I’ll ruin the whole silk manor

463
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,780
and force him to hand it out.

464
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:02,940
Remember,

465
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,180
don’t disappoint me again.

466
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,100
Yes.

467
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,100
Go now!

468
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,020
You failed to fulfill
all former tasks I gave you.

469
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,180
There is a chance

470
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,060
for you to make up for that,
you understand?

471
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,620
Yes, yes, I understand.

472
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,180
Remember, this is the last chance.

473
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Yes, thank you, Sir!

474
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,420
I got it.

475
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,220
I’ll do as you said.

476
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,660

the preparation is almost done.

If you can’t fulfill this task well,

483

I’ll find another place for this needle.

484

Please rest assured.

Why do you smell funny?

What smell?

496
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,660
Maybe I touched some oil

- Qingliu!
- My Lady!

514
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,420
Master!

515
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,140
Qingliu!

516
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,900
What should we do?

517
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,100
- Long Aoyi! Long Aoyi!
- Master!

518
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,940
Wake up!

519
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,180
Fire!

520
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,300
The silk manor is on fire!

521
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,500
The silk manor is on fire!

522
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,980
The silk manor is on fire!

523
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,100
Wake up!

524
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,980
The bellybands.

525
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:32,670
Come on.

526
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,740
Let’s go.

527
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,740
Qingliu, come out!

528
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,660
Manager Yan, where’s Miss Long?

529
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,380
We looked everywhere but didn’t find them.

530
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,260
You looked everywhere?

531
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,180
Everywhere.

532
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,220
Master!

533
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,570
Run!

534
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,860
Your Highness!

535
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,380
- Your Highness, you can’t. Your Highness.
- No, it’s too dangerous, you can’t go.

536
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,340
Nonsense!

537
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,540
If you don’t let me go, you go ahead!

538
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,580
There’s a person in there!

539
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,300
Mr. Du! I order you
to send people in to save them!

540
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,820
County Magistrate, I’ll punish you
if this causes death.

541
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,700
Wu Lin, let’s go save them

542
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,420
before it’s too late.

543
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:21,860
Yes!

544
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,460
Let’s go!

545
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,380
Your Highness!

546
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,500
I don’t think there’re people inside.

547
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,980
Even if there were,
they wouldn’t survive for sure.

548
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,420
= Warehouse =

549
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:38,980
Let’s go.

550
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,780
= Warehouse =

551
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,740
They are out!

552
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,460
Qingliu!

553
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,990
Master!

554
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,110
Qingliu!

555
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,420
- Aoyi, are you OK?
- Qingliu, are you all right?

556
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,140
Are you OK?

557
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,540
Aoyi.

558
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,220
Are you hurt?

559
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,660
Aoyi!

560
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,380
How is she?

561
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,860
You are finally out.

562
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,070
It’s so dangerous.

563
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,500
Your Highness.

564
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,540
How do you feel?

565
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,380
- Master, be careful.
- Master. Master.

566
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,500
Qingliu, are you OK? I’ll call the doctor.

567
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,460
I’m OK.

568
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,220
The first priority is to put out the fire.

569
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,900
Evacuate people to safe places.

570
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,380
You sure you are OK?

571
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,060
OK, take care.

572
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,660
All the servants, go put out the fire!

573
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,540
The others, come with me.

574
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,500
OK. Let’s go!

575
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,720
Let’s put it out! Come on!

576
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,420
Hurry!

577
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,900
Father! The fire!

578
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,100
What are you waiting for! Help put it out!

579
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,220
Yes!

580
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,380
Wake up, Aoyi.

581
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,700
Oh, no.

582
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,620
Wu Lin, go get some water.

583
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,220
Yes!

584
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,820
Aoyi!

585
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,180
Aoyi.

586
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:02,900
Aoyi.

587
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,580
Do you feel better?

588
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,620
It’s OK. I can do this myself.

589
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,540
Your hand is burnt.

590
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,100
It’s OK.

591
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,900
Over these years,

592
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,620
why do you think

593
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,420
the whole Longzhu Gang is following me?

594
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,540
This is nothing.

595
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,940
It’s a miracle for you

596
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,220
to survive so many years.

597
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,140
Are you better?

598
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,420
Yeah.

599
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,260
You are awake.

600
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,380
Come on.

601
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,940
Does your hand still hurt?

602
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
You know the pain now.

603
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,340
A girl shouldn’t try to be a hero.

604
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,700
Why do you have to save those bellybands?

605
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,620
We are counting on them to make money.

606
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,620
You wrapped this for me?

607
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,900
What do you think?

608
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,460
It needs to be changed later.

609
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,700
Thank you.

610
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,300
Well,

611
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,100
thank you for saving me last night.

612
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,500
You know what?

613
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,300
You nearly delivered a crushing blow
to the silk manor.

614
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,380
I delivered it?

615
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,900
Xiaoxian.

616
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,900
How much would we have lost
if the whole manor

617
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,100
had been burn down?

618
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,500
In case of no casualties.

619
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,860
According to the items in stock
in the warehouse,

620
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,900
the finished cost

621
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,100
and unfinished cost of them…

622
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,980
Would have been

623
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,700
632,745 taels.

624
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,340
What if it had caused one death?

625
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,780
According to the lump sum
casualty allowance standard,

626
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,340
it would have been 30 times

627
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,500
the taxes our country collected
in the first half year…

628
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
Which is

629
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,940
985,990 taels.

630
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,220
That means

631
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,140
you would have caused more loss to me

632
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,300
than the loss of the whole manor.

633
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,140
So, you don’t need to thank me.

634
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,420
Thank yourself for
not being a bolt of cloth.

635
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,780
That’s too much!

636
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,620
Not only are you arrogant,

637
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,420
you are also stingy and cold-blooded!

638
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,420
How could you compare a life with money?

639
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,100
What kind of parents could have

640
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,500
given birth to such a weirdo like you?

641
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,700
You…

642
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:39,900
Aoyi.

643
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,780
Qingliu, you got hurt.

644
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,620
It’s OK. Nothing serious.

645
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,740
How is that not serious?
I’ll call the doctor.

646
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,100
No need. I’ll wrap it up.

647
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,100
I’ll help you with it.

648
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,420
The fire was so fierce,

649
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,900
did you go in to save…

650
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,580
No,

651
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,780
I hurt myself when I was

652
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,140
putting out the fire.

653
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,820
Master Li.

654
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,700
Say it.

655
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,580
The damage is not too big.
Only three houses are burnt.

656
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,660
But,

657
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,580
there are two origins

658
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
for last night’s fire.

659
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,460
One is in Master Long’s yard,

660
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,860
the other is in the warehouse.

661
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,740
We can almost be sure that

662
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,820
the one set the fire
wanted Master Long dead.

663
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,060
= Xinsilu =
- Let me in. - I can’t.

664
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,900
= Xinsilu =

665
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,340
You can’t.

666
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,100
You can’t get in.

667
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,220
- Just let me in, let me in!
- What’s going on?

668
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,620
Manager Yan.

669
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,500
You may leave.

670
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:01,980
Yes.

671
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,780
You are right on time.

672
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,420
Let me in, I want to see our Chief.

673
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,420
She just got a minor wound on her hand.

674
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
She’s hurt? Step aside.

675
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,540
You…

676
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,540
I’m sorry. I…

677
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
I don’t believe it!

678
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
I’ll get in no matter what!

679
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,100
I dare you touch me again!

680
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,460
- I dare you! I dare you!
- No, please.

681
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,340
I… I won’t touch you.

682
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,660
But they are in there
investigating the case now.

683
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,660
= Xinsilu =
You’d cause some misunderstanding if you get in,

684
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,500
and that would do no good to Master Long.

685
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,420
Believe me, once there’s a chance,

686
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,660
I’ll definitely let you in.

687
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,060
Really?

688
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,940
If I lie to you,

689
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,260
let me… let me end up with no wife.

690
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,820
Deal.

691
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,860
You know what?

692
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,940
I found a book days ago

693
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,980
which is full of the love letters

694
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,780
from those concubines out of favor
to the emperor.

695
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,540
In this critical time,

696
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,620
you are also thinking about books!

697
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,900
I warn you,

698
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,460
if I can’t meet our Chief in a few days,

699
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:44,820
I’ll…

700
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,740
When you have time,

701
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,980
come for me with your books.

702
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,860
You didn’t leave any evidence, did you?

703
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,100
Don’t worry, Master Qiyan.

704
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,300
Let alone those officials,

705
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,620
even if the Buddha were there,

706
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,020
he would find nothing.

707
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,820
How about the person
I ordered you to kill?

708
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,300
I don’t know that.

709
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,700
I hit her, and she...

710
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,260
She…

711
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,740
= Loyalty as High as the Sky =
But as far as I know,

712
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,980
she’s safe and sound other than

713
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,620
some minor wound on her hand.

714
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,860
But… But… That’s not my fault.

715
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,980
She was too lucky.

716
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,020
Not your fault?

717
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,860
So is it my fault?

718
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,460
Is it?

719
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:42,860
My fault?

720
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,740
No, Master Qiyan, look,

721
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,980
I set fire on the silk manor.

722
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,820
You don’t understand
what Master Qiyan said?

723
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,860
You didn’t kill Long Aoyi,

724
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,420
so what even if you burnt
the whole Silver City down!

725
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,620
Master Qiyan,

726
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
I cannot control fire.

727
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,940
Whether the fire kills her or not

728
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,540
is not up to me.

729
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,100
Who was the one

730
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,100
that promised Master Qiyan the success?

731
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,700
Master Qiyan,
please give me another chance.

732
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,420
I’ll kill her for sure!

733
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:20,940
Get out now!

734
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,420
Give me another chance, Master Qiyan!

735
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,140
Master Qiyan! Master Qiyan!

736
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,380
Get lost!

737
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,140
Master Qiyan! Give me another chance!

738
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:26,740
Master Qiyan!

739
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,060
Move!

740
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,700
But Master,

741
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,140
how did you know about

742
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,060
Long Aoyi’s wound?

743
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,740
Does that mean

744
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,260
there’s one of us in the government?
