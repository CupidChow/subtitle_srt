32
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,560
Master,

33
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,860
you turned an orphan

34
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,970
into a gang master.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
Who else is beside me

36
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,650
when you are gone?

37
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,430
Master!

38
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,750
Master!

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,430
Long,

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,510
it is really you!

41
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,430
I didn’t expect to see you here.

42
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,480
Zhao,

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,480
come here.

44
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:38,870
Master!

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
Master!

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Leave me alone!

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,680
Come on, take a seat.

48
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,150
Take a seat, please.

49
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,840
I am okay.

50
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
Take care!

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,560
Liquor!

52
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,920
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Drink liquor!

54
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,920
Only you?

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,040
Cheers!

56
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Okay, let’s drink together.

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,280
If you feel sad…

58
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,560
Tell me why we may get drunk.

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,030
I think one gets drunk

60
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,000
because she wishes to get drunk

61
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,250
instead of not being good at drinking.

62
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,280
When you get drunk,

63
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,520
you will forget

64
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,680
everything,

65
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,870
all the happiness and sorrows.

66
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,240
Why do I feel lonely?

67
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,840
I never felt lonely

68
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
when I was alone before.

69
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,590
Do you still remember

70
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
the first time we met each other

71
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,430
in the Silver City?

72
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
In the casino,

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,080
you looked like a wild deer

74
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,430
to me.

75
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,800
You didn’t care about

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
all the crises around you.

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
You always went ahead

78
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,630
bravely

79
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,280
regardless of any constraints.

80
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,910
I thought

81
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,750
it must feel very good

82
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,030
to stand by your side hand in hand.

83
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,410
He can marry whoever he wants to marry.

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
How about me?

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,870
If you had recognized the pains,

86
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,750
it is better you hadn’t met him then.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,750
The flowers are in blossom,

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,190
but the girl hasn’t come.

89
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,040
What are you talking about?

90
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,270
Drink liquors!

91
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,510
Drink liquors!

92
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,720
It is ready.

93
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Cheers!

94
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,010
Let me do it.

95
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,360
You…

96
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,190
Where is your master?

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,310
What is this?

98
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,830
It works to foster the fetus for her.

99
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,190
You have come just in time.

100
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,560
Just guard here

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,360
later

102
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,800
and don’t allow anybody in,

103
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,160
particularly Prince Jun.

104
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,720
What are you going to do in this suit?

105
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,540
I…

106
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,280
Wait for me!

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,800
Zhao is really a rookie in drinking.

108
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
He vomited.

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,240
It is really strange.

110
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,000
Why do I think of him in dream

111
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,270
and in reality alike?

112
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,680
Who is that?

113
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
Put me down!

114
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,660
Put me down! Bottoms up again!

115
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,160
Put me down!

116
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,680
Are you

117
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,950
Li Qingliu who is as cold as ice

118
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,950
and keeps speaking stabbing words?

119
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
Just remember,

120
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,600
I am your husband.

121
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,570
Husband? I have no husband!

122
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,920
I only have liquors!

123
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
Drink with me!

124
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,600
Where are you taking me?

125
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,720
Your Highness! What’s up?

126
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,600
Where is she?

127
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,600
Who?

128
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,720
Aoyi, where is she?

129
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,190
Prince Jun’s wife is pregnant.

130
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
How can she roam about…

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,340
Prince Jun’s wife?

132
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,200
I will punish you severely

133
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,150
if you

134
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,890
call it again.

135
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

136
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,300
You woke up.

137
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,600
What happened to me?

138
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,870
What do you think happened?

139
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,460
You are pregnant.

140
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,270
But you got drunk totally at a whorehouse.

141
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,030
How did you find me?

142
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,440
Haven’t I made it clear enough?

143
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,870
I didn’t expect you
to drink at a whorehouse.

144
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,690
What’s wrong with drinking?

145
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,340
What’s wrong with visiting a whorehouse?

146
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,410
You can undress

147
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,450
Du Xiaoxian in a room.

148
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,980
You don’t have to care about my drinking.

149
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,170
Undressing? What are you talking about?

150
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,380
I saw it all tonight.

151
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,380
It is a misunderstanding.

152
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,770
You got it wrong.

153
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,280
Whatever!

154
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,500
She is the hostess

155
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,570
of Prince Jun’s Mansion in the future.

156
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,480
Nobody can stop you from undressing,

157
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,410
let alone sleeping together.

158
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,770
It is really a shame for me

159
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,620
to sleep with you without any engagement.

It is really true that

179
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,770
all members of the royal family

180
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,050
take flirting with girls

181
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,410
as romance and love.

182
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,680
What are you talking about?

183
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,220
I mean you will branch out and have

184
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,340
numerous wives and concubines.

185
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,550
What a shame!

186
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,690
My map!

187
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,770
What is this?

188
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,290
Map of Official Channel
for Water Transport.

189
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,020
= Chang’an =

190
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,740
Where did you get it?

191
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,530
I had my way!

192
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,500
Don’t think I went out just for drinking.

193
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,260
Look!

194
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,380
You know why the carrying capacity

195
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,530
of water transport remains low now?

196
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,050
It is because the government

197
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,050
only recognizes this channel.

198
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,770
The official channel is
mostly blocked now.

199
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,170
But part of it

200
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,380
must still work well.

201
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,500
If we also use civil water channels

202
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,690
together with the official channel,

203
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,570
we will certainly
increase the transport efficiency.

204
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,690
Your solution involves too many detours

205
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,500
and it is similarly troublesome.

206
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
How about we do it in a phased manner?

207
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,340
The government

208
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,020
uses a single boat for the whole trip.

209
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,860
Considering the varying width of

210
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,240
river course and different
flow conditions,

211
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,100
one boat can’t avail its optimal capacity.

212
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,020
If we use lake boats and river boats

213
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,260
alternatively,

214
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,020
we will certainly save time and labor.

215
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,410
Do you mean using different boats
for different channels?

216
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,340
Exactly, promoting it in a phased manner.

217
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,260
Isn’t it the branch out

218
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,220
that you mentioned just now?

219
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,410
I think it is feasible!

220
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,050
I mean you…

221
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,620
It isn’t something expensive.

222
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,530
It is for you.

223
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,810
It is the bamboo

224
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,340
you lost during the Shangsi Festival.

225
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,170
Did you

226
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,860
carve it yourself?

227
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,480
Actually, opening the water channel again

228
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,570
not only addresses the famine of Chang’an

229
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,860
and the military grain undersupply
in the north,

230
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,120
but also promotes interregional trades

231
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,370
as it involves shipbuilding,
channel opening

232
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,010
and other works.

233
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,620
To the Tang Dynasty, it is a good way

234
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,300
to improve people’s wealth and livelihood.

235
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,600
You didn’t seem to be so patriotic before.

236
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,140
In the past,

237
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,610
I only cared about
the techniques of Sichuan embroidery

238
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,660
and the businesses of the Li family.

239
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
But now, I find

240
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,050
I have the ability to do more.

241
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,390
You finally share the same idea as me.

242
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,410
Doing businesses with all and

243
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,190
providing living breads for your brothers.

244
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,350
Not only brothers,

245
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,360
but all people.

246
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,770
Yes, all people.

247
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,720
How do you think about

248
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,970
the tasks I allocated two days ago?

249
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,240
Father, I have some opinions.

250
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,240
I have submitted them to the Secretariat.

251
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,390
Okay, you take the lead.

252
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,790
The secret to facilitating water transport

253
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,080
lies in salt instead of water.

254
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,130
What do you mean?

255
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,910
Waterborne grain transport
is mostly done directly now.

256
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,580
If we can promote it in phases

257
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,880
by banning riverboats from the Bian River,

258
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,050
Bian riverboats from the Yellow River,

259
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,790
and Yellow River boats from the Wei River,

260
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,670
we can manage to reduce consumptions

261
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,030
and transport costs.

262
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,320
Do you mean

263
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,790
single channel for single boat?

264
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,440
Exactly.

265
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,120
All boats

266
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,960
can access all river courses now.

267
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
It is certainly congested
to slow down the transport.

268
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,840
If a gate is set between river courses,

269
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,320
we can distribute the boats

270
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,080
and speed up the transport.

271
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,000
But we need the cooperation

272
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,000
from civil water transport capacities.

273
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,560
The official channels are
in a good condition

274
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,090
and alternate use
of official and civil channels

275
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,170
will work effectively.

276
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,810
This is a good solution.

277
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,150
How do you think about it?

278
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,790
This is a good idea

279
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,870
as if it had tips from an expert.

280
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,600
It is closely linked,

281
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,670
particularly the idea of phased promotion.

282
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,510
Zhao’s idea is very good

283
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,790
and a little better than mine.

284
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,190
I won’t introduce mine anyway.

285
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,910
Father!

286
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,600
I have the same idea as Prince Zhao.

287
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,950
This is my report.

288
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,660
It seems

289
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,240
Prince Jun is also looking for

290
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,780
favors and rewards from His Majesty.

Prince Jun may have picked up

296
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,510
the wrong one accidentally.

297
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,480
Calm down, Father.

298
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,670
Prince Jun must have made a mistake

299
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,920
due to hastiness.

300
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,830
Prince Jun is a new comer to the court

301
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,720
and knows little about the rules here.

302
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,520
He was eager to make contributions

303
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,310
and forgot

304
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,870
the basic rules.

305
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,440
You should have known the rules.

306
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,720
Go and learn family history compilation
at the Imperial Academy first.

307
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,720
You need to have a sober mind

308
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,960
in order to protect the sovereignty.

309
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,070
History compilation is
equivalent to relegation.

310
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,830
Don’t you see that

311
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,050
it is His Majesty’s protection
of Prince Jun?

312
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,780
Okay.

313
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,520
This is a solution

314
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,680
offered by Prince Zhao.

315
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,070
Prince Zhao will be in charge of it.

316
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,070
Yes, I will.

317
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,400
I will certainly honor Father’s trust.

318
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,510
You are dismissed.

made such a mistake.

Only Aoyi and I knew about it.

How about the water transport?

in the spotlight at the court?

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,800
Why did you mention Prince Zhao?

347
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,340
Why do you look in such a poor condition?

348
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,340
Are you sick?

349
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,410
Are you coming to see my embarrassment?

350
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,410
Just go to see a doctor if you feel sad.

351
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,780
Don’t be furious with me.

352
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,580
I am going out for a walk.

353
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,410
What?

354
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
Is he out of his mind?

355
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,930
It is about the branch out!

356
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,410
The idea offered by Prince Zhao

357
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,740
is exactly the same as that of Master

358
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,830
but Master’s report is lost.

359
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,210
So His Majesty was very angry about it.

360
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,260
Everything went on smoothly today.

361
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,690
I must thank you for your meticulous plan

362
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,780
and your swap of Prince Jun’s report.

363
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,780
It is okay.

364
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,020
You don’t have to tell me personally.

365
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,240
Yue’er,

366
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,830
tell Prince Zhao this plan right away.

367
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,650
Hurry up!

368
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,170
Are you really sure of it?

369
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,170
Aren’t you trapping Prince Jun this way?

370
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,370
Do you expect me to see them

371
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,450
going together

372
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,890
and becoming a couple?

373
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,100
If we are in the same boat,

374
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,410
I hope you can do me a favor.

375
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,060
Please go ahead, Your Highness!

376
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,410
You are in a hard situation now

377
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,370
because you are not pregnant.

378
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,580
So

379
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,690
things will change completely

380
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,260
if that baby is gone.

381
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,370
Do you mean

382
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,370
I should get rid of the baby

383
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,980
of Long Aoyi?

384
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
I didn’t expect

385
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,020
you would

386
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,410
harm your beloved!

387
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,020
It depends on

388
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,410
the truthfulness of the pregnancy.

389
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,780
How could a pregnant woman
drink at a tavern?

390
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,210
Her pregnancy is false?

391
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,100
It is inconvenient for me
to visit the harem.

392
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,690
Please help me

393
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,340
go and confirm it.

394
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,650
Pardon me?

395
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,650
Miss said

396
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,610
the comb that Your Highness had given her

397
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,850
was lost in the backyard

398
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,100
and she asked you to find it for her.

399
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,100
She asked me to look for it
in the darkness?

400
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,260
No, I will go and search for it.

401
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,300
She said
Your Highness must look for it personally.

402
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,060
She said she had lost it

403
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,340
when making pickled plums for you.

404
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,260
Okay.

405
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,890
I will do it tomorrow morning.

406
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,210
Yes, yes,

407
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,580
look for it tomorrow morning!

408
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,450
Go, go, go.

409
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,100
With the comb lost,

410
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,260
Miss won’t fall asleep tonight and

411
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,410
she will hurt herself without good sleep.

412
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,930
Then her baby will be hurt.

413
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,820
Pure menace!

414
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
I was scared.

415
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,450
Don’t you know he is feeling bad now?

416
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,060
I…

417
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,170
Where are the lamps on the lawn?

418
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,100
Lady Long took away all the lamps.

419
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,890
What is she going to do?

420
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,110
♪ I embarked on the journey
when I was young ♪

421
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,540
♪ Now I have experienced everything
and I’m still alone ♪

422
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:40,050
♪ I ever lost myself and complained ♪

423
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,840

424
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,150

427
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,970
♪ I’d like to be with you
for the rest of my life ♪

428
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,450
Miss said

429
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,850
there are too many attractions
in the world

430
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,340
the more one is concerned,
the easier he will be confused.

431
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,260
You will see clearly

432
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,340
your original intent

433
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,740
only after all the attractions are gone.

434
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,380
♪ Let’s watch the misty Spring rain ♪

435
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,610
Where is she?

436
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,850
Miss doesn’t like all these courtesies.

437
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,890
She racked her mind for them
the whole morning

438
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,930
but felt awkward

439
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,410
upon saying them.

440
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,480
So she asked me to tell you on her behalf.

441
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,340
I forgot my original intent

442
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,100
after long stay at the court.

443
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:42,480

444

446
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,650
Let’s go. Hurry up!

00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,930
♪ We get together ♪

448
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,090
Sing a song for me.

449
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,650
Don’t just focus on eating.

450
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,800
Hurry up, sing a song for me.

451
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,040
Sing a song.

452
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,010
Sing a song after eating.

453
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,410
Great to see you, Your Highness!

454
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,170
Hurry up.

455
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,500
Eggplant, Eggplant!

456
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,300
What did you call it, Eggplant?

457
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,650
Eggplant is an exotic bird.

458
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,610
I know it.

459
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,020
I have grown up off the court

460
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,820
and I am good friends of these birds,

461
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,890
including this one.

462
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,930
Your Highness,

463
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,410
let’s go to the backyard

464
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,780
for a walk with it.

465
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,170
I believe it will start singing then.

466
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,780
Good idea.

467
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,450
Hurry up!

468
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,340
Eggplant!

469
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,370
Eggplant!

470
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,500
Show me

471
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,890
how you sing a song later.

472
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,080
Take it easy, Your Highness,

473
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,320
I will make it sing for you.

474
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,750
Good, good!

475
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,420
Great to see you, Your Highness!

476
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,010
Eggplant!

477
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,060
Good to see you too.

478
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,780
Long said

479
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,210
she could make Eggplant sing a song.

480
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,690
Don’t believe

481
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,980
the nonsense of the ignorant people.

482
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,710
A bird will sing

483
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,270
when a couple meets each other

484
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,510
or two males are battling.

485
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,680
So I have bought this bird at a high cost

486
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,920
from the Arabia.

487
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,950
Great, a couple meets each other!

488
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,200
Long, how do you think about it?

489
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,200
Good idea.

490
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,030
Just try

491
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,470
Miss Du’s method first.

492
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,470
Yue’er,

493
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,030
come on.

494
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,400
Eggplant!

495
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,640
Don’t sleep. Hurry up.

496
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,440
Sing a song.

497
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,290
Look, look.

498
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,360
Sing a song.

499
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,400
Sing a song, Eggplant!

500
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,450
Sing a song!

501
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,680
Sing a song!

502
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,600
Don’t keep silent.

503
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,200
Look, isn’t it beautiful?

504
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,470
A caged phoenix is inferior to a chicken.

505
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,080
Even a chicken in the cage

506
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,310
crows for a little while.

507
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,030
What a pity!

508
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,550
What are you doing, Long?

509
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,600
Your Highness, trust me this time!

510
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,990
Why did you

511
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,120
release Eggplant?

512
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,160
Eggplant!

513
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,930
Come down, come down, Eggplant!

514
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,460
Eggplant, come down here!

515
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,160
Eggplant, come down, Eggplant.

516
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,710
Listen, it is singing, Your Highness!

517
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,240
Great!

518
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,000
Melodious.

519
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,920
Really melodious.

520
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,330
Melodious.

521
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,460
A bird loves freedom.

522
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,880
Without freedom,

523
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,930
even a gold cage

524
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,570
is a jail for it.

525
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,470
Only liberty

526
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,680
will liberate its natural instincts

527
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,760
and cause it to sing a song.

528
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,400
Hundreds of silver ingots

529
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,360
were gone in no time.

530
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,790
It sounds reasonable.

531
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,840
The imperial city

532
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,030
looks beautiful on the surface.

533
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,990
Everybody wants to come in here.

534
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,790
But when you are inside,

535
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,970
you will find

536
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,310
the city walls

537
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,310
have no ending at all.

538
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,400
Everybody is out of control

539
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,790
of his own destiny finally

540
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,710
and becomes something like

541
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,440
a caged bird.

542
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,440
Your Highness,

543
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,710
I hope to show you around the Silver City

544
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
and enjoy yourself there one day.

545
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,750
Your mouth will certainly water

546
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,990
over the foods there although they are not

547
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,280
as valuable as those in the court.

548
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,600
Okay, it is a deal!

549
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,790
Never let me down!

550
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,950
I bet on it.

551
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,030
Come on.

552
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,200
You can really read my mind.

553
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,680
Take good care of yourself.

554
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,840
Eat more.

555
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,360
I haven’t noticed

556
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,900
your belly growing bigger

557
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,630
these days.

558
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,400
Eat more.

559
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,380
Yes, Your Highness!

560
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,640
Miss,

561
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,470
Prince Zhao doubted about Long Aoyi’s

562
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,880
pregnancy simply because of her drinking.

563
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,230
The evidence isn’t enough.

564
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
I have inquired about it with the

565
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Stewardess Office and Imperial Hospital

566
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,510
these days.

567
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,470
I have even asked the Laundry Office.

568
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,790
None of them doubted about it.

569
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,750
Without evidence,

570
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,830
we have to find another way.

571
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,510
Take it easy,

572
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,550
I have dispatched somebody
to keep an eye on Prince Jun’s Mansion.

573
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,660
= Xuanshi Palace =

574
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,240
Your Majesty! Her Highness
is already dead for three full years.

575
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,400
Her remains have been kept in the
forbidden area of the court in these years.

576
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
I am afraid you may harm your health

577
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,110
for excessive sadness.

578
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Please move Her Highness’s remains

579
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,720
to the imperial mausoleum at the soonest.

580
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,480
It is impossible

581
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,960
to move my empress away

582
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,680
and separate her from me.

583
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,590
Your Majesty’s love for Her Highness

584
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,200
is appreciated by all our people.

585
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,310
But

586
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
I am afraid

587
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,310
there is vitality in the court

588
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,720
so that Her Highness will be interrupted

589
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
if her coffin remains in the court.

590
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,750
Yes, Your Majesty!

591
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,000
I agree with Mr. Pang.

592
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,550
Burying is the final settlement
of one’s soul.

593
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,200
If Your Majesty deem it too early

594
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,070
to move Her Highness
into the imperial mausoleum,

595
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I recommend choosing a place of luck

596
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,480
close to the imperial palace

597
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,510
so that

598
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,030
Your Majesty can visit her frequently.

599
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,960
That is a good idea.

600
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,750
Just bury in the mountain

601
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
behind Qinglong Temple.

602
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,030
It is a good place.

603
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,400
Ask the Astronomical Bureau

604
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,030
to determine a day of luck

605
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,200
for the migration.

606
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,950
Make a proper arrangement
for the scripture chanting

607
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,920
and transcendence of the empress.

608
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,960
I will certainly honor your trust.

609
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,400
Master, the carriage is ready.

610
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,290
Lady Long is changing her clothes.

611
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,030
She hopes to show respect to Her Highness.

612
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,350
Don’t keep Her Highness
waiting for too long.

613
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,030
Let’s go.

614
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,720
Yes.

615
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,290
How dare you!

616
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,190
Miss, are you okay?

617
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:34,570
That is all right.

618
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,570
I didn’t mean it.

619
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,500
- My lady, please forgive me.
- It is okay.

620
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,360
Let me change it.

621
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,460
Help me find a new one.

622
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,130
Yes.

623
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,610
Your Highness!

624
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,180
You…

625
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,650
You aren’t pregnant!

626
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,960
Master,

627
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,790
have you and Lady Long…

628
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,480
Your Highness,

629
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,550
Miss

630
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,680
has her difficulties.

631
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,640
Shut up!

632
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,280
Leave me alone here.

633
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,440
How long do you want
to keep me in the darkness

634
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,720
if I hadn’t seen it with my eyes?

635
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,440
You are really too…

636
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,150
Do you want to say

637
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,150
our lower class always love to

638
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,440
do such low things as this,

639
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,670
right?

640
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,150
Don’t you?

641
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,150
My master was killed

642
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,070
and the killer is in Chang’an

643
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,440
and possibly in the court.

644
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,280
This is the only way

645
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,070
I can enter the court.

646
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,460
Long Aoyi,

647
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,550
I thought
we had undergone so such together.

648
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,030
There must be certain trusts

649
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,440
between us.

650
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,590
Why didn’t you

651
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,440
tell me your difficulties earlier?

652
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,510
You don’t trust me at all.

653
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,030
Ironically,

654
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,440
whatever they said,

655
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,710
I have never doubted about you

656
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,960
not even for a single minute.

657
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,320
But you are

658
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,320
really good at lying.

659
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,480
You are really

660
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,030
part of the lower class.

661
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,280
I will go right away.

662
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,400
You will feel happy without me.

663
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,230
I don’t have to

664
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,960
deal with all these lousy formalities

665
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,000
