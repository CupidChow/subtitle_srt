The night market is brightly illuminated.

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,120
The pavilions are crowded with guests.

34
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,030
It is an unusual day today.

35
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,070
The songs are sung until daybreak.

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
Do you know

37
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,280
the meaning of this poem?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,840
Your Highness,

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
we are going to the Zhao’s Mansion

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,670
and attend his birthday party.

41
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,920
We don’t have enough time.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
I want to go nowhere today

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,150
but take a walk at the night market here.

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,320
I remember

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,960
I came here with Mother last time.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,470
Your Highness, how dare

47
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,320
you turn a deaf ear to Her Highness.

48
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,560
You will be punished

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,040
and even I have to suffer from it.

50
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,280
I am really worried.

51
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,230
Your Highness…

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,120
Do you see the lane ahead?

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
It is Yongxing Lane.

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,480
Mother took take me here

55
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,840
to guess lantern riddles

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,070
during the Lantern Festival each year
when I was young.

57
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,560
But she is completely different

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
from who she was then.

59
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,210
Do you think

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,040
I will become somebody like her

61
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,790
one day in the future?

62
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,790
There is a shop selling
delicious osmanthus cake ahead.

63
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,430
Your Highness!

64
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,350
We settled down here at the same time.

65
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,200
But nobody harassed me.

66
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,400
You can’t refuse,

67
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,910
nor can you leave the tribe.

68
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,600
You have no choice but to marry.

69
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,070
Li Qingliu marries the No. 1 warrior

70
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,600
and becomes the mistress.

71
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,230
Oh, it is really great fun.

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
No more kidding.

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,110
I was almost suffocated today

74
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,390
but you were still promoting your tea.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,510
I was trying to create a chance

76
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,720
for you to escape.

77
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,440
You sleep on the floor tonight.

78
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,910
We shouldn’t disturb each other.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,950
Thanks.

80
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,560
Why do you thank me?

81
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,880
For accommodating you here

82
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
or promoting the tea to save you?

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
You don’t have to for either of them.

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,280
I can’t stop you if you wish to come in.

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,630
The tea is soaked

86
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,480
and I don’t think I can sell it.

87
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,180
♪ Brother ♪

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,510
♪ Brother ♪

89
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,370
♪ Brother ♪

90
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,010
It is a night for proposal.

91
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,730
How do you think about it?

92
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,810
How do I think about it?

93
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,620
I have no idea about it.

94
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,250
But I have many other ideas.

95
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,060
For instance?

96
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,250
For instance,

97
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,410
I want to make Longzhu Gang better

98
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,570
and I hope my sisters at Wuyun Pavilion

99
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,850
to have good marriage.

100
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,940
I hope my master is adequately fed

101
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,060
and Xiaoqin has a good husband.

102
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,460
Why do you ask the question?

103
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,500
The sound of chime is beautiful.
Play Se after playing Qin.

104
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,290
The tunes of Sheng and Qing
suit well with each other.

105
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,580
But

106
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,460
you and me.

107
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,100
What do you mean?

108
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,900
I suddenly had a feeling

109
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,050
on the wrestling field.

110
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,530
From the gold thread to Nyuertu,

111
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,290
we seem to back up each other

112
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,580
unconsciously.

113
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,340
Sheng and Qing look different

114
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,700
but generate the same tune.

115
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,290
You say

116
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,580
you wish to make your people

117
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,020
have better days.

118
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,100
I hope

119
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,020
my silk store can grow bigger.

120
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,610
You are talented in designing clothes

121
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,050
and doing businesses.

122
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,460
I also have my experiences in them.

123
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,530
Maybe we can always work together

124
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,050
and help each other to realize dreams

125
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,140
as we are doing now.

126
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,140
You and me

127
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,290
work and realize dreams together?

128
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,700
It sounds a good idea.

129
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,660
Look, I have talent and you have money.

130
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,410
It is not only applicable to
clothes business.

131
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,260
I run a whorehouse and you are the pimp.

132
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,460
I sell pork elbows and you raise pigs.

133
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,490
I am sleepy.

134
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,530
I want to sleep.

135
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,530
Mother,

136
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,340
why are you still here

137
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,100
so late at night?

138
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,580
How will you explain

139
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,580
for what happened tonight?

140
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,820
I have bought your favorite

141
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,970
osmanthus cake.

142
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,660
You really let me down.

143
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,050
Mother, you can eat all delicacies

144
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,370
at the royal palace.

145
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,410
But do you still remember

146
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,530
the taste of osmanthus cake?

147
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,930
The He’s Store at Changle Lane.

148
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,290
Fine, soft

149
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,100
and fragrant.

150
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,460
Do you know

151
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,660
where you should have gone today?

152
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,020
You no longer like osmanthus cake.

153
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,100
I am afraid

154
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,930
you may have forgotten it, too.

155
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,930
It has always been tied on my sword.

156
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,140
I remember

157
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,580
you took me to Yongxing Lane
to guess lantern riddles

158
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,490
during the Lantern Festival each year
when I was young.

159
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,930
This sword tassel

160
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,850
is a gift that you made for me

161
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,370
with a lantern tassel immediately

162
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,340
when I was the first to solve a riddle

163
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,970
at the age of six.

164
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,850
I have always taken it as a treasure

165
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,490
in the past years

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,580
because it is the last time for us

167
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,420
to visit a lantern show together.

168
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,730
From then on,

169
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,460
you have changed completely.

170
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,940
Gradually,

171
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,250
I can’t find you as you used to be.

172
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,060
Zhao,

173
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,770
I hope you can understand

174
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,770
I am doing everything

175
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,650
for the Pang family

176
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,610
and you.

177
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,150
You may not understand it.

178
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,240
But,

179
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,480
you have no right to doubt about it.

180
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,630
I have never doubted about it.

181
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,150
So, I have always been obedient.

182
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,030
I dare not object to your orders.

183
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,030
But there is one thing

184
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,240
I really can’t tolerate.

185
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,720
I can never tolerate teaming up

186
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,840
with Zhao Jin.

187
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,270
It is nothing but acting to the occasion.

188
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,630
But he is different.

189
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
I can never forget his forging evidences

190
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,790
and framing up grandfather

191
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,510
so that our family was nearly destroyed.

192
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,940
I can never forget what he did to you

193
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,890
that night when we were at risk.

194
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,010
I have always blamed myself for not

195
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,060
being able to avenge for my family
and my mother’s humiliation.

196
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,180
I can only see him going up

197
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,730
in his career step by step.

198
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,490
Maintaining superficial peace with him

199
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,730
at the royal court

200
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,370
is the bottom-line of my tolerance.

201
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,340
I can never manage to

202
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,130
flatter him.

203
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,250
I would have been humiliated in vain

204
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,060
if I hadn’t done it this way.

205
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,120
When our family was falsely charged

206
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,840
and almost decapitated in full then,

207
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,270
I had no other choice

208
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,170
but to save our family

209
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,870
and you

210
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,960
at the cost of my chastity

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,390
as he had essential evidences.

212
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,150
I certainly
miss the tastes of osmanthus cake.

213
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,670
But

214
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,270
I must know

215
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,390
what I should and should not do.

216
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,790
Aoyi!

217
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,790
Is younger Mr. Li here?

218
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,390
Our young leader is looking for you.

219
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,960
Get up.

220
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,120
Why are they knocking at the door

221
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,240
so early in the morning?

222
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,240
Is Mr. Li here?

223
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,480
Mr. Li!

224
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,910
Hello, madam,

225
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,240
the battle was finished yesterday.

226
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,270
Are you coming here

227
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,480
to avenge for it now?

228
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,320
Be polite to our warrior.

229
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
Mr. Li,

230
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,670
where is your companion?

231
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,870
He…

232
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,150
Really a handsome man

233
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,480
rarely seen at our tribe!

234
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,080
What have they come here for?

235
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,030
Can’t you judge it by her heavy makeup?

236
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,480
Something good for you again.

237
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,870
Your Highness, bad news,

238
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,870
Prince Zhao left Chang’an secretly.

239
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,200
What?

240
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,200
I told you to keep a close eye on him.

241
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,270
How dare you ignore my order.

242
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,030
If Prince Zhao is harmed,

243
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,360
you will die as a punishment.

244
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,120
Prince Zhao left at night

245
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,480
and I really can’t stop him.

246
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,390
Go and get him right away.

247
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,200
Yes.

248
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,480
Zhao is really too innocent.

249
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,600
Calm down, Your Highness!

250
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,960
His Highness will understand you

251
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,510
sooner or later one day.

252
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,960
Help yourself.

253
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,630
The tea you distributed

254
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,720
has aroused a sensation at Zheluo.

255
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,670
Do you like the tea?

256
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,090
The tea has the fragrance of sticky rice

257
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,480
and it is unlike the fresh tea we drink.

258
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,390
The tea is really soaked and tainted.

259
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,960
It is not fresh tea.

260
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,080
It is …

261
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,510
It is a special technique of our city.

262
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,390
It undergoes pile fermentation
so that the tea leaves become cooked.

263
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,120
It has a neutral nature and sweet taste
and is good for appetite.

264
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,600
He is talking nonsense in a serious way,

265
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,480
exactly the same as me.

266
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
What is the name of the tea?

267
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
It is…

268
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,870
Sir,

269
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
its chunks

270
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,120
look like the Er blocks

271
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,000
we cook here in every family.

272
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,480
Er Tea.

273
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,550
It is Er Tea.

274
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,270
Er Tea?

275
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,150
Exactly,

276
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,840
the Er Tea that is affordable by all,

277
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,630
or Pu’er Tea.

278
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,120
Its name is Pu’er Tea.

279
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,070
Here is the thing.

280
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,160
We plan to purchase the tea.

281
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,590
How much do you have with you now?

282
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,950
I have much with me.

283
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,220
If you like,

284
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,170
I can make…

285
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,300
prepare more for you.

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,310
Okay, we will buy your tea.

287
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,760
Can you provide

288
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,920
some salts and

289
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,830
other provisions we lack here?

290
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,950
Salts? No problem.

291
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,190
It won’t be a problem
if the price is okay.

292
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,170
Now

293
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:33,890
we need to firstly

294
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,290
finish the Pu’er tea order.

295
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,170
Let’s congratulate together.

296
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,050
Okay.

297
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:38,920
Come on.

298
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,460
Cheers.

299
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,930
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

300
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,470
As we have clinched a deal,

301
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,520
why not

302
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
stay here for more days?

303
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,160
That’s true.

304
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,110
It is okay for me.

305
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,070
Thanks for your kindness.

306
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,870
But we still have other businesses to do

307
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,110
and we are heading for Jia’ermu.

308
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,320
Jia’ermu?

309
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Haven’t you heard about it?

310
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,520
The official path leading there

311
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
was destroyed completely
by floods half a month ago.

312
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,700
Half a month ago?

313
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,080
Pack up now.

314
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,030
The path is flooded.

315
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,080
It is useless to stare at the box.

316
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,160
We can’t go to the pass.

317
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,880
Why?

318
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,840
Just go and confirm it.

319
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,880
We can return if it is really destroyed.

320
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
As they said,

321
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,920
the path has been flooded

322
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,270
for long.

323
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,550
The government must have known it.

324
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,640
But if they knew it earlier,

325
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,510
they still allowed us to set out…

326
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,230
Do you mean they purposefully

327
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,990
allowed our trip to the pass?

328
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,160
I have felt curious about the box

329
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,160
sealed with sealing waxes.

330
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,600
Just remove it.

331
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,600
Don’t remove it.

332
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,310
If my suspicions are proven wrong,

333
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
we will just leave an evidence.

334
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,470
What on earth is you plan

335
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,230
when you hesitate in everything?

336
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,120
I have an idea.

337
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,120
I have some smoked sausages

338
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,840
for you here

339
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
and I happened to hear it.

340
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,360
There is a small path near Coyote Lake

341
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,030
leading to the pass and

342
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,510
directly to the capital city of Jia’ermu.

343
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,110
Really? Great!

344
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,710
But you must have someone

345
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,710
who is familiar with this place
as your guide

346
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,680
as it is a very isolated official path of

347
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
the previous dynasty deserted for years.

348
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
You are the right person.

349
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,270
We will arrive soon.
Coyote Lake is ahead.

350
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,640
Okay.

351
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
Why is it so far away?

352
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,030
Do you need a rest?

353
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,750
I have to say

354
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,270
you are popular among all.

355
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,200
Even the daughter of the tribe head

356
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,160
wishes to be your guide.

357
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,200
No kidding.

358
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,920
Look, your girl is coming.

359
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,750
Dabaru,

360
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,080
it takes physical strength

361
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,270
to go hunting in the mountains.

362
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,470
Let me carry the box myself.

363
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,750
We wish to do it voluntarily.

364
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,680
We are strong enough.

365
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,490
Cheer up!

366
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
It is the divine tree ahead,

367
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,880
the border between Tang and Jia’ermu.

368
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,950
It is still a long way to go.

369
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,950
Just hurry up.

370
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,200
Let’s go.

371
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,230
Okay.

372
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,990
We are strong enough.

373
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,680
Hey, what are you murmuring?

374
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,120
We are praying to the divine tree

375
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,600
to protect our tribe and this mountain.

376
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,400
Do you know why our tribe

377
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,790
determines a marriage

378
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,030
through wrestling?

379
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,680
Because

380
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,510
only the one who spares no effort

381
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,030
for you deserves your marriage.

382
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,230
Only the one who spares no effort

383
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,160
for you deserves your marriage.

384
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,360
Young leader, Long really benefits

385
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,400
from what you said today

386
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,470
Long? Aren’t you Li?

387
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,030
My family name is Long.

388
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,080
I entered your tribe by mistake

389
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,950
and so, I didn’t tell you the truth.

390
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,990
I am sorry for it.

391
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,790
My name is Long Aoyi.

392
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,790
Aoyi?

393
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,300
May I call you Aoyi?

394
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,130
Yes.

395
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,060
I will call you Ji then.

396
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,100
Ji,

397
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,690
if the divine tree is here,

398
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,370
where is the border

399
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,130
between Tang and Jia’ermu?

400
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,300
Actually, seeing the divine tree

401
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,020
means you are already in Jia’ermu.

402
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:14,890
Really?

403
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,610
Where is it?

404
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,850
Where is it?

405
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,740
Mr. Li!

406
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,210
Your Highness,

407
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,100
Her Highness will be angry

408
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,450
if you go to the border
by changing horses all day and night.

409
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,930
I don’t care.

410
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,850
Ms. Long’s safety is the most important.

411
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,780
Are you okay?

412
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,370
Don’t play dead. It is not fun at all.

413
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
Li Qingliu,

414
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,480
don’t scare me.

415
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,310
Li Qingliu, wake up.

416
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,510
Get up.

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
We still have a mission to accomplish.

418
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,480
Xiaoqin and Yan Bin are still waiting for us

419
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,350
to do the grain transport business

420
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,480
and make a big fortune.

421
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,030
Aren’t you afraid I take away all money

422
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,350
and leave no penny for you?

423
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,720
Wake up!

424
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,790
Li Qingliu, wake up.

425
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,030
Wait, I will go and ask someone for help.

426
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,270
Are you really leaving now?

427
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,100
Are you giving up a wounded person?

428
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,980
You have gone too far.

429
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,410
Even if I survive the fall,

430
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,610
I may also be rocked to death by you.

431
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,890
What a bastard you are!

432
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,100
Were you really
worried about me just now?

433
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,820
No.

434
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,100
You care about me.

435
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,210
I care about everybody except swindler.

436
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,980
Long Aoyi.

437
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,170
Do you

438
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,060
have no intent

439
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,690
on me at all?

440
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,540
I have.

441
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,300
You bastard

442
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,500
do businesses with me just

443
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,580
to avail the resources of the lower class.

444
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,580
You chanted your hypocritical poem

445
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,410
just to gain the favor of pretty girls.

446
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,500
Your claim to work with me

447
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,450
for businesses on the night of proposal

448
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,340
is also a lie, isn’t it?

449
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,450
It is for you.

450
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,650
Where did you get
such an ugly straw rabbit?

451
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,020
It is a dime a dozen in the street.

452
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,260
It is a misunderstanding on your part.

453
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,850
I sincerely hope to

454
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,370
do businesses with you.

455
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,370
I made this one

456
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,410
in your weaving method.

457
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,100
I have already finished it

458
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,980
before we headed for Coyote Lake.

459
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,850
It is a token of apology.

460
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,820
Smell the fragrance.

461
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,260
I don’t care about it.

462
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,170
Just give it to those goddesses

463
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,980
and female warriors.

464
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,100
They will like it.

465
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,820
If you don’t like it,

466
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,540
I will just throw it away.

467
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,440
No.

468
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,450
Long Aoyi.

469
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,500
What’s up?

470
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,580
I will accept it. Just hurry on our way.

471
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,540
The wrong direction!

472
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,890
I know it.

473
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,260
You don’t need to remind me.

474
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,610
Wait for me!

475
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,340
No.

476
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,110
Your Highness!

477
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,550
I just inquired about it at the pass.

478
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,270
Ms. Long hasn’t gone through it.

479
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,350
Hasn’t gone through it?

480
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,720
Not yet.

481
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,720
Has she encountered an accident?

482
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,510
Don’t worry, Your Highness!

483
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,680
We aren’t sure about it.

484
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,240
Mother requests me to stay away

485
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
from anything involving Du Changfeng.

486
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,240
But Uncle mentioned the Silver City.

487
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
I felt strange about being called back

488
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,590
upon their departure for Jia’ermu.

489
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,750
I believe there must be some linkage.

490
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,750
An accident will certainly occur.

491
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,200
You don’t have to worry.

492
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,960
Ms. Long and Master Li

493
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,160
are just two ordinary citizens
of the Silver City.

494
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,270
No time to explain to you.

495
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,000
Let’s find them as soon as possible.

496
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,640
Where can we find them

497
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,790
in continuous mountains?

498
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,250
Give me the map.

499
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,260
= Silver City Kingdom of Women =

500
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,590
There is a deserted official path here
to cross the border.

501
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,310
Time is limited. Let’s go.

502
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,440
Yes.

503
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,680
No.

504
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,350
No.

505
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,790
Young leader,

506
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,310
where else can Mr. Li go then?

507
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,310
Go and search for them again.

508
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,440
I will guard the fire here.

509
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,720
No, what if wolves come?

510
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,920
You can’t deal with them alone.

511
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,960
Protect the young leader.

512
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,920
Have you heard it?

513
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,030
It is getting dark.

514
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,270
We must hurry up.

515
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,030
What is that?

516
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,550
I think

517
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,750
a roast rabbit will be delicious later.

518
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,920
Aoyi!

519
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,750
Come here, the wolves are approaching.

520
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,070
Where are the wolves?

521
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,200
Have you really seen them?

522
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,270
You haven’t

523
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,480
because there is no wolf at all.

524
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,110
We only have it here.

525
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,830
This

526
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,350
is the wolf that you claim.

527
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,510
This is the wolf?

528
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,350
We found a beach just now

529
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,160
and it was full of stones like this.

530
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
It will howl like a wolf when it is windy.

531
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,240
Most importantly,

532
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,440
the beach has flowing water.

533
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,200
It may be the legendary ancient

534
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,830
water course for trade and commerce.

535
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,440
We traced it for a while and found

536
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,880
the water flowing to the southeast.

537
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,920
So what?

538
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,200
There is only one water course
leading to the southeast.

539
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,030
It is Furong River
outside the Silver City.

540
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,680
That is to say,

541
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
our cargos can be transported

542
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,750
from the Silver City to your tribe

543
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,960
and the tribes around

544
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,790
and your hunting proceeds can also

545
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,240
be delivered to the Silver City for sale.

546
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,680
Really?

547
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,640
I am sure.

548
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,460
Great, Mr. Li.

549
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,830
Great. Great.

550
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,110
Good. Good.

551
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,880
Great.

552
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,960
Mr. Long,

553
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,350
your clothes are dirty.

554
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,510
We have prepared some more clothes

555
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,790
for the hunting.

556
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,830
Just change your clothes.

557
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,920
Okay, thank you.

558
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,510
Thank you.

559
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,270
Which one do you think I shall choose?

560
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,000
One is graceful and the other is wild.

561
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,550
I will choose the axe.

562
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,790
Why not go ahead?

563
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,640
Just throw away your robe and axe.

564
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,440
Why?

565
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,790
It is too ugly.

566
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,960
I think it looks nice.

567
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,590
Look, the fur looks valuable.

568
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,310
It is so majestic, so …

569
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,830
Don’t move.

570
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,400
Why do you freeze me?

571
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,880
Don’t take it off.

572
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,680
Don’t take it off.

573
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,270
They are dressed up gaudily.

574
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,750
I look so plain this way.

575
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,920
My axe!

576
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,000
Where is the straw rabbit?

577
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,070
You, do you wish to take it back?

578
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,110
What are you doing?

579
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,720
Don’t tickle me.

580
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,310
Itchy.

581
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,590
You don’t look plain with it.

582
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,700
People here

583
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,970
are all very brave for their beloved.

584
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,880
How about you?

585
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,640
I…

586
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,750
I…

587
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,310
Love…

588
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,240
Mr. Li, are you finished?

589
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,680
Mr. Li, you look handsome in all clothes.

590
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,030
The roast is ready. Let’s go.

591
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,790
Don’t go away, defreeze me.

592
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,590
I just asked you not to move.

593
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,720
I didn’t freeze you.

594
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,310
What a profiteer and swindler you are!

595
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,480
Mr. Long,

596
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,510
you have brought Pu’er tea to us

597
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,350
and found

598
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,400
the long-lost water course

599
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,830
for us in your trip here.

600
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,590
You must be envoys

601
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
dispatched by the God of Mountains

602
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
to offer us good luck.

603
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,030
So tonight,

604
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,680
we will honor you

605
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,000
with the luckiest dance of fire rings.

606
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,790
What performances
do you have in the Silver City?

607
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,270
singing, dancing or the like.

608
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,880
We have too many of them.

609
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,400
Mr. Long’s Guozhuang Dance is good.

610
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,480
Guozhuang Dance?

611
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,000
It sounds very interesting.

612
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
Do you want to learn it? I can teach you.

613
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:51,750
Okay.

614
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,000
Come on.

615
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,110
Give me your hands.

616
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Come on, go ahead.

617
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,960
Ready, go.

618
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,750

622
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:48,880
Go?

623
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,160
Your Highness,

00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,750
and couldn’t stand up again.

629
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,940
You were worried
about the safety of Ms. Long.

630
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,340
You finally see her now.

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,190
Just surrender yourself and plead guilty.

689
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,400
Violate the laws?

690
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,630
What a bastard you are, Du Changfeng!

691
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

692
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,400
You...

693
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,280
How care you curse me!

694
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,840
Arrest them!

695
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,440
What are you doing?

696
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,840
You bastard!

697
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,190
You showed up suddenly last time.

698
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,670
What crime have we committed?

699
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,710
You take advantage of

700
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,710
escorting Nyuertu to privately deliver

701
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,440
the weapon forging book

702
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,000
out of national border.

703
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,070
According to Tang’s law,

704
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,550
anybody delivering weapons privately

705
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,000
out of borders will be hanged.

706
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,940
= Silver City =

707
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,740
= County Government =

708
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,940
What’s up?

709
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,950
I don’t know.

710
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,710
Sir, I have something to discuss with you.

711
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,000
Our master

712
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,070
is having a trial in there now.

713
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,880
We have no people at the government.

714
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,000
Can you provide

715
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,320
some convenience for us?

716
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,920
Yes.

717
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,760
Here you are.

718
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Tell you the truth.

719
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,710
Our superior already requested us

720
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,400
not to allow anybody in.

721
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,760
Don’t bring me troubles.

722
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,030
- Sir, just give some convenience.
- Sir…

723
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,510
Sir…

724
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,860
= Fair and impartial =

725
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,320
Hushed!

726
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,230
Li Qingliu, leader of the business circle
in the Silver City,

727
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,550
is profit-oriented against justice

728
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,800
by conspiring with Long Aoyi

729
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,150
and other petty swindlers.

730
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,590
In the past years,

731
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,960
the Li’s business represented by Xinsilu

732
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,440
have spread far and wide like a plague.

733
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,590
You privately hid the forging drawings

734
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,960
of Tang Knife and horse spear

735
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,280
in the container of Nyuertu

736
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,070
as business envoys.

737
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,150
You two people

738
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,480
have committed the crime of treason
and ought to be decapitated.

739
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,510
Du,

740
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,670
what are you talking about?

741
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,840
Treason?

742
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,800
I have some questions for you, Mr. Du.

743
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,280
As a commissioner,

744
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,230
do I need to explain to you on it?

745
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,000
It is a felony once you carry

746
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
a weapon forging drawing
out of the national border.

747
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,710
We have

748
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,000
traveled a long distance just for you.

749
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,230
But you secretly plotted a crime on us.

750
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,440
What an evil guy you are!

751
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,550
How dare you say such nonsense here!

752
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,710
You named us business envoys

753
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,110
and traitor successively.

754
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,150
Du Changfeng,

755
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,440
you are really an excellent actor.

756
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,630
You will certainly be a famous actor.

757
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,690
How dare you defame an official!

758
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,110
How dare you defy the law!

759
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,760
When it comes to the law,

760
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,840
the law clearly requires

761
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,590
witnesses and neighbors
to be present at a trial.

762
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,630
Do you respect the national law

763
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,400
when you take felony for granted

764
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,800
just based on dossiers?

765
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,800
You claim we carry weapon forging book
out of national borders.

766
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,800
But the container bears

767
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,550
the sealing wax of the government

768
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,510
and it was handed over to me
by the county governor personally.

769
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,590
The sealing wax is intact now.

770
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,320
How could we put something

771
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,360
into the container without damaging it?

772
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,840
It is said the container was opened

773
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,670
without removing the sealing wax
in the theft case of gold thread.

774
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,960
You are really smart

775
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,710
to use the same trick here.

776
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,400
It further proves

777
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,150
you are the criminals.

778
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,550
I have a question.

779
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,000
We have never mentioned the case of

780
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,440
gold thread to anybody else.

781
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,400
How do you know about it?

782
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,070
Have you known it already

783
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,710
and even got involved in it?

784
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,550
Nonsense!

785
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,880
You can never deny it.

786
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,020
Kill them right here

787
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,460
= Order =
